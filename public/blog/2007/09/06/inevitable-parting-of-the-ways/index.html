<div class="entry-content"><p>When I went to bed, I closed the curtains. Unfortunately even at full
stretch, the curtains only spanned half the width of the window. This
was excellent news as I was able to cancel my 07:30 wake-up call as the
morning sun streaming into the room at 05:45 was just as effective.</p>

<p>The shower worked although it was a little tardy to empty. So slow, I
thought I was going to have a minor flood on my hands but fortunately
the sill was pretty deep and disaster was narrowly avoided.</p>

<p>Breakfast was disappointingly adequate - cereals, bread, cheese, ham,
fruit coffee and tea. The churn labelled &#8216;Milk&#8217; was empty so I took my
chances on an adjacent, unlabelled silver vessel. Consequently, I
drenched my Frosties in natural yoghurt which was an unusual combination
but a pleasant change.</p>

<p>There was also a strange fruit juice which was a hybrid of mango and
orange. Similar to what is called cheap &#8216;Orange Drink&#8217; in England;
neither fresh orange juice nor orange squash and tasting rather
artificial and very sickly.</p>

<p>After breakfast, I decided it would be prudent to double-check on the
availability of the presidential suite in 406 just to ensure that Carol
Smiley, &#8216;Handy Andy&#8217; and Laurence Llewlyn-Bowen had finished building
walk-in wardrobes from MDF and covering the bed in dark red, Gothic
materials.</p>

<p>Slowly and carefully, I explained the situation and the pretty
receptionist duly confirmed &#8216;Yes. Mr. Anderson. I have you booked into
room 406 for 4 nights.&#8217;</p>

<p>I immediately crossed over to the Hilton, heaved a huge sigh of relief
as the desk told me they had some availability and booked in for two
nights. I crossed back over the road and checked out of Grand Central 2
days early, claiming my Grandmother had just died and I had to return to
England immediately.</p>

<p>The nightmare was finally over. Only it wasn&#8217;t. The young lady on
reception was a new-hire and couldn&#8217;t process my booking (or
cancellation) using my credit card. Finally, with the unconvincing words
&#8216;OK. I have read the big book and I think I have done it now&#8217;, I left,
thankful to make my escape.</p>

<p>I am now installed in the Hilton which is bland and very overpriced but
it&#8217;s like going into Macdonalds, you know exactly what you are going to
get.</p>

<p>Pity really as the Dutch version of &#8217;<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/11/16/flowery-twats/">Flowery
Twats</a>&#8217; would
undoubtedly have provided a wealth of valuable blogging material for the
next 48 hours.</p>
