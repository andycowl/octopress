<div class="entry-content"><p>A minor irritant with uninteresting email cluttering up my Inbox has
resulted in some minor changes to my Web 2.0 first-team squad.</p>

<p><a href="http://akismet.com/">Akismet</a>, the popular and widely used anti-spam
solution, was letting an increasing trickle of irritating comment and
trackback spam through. As I had configured email notification for all
blog comments, this was generating pointless, tedious, worthless emails
that simply had to be deleted. A complete waste of time and energy.</p>

<p>Initially, I toyed with the option to simply disable comments on
articles older than 90 days which accounted for 95% of the spam but
would block authors with valid contributions.</p>

<p>A little research revealed a possible alternative - <a href="http://unknowngenius.com/blog/wordpress/spam-karma/">Spam
Karma</a>. I was
loosely aware of Spam Karma from the footer in Tim Hall&#8217;s excellent
<a href="http://www.oracle-base.com/blog">blog</a></p>

<blockquote><p>This blog is protected by <a href="http://unknowngenius.com/blog/" title="Dave">dr
Dave</a>&#8217;s Spam Karma 2: 23182
Spams eaten and counting&#8230;</p></blockquote>

<p>as well as Andy Beard&#8217;s positive
<a href="http://andybeard.eu/2007/05/akismet-spam-karma.html">review</a> and useful
tutorial on configuring Spam Karma.
Initially, the Spam Karma interface was a little confusing. With
Akismet, you literally set and forget whereas Spam Karma has a
configuration page with a plethora of different options. Anyway, after
deciding to start out with the default, out of the box settings, I just
activated Spam Karma and waited.</p>

<p>Sure enough, the never ending barrage of spam trickled in and the vast
majority were correctly marked as such, valid comments were allowed
through and I couldn&#8217;t detect any false positives.</p>

<p>The moderation mechanism wasn&#8217;t quite as obvious as Akismet which
emailed me whenever a comment was held for moderation. However, Spam
Karma was actually better as moderated comments are held in the Spam
list and can be quickly moderated from there. In addition, Spam Karma
can email a daily/weekly digest summarising recent activity.</p>

<p>I have been running Spam Karma for almost a week now and not a single
comment/trackback spam has got past the barriers yet. A truly impressive
and valuable piece of software.</p>

<p>A few features in Spam Karma I really like:</p>

<ul>
<li>All comments are assigned a score depending on various criteria.</li>
<li>Comments on older articles get penalised&#8230;</li>
<li>&#8230;but older articles with recent (valid) comment activity score
higher.</li>
<li>Instant comments within seconds of viewing get penalised.</li>
<li>First-time commenters are presented with a captcha.</li>
<li>Established commenters are recognised and scored accordingly.</li>
<li>Trackbacks without a valid reference URL are penalised.</li>
<li>My comments score higher than anyone elses :-)</li>
<li>A detailed breakdown of the score assigned to any comment is
available.</li>
</ul>


<blockquote><p>-12.5 \
 0: Encrypted payload valid: IP matching.\
 -2: Browser doesn&#8217;t support Javascript\
 0.5: Comment has no URL in content (but one author URL)\
 -2: Flash Gordon was here (comment posted 8 seconds after page
load).\
 -9: Entry posted 7 months, 3 weeks ago. 0 comments in the past 15
days.\
 Current Karma: -3.</p></blockquote>

<p>I was so impressed I donated $20 to the author and that doesn&#8217;t happen
very often.
Another source of unnecessary email was valid blog comments (albeit much
fewer). The solution for this was obvious. Subscribe to my own comments
feed and read them in Google Reader.</p>

<p>Another source of Web 2.0 irritation was that the Firefox extension for
<a href="http://www.cocomment.com/">coComment</a> broke some of the drilldowns in
the revamped Google Analytics reports so I reluctantly stopped using it.
This was a real shame as coComment was one of these Web 2.0
applications, I actually used on a daily basis.</p>

<p>Again, I looked for an alternative and installed
<a href="http://co.mments.com/">co.comments</a> (yeah I know - it&#8217;s a Web 2.0
domain with an embedded period) which works fine. There is a Firefox
bookmarklet (not an extension) so the author has to remember to mark any
comments posted whereas coComment automatically tracked these
&#8216;conversations&#8217;.</p>

<p>The other advantage of the coComment extension was automatic
notification whenever a comment was added to a tracked conversation.</p>

<p>Again, the solution for this issue was obvious. I simply subscribed to
the RSS feed for my tracked conversations and read them in Google
Reader.</p>
