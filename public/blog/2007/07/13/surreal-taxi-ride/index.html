<div class="entry-content"><p>Last Thursday, I enjoyed an superbly entertaining taxi ride back from
LHR. Unusually, the taxi driver wasn&#8217;t waiting for me at the meeting
point. I called the taxi company and was told he was &#8216;3 minutes away&#8217;.
He was actually 10 minutes away but, to be fair, he was extremely
apologetic when he arrived.</p>

<p>The driver was a rather tall, imposing, Indian gentleman. Once in the
car, he immediately got into a protracted and increasingly heated
argument with the dispatcher about the address for his next drop-off.
The dispatcher insisted the location was &#8216;Surbiton&#8217; with no address. Not
unreasonably, the driver argued that he needed an exact address.</p>

<p>Finally, he turned to me and asked &#8216;Sir. May I ask you for your address
?&#8217; so I obliged. He then exploded at the dispatcher who eventually
conceded that my address was indeed correct, wasn&#8217;t actually &#8216;Surbiton&#8217;
and did include a road and house number.</p>

<p>Puzzled, I asked the driver why he simply didn&#8217;t ask him where I lived
when I got into the car. &#8216;Because you, Sir, are the customer and I
shouldn&#8217;t have to pester you just because I work with complete idiots.&#8217;</p>

<p>He then informed me that &#8216;while he wasn&#8217;t a racialist (sic), British
people were all incredibly stupid&#8217; and proceeded to expand this sweeping
generalisation with the startling fact that &#8216;last years Mensa study
reported that 68% of the world&#8217;s population was below average
intelligence.&#8217;</p>

<p>He then proceeded to regale me with a variety of hilarious anecdotes
from just two years in the minicab business.</p>

<p>One lady asked &#8216;Are you a cab ?&#8217; to which he replied &#8216;No, madam. I am
not a cab. I am a taxi driver so please do not leap onto my shoulders.&#8217;</p>

<p>Another teenager asked if she could smoke in the car. He politely
pointed to the &#8216;No Smoking&#8217; signs clearly displayed and said &#8216;No. I&#8217;m
sorry madam. That won&#8217;t be possible.&#8217; Undeterred, she then asked &#8216;How
much extra would it cost to smoke ?&#8217;. &#8216;Well, madam, if you pay me the
current market value of this car, I will get the bus home, you can drive
this car to your garage and you can smoke there all night long.&#8217;</p>

<p>On another balmy summer evening, a rich lady from Mayfair didn&#8217;t answer
the door or phone for 15 minutes. When she eventually deigned to open
the front door and announced &#8216;she had been sitting out in the back
garden with a glass of wine because it was sunny&#8217;, he replied &#8216;You&#8217;re
right. It is a lovely evening so I am ending my shift right now and
going to sit in my garden with a glass of wine&#8217;. He promptly left her
standing, speechless, on the doorstep.</p>

<p>Another customer threatened to call the office because the driver was
slightly late and he had a flight to catch. He said &#8216;Well it&#8217;s not my
fault that I&#8217;m late. Blame the idiots working at this company.&#8217; When the
customer said &#8216;That is outrageous. I am going to call your manager&#8217;, he
replied &#8216;Sir, you can call New Scotland Yard for all I care.&#8217;</p>

<p>But my favourite story involved another rich lady. It was late on
Saturday night, the roads were busy and the driver wasn&#8217;t familiar with
the area so he started to enter the destination address into the SatNav
system.</p>

<p>The well spoken lady said &#8216;Oh don&#8217;t bother with that. Just follow that
blue Mercedes&#8217;. My friend said &#8216;Certainly madam but I really would like
to key in the address as well if you don&#8217;t mind.&#8217; The lady said &#8216;Look.
I&#8217;ve already told you once. Just do what you&#8217;re told and follow the blue
Mercedes.&#8217;</p>

<p>The driver complied. 25 minutes later, the blue Mercedes pulled into a
driveway. The taxi driver pulled up at the kerb and stopped. He looked
into the back seat. His well dressed female passenger was asleep and
suddenly awoke. &#8216;Are we there ye - What are we doing here ? Where the
hell are we ?&#8217;.</p>

<p>The driver gestured to the car in the darkened driveway: &#8216;Madam, you
told me to follow the blue Mercedes.&#8217;</p>
