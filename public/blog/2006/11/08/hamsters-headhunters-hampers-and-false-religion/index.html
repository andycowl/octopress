<div class="entry-content"><p>I never used to work from home much. When the kids were younger, my wife
was at home and without an office, quiet room or even a shed, I found it
difficult to concentrate. Accessing the work network over dial-up also
was a significant constraint.</p>

<p>Now things are different. My children are both at secondary school and
leave the house before I do. My wife also works and I have a broadband
connection and VPN access to the office network. So, occasionally, I can
save two hours commuting, sit down with a decent cup of tea, be
productive and still be back home in time for tea.</p>

<p>Apart from today, that is. My wife isn&#8217;t working today but worse than
that, a pet hamster has effected a miraculous escape overnight. I had
noticed that he was looking deeply upset after United&#8217;s shock defeat at
Southend and chewing frantically at the bars but I never thought he
would do anything like this.</p>

<p>The rodent is now on the loose so all floor fittings have been detached
and every dark nook and cranny has been examined with a high powered
flashlight.</p>

<p>Of course, the hamster hasn&#8217;t been found. He probably got too
inquisitive and is starving to death somewhere under the floorboards.
That is, if he managed to avoid the mouse poison.</p>

<p>So the search is called off (by me) and suspended by my wife who has
gone to share the terrible news with friends over an overpriced
Cappuccino.</p>

<p>Peace at last. Until my daughter sends me a text &#8216;found him yet ?&#8217;.
Plagued by guilt, I get a torch out and scan under the furniture and
fireplace yet again. Then I put his cage on the floor with a tasty
pumpkin seed placed outside to tempt him back to his metal prison.</p>

<p>Peace at last. Back to what I should be working on. Music on. Oh no, I
forgot. No music is allowed as I am supposed to be listening for
hamster-like rustling noises. Funny how the washing machine is exempt
from this noise curfew.</p>

<p>Peace at last. Knock at the front door. Some delivery from Next. Sign.
Thanks.</p>

<p>Peace at last. Another knock at the door. Two female religious nuts who,
thankfully (for their sake) decide not to preach at me for ten minutes
but instead just push a leaflet into my hand titled &#8216;THE END OF FALSE
RELIGION IS NEAR !&#8217; with the intriguing bullet points</p>

<ul>
<li>What is false religion ?</li>
<li>How will it end ?</li>
<li>How will you be affected ?</li>
</ul>


<p>This is clearly a sign from God. I tell the ladies that my wife is out,
I have the house all to myself and the kettle has just boiled. I invite
them in and ask whether they are qualified to officiate over a funeral
for a hamster. Curiously, they look aghast and leave. Maybe I shouldn&#8217;t
have flicked my dressing gown so wide open.</p>

<p>Finally, peace at last. Check my email. Curiously, I have a voicemail
from my office extension. This is strange because hardly anyone has
access to this number. I can never remember it without looking at my
business card. My wife doesn&#8217;t know it and hardly anyone I know has ever
used it.</p>

<p>I play the WAV that is consuming 500KB of disk space. Inevitably, it is
a recruitment consultant who &#8216;has spoken to some people who know me very
well, think very highly of me and just happen to think I might just be
interested in some vacuous pre-sales role dealing with some of the
biggest blue chip companies in, not just the UK, but Europe.&#8217; Thanks but
no thanks. Delete the message and return to the document I should be
writing.</p>

<p>Peace at last. Until the telephone rings. Some direct marketeer brings
me tidings of great joy. My wife and I have won a Christmas Hamper. I am
immediately suspicious and ask if this is surplus stock
from<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/wiltshire/6115626.stm">Farepak</a>.
She assures me that it isn&#8217;t and tells me that my wife and I just need
to come to a local hotel on Saturday to collect this hamper.</p>

<p>I ask why they can&#8217;t just send it. Because I have to collect it with my
wife. Can&#8217;t my wife just pop over and collect it ? No. My wife and I
must both collect it. Why - is the hamper really that heavy ? No. I ask
if there is any type of &#8216;presentation&#8217; involved. No there isn&#8217;t. It is
just a free Christmas hamper. What&#8217;s in the hamper ? I can&#8217;t tell you.
Finally, I say I am not interested and hang up.</p>

<p>Wife returns. She asks whether Julia has called to confirm the
appointment about the Christmas Hamper. I tell her the bad news. She
then asks whether I have heard any hamster-like noises and I tell her
more bad news. No hamster-like rustlings but plenty of interruptions.</p>

<p>I finally give up. I put a collared shirt on, and drive to the office.
Peace at last.</p>
