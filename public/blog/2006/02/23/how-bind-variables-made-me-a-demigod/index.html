<div class="entry-content"><p>In a previous life, I was a development DBA. Sorry that&#8217;s not quite
true. My job title was &#8216;Persistence Architect&#8217; for a J2EE application.
The Oracle database wasn&#8217;t really considered to be a database. In fact,
it wasn&#8217;t even considered to be a repository either. The database was
merely a means of persisting objects.</p>

<p>There was a swear box for the terms &#8216;Table&#8217;, &#8216;Column&#8217;, &#8216;Database&#8217;,
&#8216;record, &#8216;schema&#8217;, &#8216;SELECT&#8217; and bizarrely, &#8216;PMON&#8217;. This meant I had to
resurrect the word &#8216;tuple&#8217;.</p>

<p>Anyway, I was responsible for the production system which was lightly
loaded and adequately configured so life was easy and I could blog and
surf all day. Well, actually I couldn&#8217;t because I didn&#8217;t blog back then
and I was behind a corporate firewall so I just had some EJB&#8217;s and the
complete Oracle 9i documentation set for company.</p>

<p>One Friday, a developer came along and asked me to restart the DEV
database. I asked &#8216;Why ?&#8217;. He replied &#8216;Because it is the second Friday
in the month&#8217;. I asked &#8216;Why ?&#8217;. &#8216;Because we restart it every two weeks
at Friday lunchtime&#8217;. &#8216;Why ?&#8217;. &#8216;Because that&#8217;s what Bryan used to do&#8217;
&#8216;Why ?&#8217;. &#8216;To fix the Oracle bug where we can&#8217;t instantiate any more
objects&#8217;. &#8216;What Oracle bug ?&#8217;. &#8216;Look - I really don&#8217;t know - some stupid
low level Oracle error. Please just restart it&#8217;.</p>

<p>Ten minutes investigations revealed he was indeed speaking the truth.
The Oracle listener was failing with &#8216;Unable to fork process&#8217; due to a
lack of resources. Just like the objects, database connections were also
persisted. This was a development Solaris server with lots of components
co-hosted with 2 CPU, 512 MB memory and a paltry 128 MB swap space.
Configured more swap space, ordered more memory. Job done.</p>

<p>Everyone was happy. All objects could be instantiated successfully and I
didn&#8217;t have to set a fortnightly reminder to restart Oracle on Friday
lunchtime.</p>

<p>So, I was able to return to the &#8216;Concepts&#8217; guide and my status was
elevated from &#8216;quiet man in corner&#8217; to &#8216;Hero&#8217;.</p>

<p>A couple of months later, I was asked to look into the &#8216;appalling lack
of performance scalability&#8217; of the database on UAT. Apparently, during
load tests, the J2EE application could only process 800 transactions per
hour. Well, they weren&#8217;t actually conventional database transactions but
rather complex, involved business processes.</p>

<p>UAT had a 128 MB buffer cache and a 1 GB shared pool. Odd. The shared
pool was littered with lots of almost identical SQL statements with
embedded literals. I suspect the shared pool was originally 128 MB, the
library cache hit ratio was low and some performance tuning wizard
(human or otherwise) recommended &#8216;Low library cache hit ratio means
increase shared pool immediately&#8217;. Repeat ad infinitum.</p>

<p>I summoned up the courage and talked to the developers. &#8216;Would it be
possible to modify the application to use bind variables ?&#8217; &#8216;No. Listen.
We just use objects. We don&#8217;t make database calls&#8217;. Some more
investigations. The J2EE application uses TopLink which is an interface
layer translating the objects into database accesses.</p>

<p>I decided to read the TopLink manual and suggested setting the TopLink
configuration parameter &#8216;should-bind-all-parameters&#8217; to True and repeat
the test. While the development team made the changes, I reduced the
shared pool to 128MB and increased the buffer cache to 1GB.</p>

<p>Repeat test. Staggering improvement to over 3,000 &#8216;transactions&#8217; per
hour.</p>

<p>My status is immediately elevated to &#8216;demigod&#8217;. Why, they were so
grateful, a Java developer finally divulged the proxy they were all
using to access the internet.</p>

<p>I created my own private swear box for the terms &#8216;EJB&#8217;, &#8216;J2EE&#8217;,
&#8216;Container Managed Persistence&#8217;, &#8216;multiple inheritance&#8217;, &#8216;classes&#8217;,
&#8216;methods&#8217;, &#8216;destructors&#8217; and &#8216;Persistence Architect&#8217; and returned to
quietly reading the fine Oracle manuals.</p>
