<div class="entry-content"><p>A few years ago, I worked for a small internet company and was a
successful dot com millionaire. Then the confounded Italians went and
devalued the Lira.</p>

<p>We spent (wasted) lots of time interviewing Oracle developers.
Interviewing was time consuming and we had a fairly rapid turnover of
people with varying technical abilities and personality disorders.</p>

<p>After a while, we decided to set a short technical test in an effort to
save time and improve the quality of the technical people we hired.</p>

<p>The test was a trivial piece of PL/SQL. Count all the rows in all the
tables in a specified schema. The consequences of introducing of this
test were very revealing.</p>

<p>Some candidates (with years of Oracle and PL/SQL experience) flatly
refused to take the test at all - &#8216;the agent didn&#8217;t say anything about a
technical test&#8217;.? Some candidates asked if they could have access to our
embryonic Oracle technical library (a couple of O&#8217;Reilly books). Some
candidates asked it they could use their own technical books for
reference. We flatly refused.</p>

<p>It was interesting to see whether people elected for Linux/vi or
Windows/notepad.</p>

<p>It was interesting to see whether people could deliver under pressure.</p>

<p>It was interesting to see whether people asked questions.</p>

<p>It was interesting to see whether people actually compiled and executed
the code. Some candidates thought, incorrectly, that the test was purely
to &#8216;write the code&#8217;.</p>

<p>It was interesting to see whether people visited
&#8216;http://tahiti.oracle.com/&#8217;. We said you couldn&#8217;t use books. However, we
didn&#8217;t say you couldn&#8217;t use the internet.</p>

<p>It was interesting to see whether people commented a trivial procedure.</p>

<p>It was interesting to see whether people counted the rows or checked for
the presence of recent statistics first.</p>

<p>It was interesting to see whether people used native, dynamic SQL or
tortured themselves with DBMS_SQL.</p>

<p>It was interesting to see whether people favoured SQL*Plus, Pro*C,
PL/SQL or Perl/DBI.</p>

<p>The standard of candidates improved. If the technical test was
unsatisfactory, we skipped the interview formalities to save time
(theirs and ours).</p>

<p>One outstanding candidate delivered an excellent test. Perfect,
commented PL/SQL. He even included a file header with CVS macros for
version control. The results were correct. He finished the assigned task
in minutes. He even used the singular if a table had &#8216;1 row&#8217;. He was an
excellent Oracle PL/SQL developer.</p>

<p>However, we didn&#8217;t hire him because there was an indefinable, intangible
concern, a nagging worry that we couldn&#8217;t articulate or put our finger
on precisely. It just didn&#8217;t feel right. Hard to explain to the agent.
Even harder to explain to him but sometimes you have to go with your
instincts.</p>
