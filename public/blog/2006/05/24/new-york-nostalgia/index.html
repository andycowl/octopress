<div class="entry-content"><p>Back in 1995, I was a software engineer for Ingres, working on the OS/2
port. A merchant bank had a serious, intermittent, non-reproducible
problem and Computer Associates kindly bought me a ticket to New York to
go and help them.</p>

<p>The ticket was an open return. I thought &#8216;That&#8217;s nice. That&#8217;s so I can
extend my stay for a lovely weekend city break with my wife&#8217;. The truth
was that it was an open return as I was staying onsite until the problem
was resolved [ PH was right. I am naive ]</p>

<p>I duly took a black briefcase with a magnetic tape with the complete
source code, an umbrella and a bowler hat. The tape was slightly too big
for the briefcase and it was a struggle to shut it. Halfway through the
flight, I decided to read some of the background to the long standing
issue. The briefcase wouldn&#8217;t open. It was jammed. I was petrified that
US Customs were going to ask me to open it. Thankfully, they didn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>When I arrived at the plush offices of the prestigious merchant bank, I
was greeted like royalty. The client was very impressed that an
&#8216;engineer all the way from London&#8217; had come to visit them. They offered
me tea, coffee or water and looked perplexed when I said &#8216;Err - have you
got a Swiss Army Knife ?&#8217;. A suitable tool was produced and they looked
on in amazement as I butchered the lock and held the mag tape aloft.
Come to think of it, I didn&#8217;t have a laptop so I must have compiled the
Ingres product on their server.</p>

<p>My other memories of this trip are going to a cinema in Times Square to
watch &#8216;Pulp Fiction&#8217; in an effort to stay awake and beat jet lag.
Somehow, this seemed to enhance the cinematic experience further.</p>

<p>Then I called home, trying to find out the United score against Crystal
Palace. People kept telling me &#8216;Oh you haven&#8217;t heard about Cantona. God
it was absolutely unbelievable. He was sent off, leapt into the crowd
and attacked a Palace fan with a Kung Fu kick&#8217;. I didn&#8217;t believe a word
of it and never got to find out the actual score (1-1) until I returned
home.</p>

<p>And the actual bug - it was a one liner. A race condition introduced by
a misplaced #ifdef.</p>
