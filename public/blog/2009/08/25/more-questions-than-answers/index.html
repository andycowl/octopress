<div class="entry-content"><p>Most of the Australians I met on my recent holiday were brilliant
people; friendly, welcoming, great company and most possessed a very
British style sense of humour.</p>

<p>However, there was one element of my Australian experience that was
slightly irritating; the tendency for people to ask questions. For
example, if you ever purchased goods in a shop using a card, you were
immediately greeted with &#8216;Credit or savings ?&#8217;</p>

<p>Another fine example was the following exchange one early morning at
Brisbane airport where I attempted the seemingly simply task of
purchasing four hot drinks as we waited for a short flight to Hamilton
Island.</p>

<p>&#8216;Good morning - Aaaahhh yaaah gaawwnn ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Good morning. Well, we&#8217;re going to Hamilton Island for three days. It
should be fantastic.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Naah - I said &#8216;How are you going ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;We&#8217;re flying - how do you think we&#8217;re getting there - kayaking ? Plus,
we&#8217;re in an airport. That&#8217;s a rather obvious clue.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No worries. What can I git yer ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;A tea, a coffee and two hot chocolates, please.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What sort of tea ?</p>

<p>&#8216;Err - what have you got ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Green Tea, Liptons Tea, Earl Grey, Camomile Tea, English Breakfast,
Iced Tea, Ass&#8230;&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;English Breakfast would be great. Thanks.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What size tea ?&#8217;</p>

<p>What sizes are there ?</p>

<p>&#8216;Small, regular, large.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;OK - small please. Thanks.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What else did you want ?&#8217;</p>

<p>A coffee and two hot chocolates, please.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What sort of coffee ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What have you got ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Flat white, latte, mocha, frapp&#8230;&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh Latte, please.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What size latte ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Small, please.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What else did you say again ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Just two hot chocolates please, Two small hot chocolates, please.
That&#8217;s all thanks.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Do you want sprinkles ?&#8217;</p>

<p>Now this question threw me a little. I looked back towards where the
family were sitting at Gate 3. I saw much tapping of fingers, much
looking at watches and much feigning of dying of thirst.</p>

<p>Inevitably, Norma was busy doing what she does best whenever she is
located in an airport - busy reviewing the shopping facilities ready to
conquer the world with her very own, embryonic &#8216;Worldwide airport
shopping and duty free outlets&#8217; blog.</p>

<p>Worse, one of the people who had requested a hot chocolate was also
doing what she does best whenever she is located in an airport terminal
- busy reviewing the toilet facilities ready to conquer the world with
her very own &#8216;People who have visited the toilets at Brisbane airport
(domestic terminal just outside gate 7)&#8217; group on Facebook.</p>

<p>Now I had to think quickly, very quickly. People behind me were sighing
and saying &#8216;Ah, mate, just get a bloody move on , will ya ?&#8217; in a very
un-British way.</p>

<p>I gestured frantically to Norman Junior III, sprinkling fictious
sprinkles over a fictitious hot chocolate drink and raising my thumb up,
smiling then turning my thumb down, frowning.</p>

<p>He looked rather quizzically and mouthed &#8216;She&#8217;s in the shop&#8217;. I
re-doubled my efforts and repeated my sprkinkling gestures.</p>

<p>He looked rather quizzically and mouthed &#8216;She&#8217;s in the toilet.&#8217;</p>

<p>I gave up my charades, ignored the laughter behind me and turned back to
the assistant.</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes please. Sprinkles on both.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Marshmallows ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Sorry ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Marshmallows ? Do you want marshallows on the hot chocolates ?&#8217;</p>

<p>By now, I was feeling I was the victim of some cruel joke and an Aussie
version of Jeremy Beadle was going to jump out clutching a microphone.
Either that or I was taking part in the Two Ronnies&#8217; legendary &#8216;Fork
Candles&#8217; sketch.</p>

<p>This endless interrogation was getting ridiculous but I resumed my mime
act and frantically tried to get a response from Norman Junior III.</p>

<p>I decided to re-enact the famous scene from Ghostbusters where
Marshmallow man strides all over the New York skyscrapers but he just
looked quizzically and mouthed &#8216;Can I have a muffin ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes please. Marshmallows on both hot chocolates.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Is that all, mate ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Would you like me to go over your order ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Well, no - I&#8217;d rather you got on and dispensed the drinks as my flight
will be boarding soon&#8217; but I contented myself with &#8216;Yes, please.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;So, you want small latte, small English Breakfast, two small hot
chocolates with sprinkles and marshmallows ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes, yes - that&#8217;s correct. Thanks.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Can I get anything else for you today ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No thanks. That&#8217;s all.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;And how are you going to be paying today ?&#8217;</p>

<p>I briefly about offering plastic but quickly find $20 to avoid the
inevitable &#8216;Cheque or savings&#8217; interrogation.</p>

<p>Finally, the torture is over. I wait in the line for five minutes and
the drinks are finally served. I grab the drinks and am looking around
for a plastic stirrer.</p>

<p>&#8216;Are you the guy who asked for &#8216;Small&#8217; ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Err, yes.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Didn&#8217;t you realise we don&#8217;t do &#8216;Small&#8217; any more - since July 25th, in
fact ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Err, no - I just ordered four hot drinks.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yeah, well Eileen should have told ya. It&#8217;s Regular or Large now. Only.
No Small any more.&#8217;</p>

<p>By now, I&#8217;d had enough. I decided to turn the tables.</p>

<p>&#8216;Have you got a tray, please ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Listen, I&#8217;ve given you four Regulars but I&#8217;ve only charged you for four
Smalls.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh - that really is most kind. How can I ever thank you enough ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Full sized tray or cardboard holder ?&#8217;</p>
