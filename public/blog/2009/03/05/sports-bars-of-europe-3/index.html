<div class="entry-content"><p>The latest update in this occasional and very
<a href="http://nbrightside.com/blog/2006/01/13/sports-bars-of-europe">popular</a>
<a href="http://nbrightside.com/blog/2006/04/26/sports-bars-of-europe-2">series</a>.</p>

<p>I am currently working in the delightful city of Bern, near Switzerland.
I have been here a couple of times before and last April I watched
United beat Barcelona 1-0 in the Champions League semi-final thanks to a
great goal from <a href="http://nbrightside.com/blog/2007/05/02/open-letter-to-paul-scholes">Paul
Scholes</a>.
Unusually for me, I watched that game with a colleague. Unfortunately
for him, I don&#8217;t think I was very good company. Well, I mean - who
really wants to discuss whether &#8216;late delivery of the extracts pose a
serious risk to the success of the project&#8217; when you&#8217;re watching your
team play in the crucial second leg of the European Cup semi-final.</p>

<p>Anyway, last night I returned to the same haunt to see United take on
the Barcodes at St James&#8217; Park. The venue for the night&#8217;s entertainment
was <a href="http://www.pickwick.ch/bern/index.php">Mr. Pickwick</a> which is a
sports bar with the obligatory football scarves and photographs adorning
the walls, serving English beer (London Pride) and Guinness with three
large TV screens.</p>

<p>I wasn&#8217;t entirely confident that the United game would be televised as I
knew it wasn&#8217;t being shown by Sky or Setanta back in dear ol&#8217; Blighty.
As I enter the hostelry, it doesn&#8217;t look too promising; football is
being shown but, alas, the TV&#8217;s are only showing &#8216;Young Boys of Bern&#8217;
and highlights from the German Bundesliga.</p>

<p>I confidently order my customary pint of &#8216;Feldschlosschen&#8217; and enquire
if there&#8217;s any chance the United game will be on. The helpful gentleman
behind the bar tells me &#8216;Oh yes - Manchester will be on at 9 o&#8217;clock&#8217;.
He then rather unhelpfully short-changes me by 10CHF which I
successfully challenge.</p>

<p>OK - so it&#8217;s 19:43, the match kicks off at 19:45 and we&#8217;re going to get
the United game in 15 minutes. So I grab a barstool and nervously kill
time, watching &#8216;Young Boys of Bern&#8217; play in front of a very meagre crowd
(10, 758)</p>

<p>For some reason, I find the &#8217;<a href="http://www.bscyb.ch/yb-index.htm">Young Boys of
Bern</a>&#8217; a very amusing name for a
football club. It is also fitting and somehow appropriate that the
&#8216;Young Boys&#8217; play their home fixtures at the &#8216;Wankdorf Stadium&#8217;.</p>

<p>If United hadn&#8217;t been playing tonight, I might have actually gone to see
the game as I have now mastered the (very efficient) public transport
system in Bern. However, the prospect of getting lost and asking a local
&#8216;Where can I find Young Boys, please ?&#8217; was not an attractive one.</p>

<p>At 9 o&#8217;clock, multiple remote controllers appear from behind the bar, TV
channels are switched and we all play musical chairs as we jostle for a
decent viewing position for our chosen match.</p>

<p>To my horror, I see that United are losing 1-0 to Newcastle after
Chelsea and Liverpool both won the previous night. I console myself by
ordering another beer. Ten minutes later, normal service is restored
when John O&#8217;Shea rampages forward (shurely shome mistake here - Ed) and
crosses for Rooney who turns sharply to equalise.</p>

<p>I spot the Newcastle owner, Mike Ashley, sitting in the stand. This must
be his first visit to St James&#8217; Park since he sacked Keegan and necked
that pint in 12 seconds flat for the TV cameras. I sincerely hope the
loud United following greet him with the traditional &#8216;Come to see
United, you&#8217;ve only come to see United&#8217;.</p>

<p>Half-time arrives and, much to my surprise, I see Edwin van der Sar drop
a clanger for Newcastle&#8217;s opening goal. Kind of ironic after his
brilliant, record breaking run of clean sheets.</p>

<p>Newcastle are playing pretty well but United are in control and always
look threatening. United take the lead when Park crosses to give the
classy Dimitar Berbatov a simple tap-in.</p>

<p>Over on an adjacent TV screen, &#8216;Young Boys&#8217; have triumphed 3-0 in a cup
quarter-final. 10 minutes later, supporters who have been to the game
drift in for the post-match analysis and a couple of drinks.</p>

<p>The YB fans are clad in club colours; Yellow and Black - hardly any of
them are &#8216;Young Boys&#8217;, more like &#8216;Middle Aged Men With Beards&#8217;. I am
forced to gawp at one man who comes in with a YB shirt adorned with the
unbelievable slogan &#8216;Young Boys Forever&#8217;. A brave man. I truly hope for
his sake, YB never qualify for Europe and he travels to the away leg in
England.</p>

<p>Better still, imagine if BSCYB were to meet Chelsea in the UEFA Cup next
season. Then we would have the dream fixture - &#8216;Rent Boys&#8217; versus &#8216;Young
Boys&#8217; !</p>

<p>Next fixture: MUFC versus Milan, Wednesday 11 Match. Location: Madrid.</p>
