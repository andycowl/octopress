<div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s fair to say it took me a while to fully &#8216;get&#8217; microblogging. In
fact, initially Twitter left me as
<a href="http://nbrightside.com/blog/2007/03/12/resisting-the-lure-of-twitter">cold</a>
as a corpse in a deep freeze.</p>

<p>Inevitably, things change and like an old woman, I reserve the right to
change my mind more frequently than my underpants, and in 2008, I
started using Twitter to post a continuous bytestream of <a href="http://nbrightside.com/blog/2008/04/29/brief-history-of-inane-drivel">inane
drivel</a>
in less than 140 characters.</p>

<p>Last July, when <a href="http://identi.ca/">identi.ca</a> launched, I immediately
signed up for the open source microblogging service. I even built my own
Laconi.ca <a href="http://nbrightside.com/laconica/">instance</a> - not necessarily
because I intended using it but just to see how easy (or hard) it was to
install and configure the software.</p>

<p>As a controlled experiment, I set myself the task of participating fully
on identi.ca to see how long it would take me to acquire <a href="http://nbrightside.com/blog/2008/07/16/how-to-make-100-friends-on-identi-ca-in-14-days">100
friends</a>
on identi.ca. The answer, surprisingly, was 14 days.</p>

<p>Since then I have really enjoyed the sense of community on identi.ca, I
have met lots of interesting people and enjoy the technically oriented
focus of the folk over there. identi.ca isn&#8217;t Twitter and the majority
of my
&#8217;<a href="http://nbrightside.com/blog/2008/08/19/knowing-me-knowing-you">friends</a>&#8217;
steadfastly continue to use Twitter. This is understandable - Twitter
gets all the media coverage. Twitter is where most people live and
freedom is all about the freedom of choice.</p>

<p>I have continued to be a keen user and advocate of the identi.ca service
as I think it offers several
<a href="http://andyc.tumblr.com/post/72328374/twitter-versus-identi-ca">advantages</a>
over Twitter and it has genuinely made me consider the role of open
source software versus proprietary systems with lock-in and closed data
silos.</p>

<p>identi.ca has continued to be actively developed and it&#8217;s exciting to
follow developments and build each new version as it is released. Evan
Prodromou and the identi.ca team actively participate on identi.ca and
are genuinely responsive to honest, constructive feedback from users.</p>

<p>However, this week has seen a couple of developments that have sowed the
first seeds of doubt about the future of identi.ca (not Laconi.ca) and
raise a nagging concern.</p>

<p>The
<a href="http://controlyourself.ca/2009/03/30/statusnet-coming-soon/">announcement</a>
of a hosted, off the shelf microblogging service -
<a href="http://status.net/">status.net</a>
with premium features costing undisclosed amounts of money.
Obviously, Evan (and the identi.ca team) can&#8217;t exist and feed their
families on the many plaudits, thanks and congratulations of 60,000
identi.ca users and he was always going to have to monetize the service
to pay his mortgage. However, the provision of a paid for service with
premium features raises a few issues. In all the congratulatory
coverage, sensible, intelligent people seem to have conveniently
overlooked this particular &#8216;elephant in the room&#8217;.</p>

<p>There is an obvious potential conflict of interest. If Microsoft are
paying $50,000 for a hosted microblog and demand tight integration with
Outlook which Evan fundamentally disagrees with, will he yield ? Will
the development of other OpenMicroBlogging (OMB) functionality be
delayed due to the demands of paying customers (large or small) on
status.net ?</p>

<p>Obviously, identi.ca is built on Laconi.ca which is Open Source so
anyone is free to fork the code and develop the software independently
from Evan. For example, I could theoretically extract all my data from
identi.ca, import it into my own Laconica instance and microblog away in
the federation of Laconi.ca instances until my heart&#8217;s content.</p>

<p>Today, we get another far more worrying piece of news - identi.ca
obviously have more funding than I thought. My worries about Evan and
his family living in a Montreal hostel, eating beans on toast and
children with no shoes were clearly ill-founded.
Identi.ca have announced the
<a href="http://controlyourself.ca/2009/04/01/identica-acquires-twitter/">acquisition</a>
of Twitter.com with the following immediate results:</p>

<ul>
<li>identi.ca now has a Twitter like theme - urgh !</li>
<li>We are already starting to see the inevitable influx of Twitter
celebrities (Britney Spears, Barack Obama, Guy Kawasaki, Guy
Cashmore, Jonathan Ross).</li>
<li>The &#8217;<a href="http://identi.ca/featured">Featured</a>&#8217; tab on identi.ca used to
feature interesting individuals and long standing identi.ca
advocates. Now it is consumed with Twitterati.</li>
<li>It can only be a matter of time before the spammers follow</li>
</ul>


<p>This reverse takeover of Twitter is rather like applauding The Clash&#8217;s
resolute refusal to play of Top of The Pops and then turning on your
telly to see the band performing &#8216;White Man in Hammersmith Palais&#8217; with
Tony Blackburn as your smiling host.</p>

<p>To use another musical analogy, do you remember the very last song on
the very last tour by the Sex Pistols in America and immortalised in the
film &#8216;Great Rock&#8217;n&#8217;Roll Swindle&#8217; ? After the last song, John Lydon
squats down on his haunches and sneers at the audience.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;Do you ever feel like you&#8217;ve been cheated ?&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>Well, Evan, yes - I do.</p>
