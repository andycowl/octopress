<div class="entry-content"><p>A few years ago, on a Wednesday night, I returned from work and Norma
told me in passing that she had got a man coming to clean our carpets
for free.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later, I found myself welcoming not one but two Kirby
salesmen into my house. What followed was possibly the worst 96 minutes
of my life (with the possible exception of yesterday&#8217;s fixture at
Anfield).</p>

<p>I am normally polite and well mannered so I dutifully sat with my cup of
tea and listened to the sales guy&#8217;s pitch about the miscellaneous
wonders of the Kirby vacuum cleaner.</p>

<p>After a while of professional, polished and non-stop patter, I
interjected and tried to ask &#8216;OK - this sounds great but how much is it
?&#8217; in an effort to curtail proceedings but was ignored.</p>

<p>I waited patiently as he assembled various attachments for dog hair,
vacuuming the inside of the car and accessing the hard to reach areas
behind radiators.</p>

<p>I got slightly more irritated as Norma excused herself to make tea for
the kids and the senior salesman passed over to the junior apprentice
for phase 2.</p>

<p>I cursed silently as Norma returned and asked &#8216;Listen - you&#8217;ve been here
25 minutes now. When are you going to hoover my carpets for me ?&#8217;.
Without pausing for breath, senior sales guy triumphantly plugged in the
vacuum cleaner, and proceeded to clean and re-clean a 4 inch square of
my lounge carpet. He then instructed his stooge to dump the contents
onto a white cloth and invited us both to examine the contents in minute
detail.</p>

<p>It was dust. Not that fascinating.</p>

<p>Again, I interjected with &#8216;Listen - I&#8217;m really not interest-&#8217; but was
interrupted with &#8216;OK - now we will hoover your bed for you. Please bring
your current hoover upstairs&#8217;. To my horror, Norma led them upstairs
where they apparently lifted up a duvet and vacuumed the mattress of my
6 year old daughter. Twice.</p>

<p>Two more pristine white cloths was brought out and we poured over the
skin debris that a human leaves behind on the sheets when asleep. We
compared and contrasted the superlative results of the Kirby which has
lifted much more dirt than our Panasonic hoover.</p>

<p>Norma, feeling incredibly guilty and no doubt a little embarrassed, now
started to assert herself and politely asked the salesmen to leave as it
was now the kids&#8217; bedtime.</p>

<p>Still, the two sales guys persisted as, after what seemed like hours, we
entered the home straight and the the closing of the deal. Finally, we
got to a price. It was a lot - I think it was over &pound;2,000 which almost
made me spill my now cold cup of tea. I countered with &#8216;Come on, I can
get a Panasonic for &pound;200 from Comet&#8217; and the sales guy immediately
replied with his &#8216;Objection-Retort&#8217; from the school of pressure selling
about the benefits of the Kirby and its lifetime guarantee.</p>

<p>My wife left the room. I could tell she was now quite upset at the
imposition of having these chaps in our house, interrupting our routine.
People who upset my wife (with one honourable exception - me) tend to
upset me so I now got slightly more forceful.</p>

<p>&#8216;Listen, chaps. I realise my wife invited you here this evening but she
thought she was getting her carpets cleaned for free not a gentle,
prolonged, high pressure sales pitch. We&#8217;ve got a hoover. We&#8217;re not
looking to buy a hoover and we certainly would never contemplate a Kirby
hoover that cost over &pound;2,000.&#8217;</p>

<p>Senior salesman piped up with &#8216;Ah but that&#8217;s the good news Mr.
Brightside - if you commit tonight, I can offer you a 40% discount.&#8217;</p>

<p>I sighed inwardly and stared at the mantelpiece. I was transfixed. I
stared again at the clock on the mantelpiece. The time was 7:41pm on a
Wednesday night.</p>

<p>I stood up, folded up the white cloth, put the assorted attachments back
into the box and handed it to the junior apprentice.</p>

<p>&#8216;Listen lads. I realise you&#8217;re only doing your job but my wife has
politely asked you to leave. I have also politely asked you to get out
of my house but United are playing in Lyon and the game kicks off in 4
minutes so now I telling you to get your fucking stuff together and
leave. Now.&#8217;</p>

<p>Senior sales guy could now (finally) see the writing on the wall and
started moaning about how we&#8217;d wasted their time - a little ironic as I
viewed it as them wasting our time - and started to protest and call me
rude names.</p>

<p>I ignored him, turned the TV on, picked up his box of tricks and his
catalogues and ushered them both to the door.</p>
