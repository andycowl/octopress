<div class="entry-content"><p>[Obligatory hat tip to &#8217;<a href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/deploy/availability/pdf/defrag.pdf">How to stop defragmenting and start
living</a>&#8217;.
As an aside, if you&#8217;re an Oracle DBA and haven&#8217;t read this whitepaper,
please do so. Now.]</p>

<p>I have used various devices and software over my 76 years on this planet
to listen to music:</p>

<ul>
<li>Record player</li>
<li>Cassette player</li>
<li>Transistor radio</li>
<li>Ears</li>
<li>WinAmp</li>
<li><a href="http://nbrightside.com/blog/2006/05/02/sonicstage-34-released">SonicStage</a></li>
<li>Windows Media Player</li>
</ul>


<p>18 months ago, I finally caved in and bought an iTouch which I use a
lot; mainly for listening to music
and<a href="http://nbrightside.com/blog/2008/09/21/top-of-the-podcasts">podcasts</a>
at airports.</p>

<p>I duly downloaded iTunes in order to get my music library onto the
iTouch. I seem to remember that iTunes couldn&#8217;t play Windows Media
Player files which was slightly irritating. In any case, with a sense of
a new beginning and a fresh, clean start, I re-ripped all my music CD&#8217;s
into Apple&#8217;s AAC format, added the missing album artwork and
synchronised my music, photos and applications to the iTouch.</p>

<p>Over the last 18 months, Apple proceeded to add more and more &#8216;features&#8217;
to iTunes which I don&#8217;t want or need:</p>

<ul>
<li>Tighter integration with the iTunes store</li>
<li>Genius - some sort of recommendation engine closely linked to the
above</li>
<li>Jukebox</li>
<li>A default assumption that I also wanted to install additional
software packages: QuickTime, Safari and Mobile Me.</li>
</ul>


<p>When Apple recently released iTunes 9, I suddenly realised I was
downloading 98.4MB - just to play music.</p>

<p>It slowly dawned on me that, whenever I started iTunes, my (admittedly
aging PC) was unusable for 40 seconds while iTunes initialised and CPU
usage hit the roof.</p>

<p>I also realised that iTunes consumed a staggering 82MB of physical
memory while playing a tune and this excessive memory consumption could
increase to 134MB after connecting to the iTunes store.</p>

<p>I realised this was madness. Complete madness. Finally, I came to my
senses and sought out alternative programs to replace the oversized,
obese, bloated, multi-function and very slow iTunes.</p>

<p>I soon discovered <a href="http://www.foobar2000.org/">Foobar 2000</a> which is a
small, compact, lighweight audio player for Windows. I downloaded the
program and was immediately struck by the size of the Foobar2000
distribution - 2,985KB, 2.81MB or 3,056,036 bytes to be precise.</p>

<p>This was already promising so I installed the program. I was pleasantly
surprised that Foobar quickly imported my existing iTunes music library
in its entirety and I was immediately able to play AAC encoded music. No
need for additional plugins or codecs.</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.co.uk/lh/photo/j72CrvPfYSct0Vvix_8YvQ?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_l2uGy1RGCiE/StCL0v3-FlI/AAAAAAAABds/UmLwc6xn4aE/s400/Foobar01-DefaultPlayer.PNG" alt="image" /></a>
I was also pleasantly surprised to see Foobar 2000 start up
instantaneously (no delay or hourglass here) and consume a slightly more
reeasonable 25,888KB of memory.</p>

<p>However, all of this was redundant unless I could actually synchronise
music to the iTouch as using two completely separate programs to mange
my music was self-defeating. So I downloaded a Foobar extension
promisingly named &#8217;<a href="http://www.foobar2000.org/components/view/foo_dop">Ipod
Manager</a>&#8217; and
configured it.</p>

<p>For a complete fresh start, I took the rather brave (or stupid) move of
completely resetting the iTouch to the factory settings which deleted
all data and promptly hit &#8216;Sync&#8217; in Foobar.</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.co.uk/lh/photo/Nsg7rXG60ipEpz_LO4KK5Q?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_l2uGy1RGCiE/StCL01_lS1I/AAAAAAAABdw/4OL34SwFBtI/s400/Foobar02-iPodSync.PNG" alt="image" /></a>
Although it took a while, synchronisation was 100% successful and I even
got a &#8216;Preview&#8217; of what songs were going to added/removed from the
iTouch. This feature was incredibly useful as it gives you a chance to
abort if your entire music library is going to be (unexpectedly)
deleted.</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.co.uk/lh/photo/zutHo7-S2NN2Sj52E3RFEQ?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_l2uGy1RGCiE/StCL0xy2G5I/AAAAAAAABd0/hyx_dKTSFYU/s400/Foobar03-SyncPreview.PNG" alt="image" /></a>
There were some minor issues - not all album covers were displayed on
the iTouch. I discovered that iTunes embeds album artwork in the AAC
file. I preferred Foobar&#8217;s method of adding the album art to the folder
as &#8216;Cover.jpg&#8217; so you have complete control over the images used. Later
on, I actually removed the embedded artwork completely.</p>

<p>What else was missing ? I previously used iTunes to manage podcasts
although this was never really satisfactory as iTunes had a weird
concept of when the status of a podcast should be modified to
&#8216;Listened&#8217;. I rather thought listening from start to finish would
qualify but Apple obviously disagreed and repeatedly kept sync&#8217;ing old
content onto the iTouch.</p>

<p>Foobar had another useful extension called
&#8217;<a href="http://pelit.koillismaa.fi/plugins/show.php?id=270">PodCatcher</a>&#8217; which
worked brilliantly. It would automatically download new podcasts (in the
background) and I was able to easily sync to the iTouch simply by
including the new &#8216;Podcasts&#8217; category to the synchronisation list.</p>

<p>I wasn&#8217;t completely happy with the default UI of Foobar so I used the
<a href="http://www.foobar2000.org/components/view/foo_ui_columns">Columns UI</a>
extension to make it look slightly more usable with the album artwork
displayed.</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.co.uk/lh/photo/81HGcOdc-2A2KrJcSubnaw?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_l2uGy1RGCiE/StCL08HOoNI/AAAAAAAABd4/YRGEden4K4g/s400/Foobar04-ColumnsUI.PNG" alt="image" /></a>
Foobar 2000 really is the complete music player - once you add the
appropriate encoders, it can play virtually music in any format (FLAC,
WMA, AAC, WavPack, Ogg Vorbis et al).</p>

<p>One great feature is that Foobar can perform conversion between the
various formats. If I can summon up the energy to re-rip all my CD&#8217;s yet
again, I plan to rip all my music to a lossless format (FLAC) and Foobar
would dynamically convert to the required lossy, compressed format
during the sync to the iTouch.</p>

<p>Another couple of useful extensions for Foobar:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.foobar2000.org/components/view/foo_audioscrobbler">Audioscrobbler</a>

<ul>
<li>to upload my played songs (including those on iTouch) to
<a href="http://www.last.fm/user/andycowl">last.fm</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="http://www.foobar2000.org/components/view/foo_playcount">Playback
statistics</a>

<ul>
<li>generates &#8216;Recently Played&#8217; playlist.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>Although I am now blissfully almost iTunes free, I still need to use
iTunes to update the software on the iTouch but I am delighted to say
that is the sole extent of my iTunes usage. If I need to install any
applications on the iTouch, I can do that directly from the iTouch.</p>

<p>It was particularly satisfying to copy my Foobar configuration and music
library to my work laptop and completely remove iTunes from that
computer.</p>
