  <div class="entry-content"><p>I admire Wayne Rooney&#8217;s skills as a footballer and I honestly don&#8217;t give
a flying fig about his sordid, personal life. Unfortunately, I don&#8217;t
think Wayne Rooney is blessed with that much intelligence. This isn&#8217;t a
criticism, merely a statement of fact.</p>

<p>If Alex Ferguson says the sky is green, then the sky is green. If Alex
Ferguson says you have an <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/man_utd/9090179.stm">ankle injury</a>, then you have an ankle
injury.</p>

<p>Sadly, for Rooney and Manchester United, I sense the writing might now
be indelibly marked on the wall for his career at Manchester United.</p>

<p>Rooney should just ask Beckham, Keane, Stam and van Nistelrooy.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of my favourite and regular UK bloggers, Jonathan Beckett had gone
rather quiet recently so I assumed he must have moved blogging platform
the the Nth time, gone on holiday or possibly his feed was screwed
without his knowledge so I sent him a polite email asking ‘Dead or just
resting ?&#8217; and he <a href="http://jonbeckett.wordpress.com/2010/10/12/mediocrity-rules/">informed</a> me he&#8217;d intentionally changed blog
address without telling anyone.</p>

<p>I think this sudden, unannounced, abrupt loss of service is an excellent
idea for all bloggers - it&#8217;s a bit like writing ‘I love small, fresh,
juicy satsumas&#8217; buried deep in the middle of a technical report to be
delivered to a client or pausing for 5 minutes, with your face in your
hands, during a presentation at Oracle Open World. It helps to focus the
mind and check whether anyone is actually reading or listening.</p>

<p>In fact, this method of social network suicide followed by starting
again from zero and organic gardening is a strategy I have used more
than once during my blogging lifetime. The only difference is my stats
genuinely reverted to zero but I wasn&#8217;t innundated with curious Tweets,
scribblings on my Facebook walll, IM&#8217;s and concerned email messages
enquiring about my state of mind and asking for details of the new blog
feed.</p>

<p>I was greeted a wall of silence, pierced only by a solitary email: ‘I
simply adore Clementines&#8217;.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Apart from a short-lived <a href="http://nbrightside.com/blog/2010/06/23/turbulence-ahead">crisis of confidence</a> - after losing a Draft
post, I spontaneously migrated this blog to Wordpress as an interim hop
before completing 99% of a full blown migration to <a href="http://blog.montylounge.com/2009/07/1/welcome/">Django-Mingus</a>
which I then immediately discarded - I have used <a href="http://habariproject.org/en/">Habari</a> as my
preferred blogging platform for two and a half years.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s been a while since the last major Habari release (0.6) but, because
I run the latest 0.7 development code (using SubVersion), the lengthy
gap and absence of a formal 0.7 release didn&#8217;t particularly bother me.</p>

<p>However, the 0.6.4 release is pretty dated now and lots of new features
have been added and bugs fixed in the intervening 18 months. Also, I
think there are potential developers who are keen to get the latest and
greatest version of Habari so I was pleased to see that the Habari
project released a &#8217;<a href="http://habariproject.org/en/habari-07-developer-preview-1">0.7 Developer Release</a>&#8217; yesterday.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Occasionally, I have posted stuff on Posterous and Tumblr because I
didn&#8217;t really feel it ‘belonged&#8217; on this blog, it wasn&#8217;t worthy or it
was a throwaway one-liner and not a proper blog post. As I subsequently
deleted my Posterous account (as I didn&#8217;t like their <a href="http://www.blogherald.com/2010/06/24/posterous-slanders-tumblr/">negative

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This morning, a gentleman was reading a copy of The Times on my South
West Trains service bound for London Waterloo. Nothing too surprising
about that.</p>

<p>However, this man continued to intently consume the day&#8217;s important news
stories as he left the train and made his way down to the Underground
network.</p>

<p>This chap wasn&#8217;t reading a newspaper though. He was an early adopter so
he was reading the electronic version of The Times on an Apple iPad.
Clearly, the content is so captivating, the display is so sharp and the
font is so crystal clear that he simply has to continue reading the news
as he descends the staircase at platform 4, tightly packed in a mass of
humanity, down to the Waterloo and City line.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not a rabid Apple hater. I think Apple are an innovative design
company who have helped spark some much needed competition; particularly
into the mobile ‘device&#8217; market.</p>

<p>What irritates me though is the fact that this chap wasn&#8217;t using the
iPad like people use a newspaper. People don&#8217;t generally read a
newspaper as they descend a set of stairs. People generally don&#8217;t hold
a device costing over &pound;400 (although I suspect this chap
splashed out on the 3G/WiFi/64GB version which costs a staggering
&pound;750) out in front of them and nonchalantly pretend to to
fascinated at the content while navigating a set of steps and
simultaneously being jostled by rushing commuters from all directions.</p>

<p>This gentleman was doing this for one reason and one reason only -
fervently hoping and praying that someone, just anyone, would look at
him and his fancy tablet, maybe even ask him about it, exclaim ‘Wow !
Alan - look, that guy&#8217;s got an iPad !&#8217; or just surreptitiously try to
look over his shoulder to catch a glance of last night&#8217;s football
results.</p>

<p>Part of me was urging him to lose his footing, tumble forward down six
steps, falling flat on on his face, dropping his fancy, overpriced,
electronic gadget, shattering the screen in three places.</p>

<p>But unfortunately he didn&#8217;t. Despite me barging into him. Twice.</p>

<p>What a complete iPoser.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I believe it was Tommy Docherty who christened the phrase ‘the innocence
of youth&#8217; when he described the joyful, attacking football of the newly
promoted Manchester United team during the 1975–1976 season.</p>

<p>One of my favourite bloggers, <a href="http://cheeseandbeans.wordpress.com/">Jonathan Beckett</a>, also reminded me of
‘the innocence of youth&#8217; recently when he recounted how he dare not tell
one of his three daughters that the family was getting three new kittens
imminently lest she responded by ‘jumping up and down uncontrollably&#8217;.</p>

<p>When he was younger, my nephew was so overcome by nervous energy and
excitement at birthdays and Christmas, his body literally overheated.
Occasionally, his mother had to send him to his bedroom to lie down
quietly with a damp flannel covering his face. This made present
selection relatively easy though; we just bought him a flannelette
selection and a ice-pack.</p>

<p>This morning, I witnessed the glorious innocence of youth at first hand
when I saw two pretty young schoolgirls get on the train [where&#8217;s this
going ? - Ed] and then each girl shared one cord of a pair of earphones
to listen to music on, what I believe young people call, a portable MP3
player. The two girls immediately started smiling and one started
dancing on the spot.</p>

<p>I couldn&#8217;t help smiling myself as I looked across at the happy, carefree
faces of these two giggling girls.</p>

<p>Then we got to Wimbledon station where a group of silent, miserable,
soulless commuters boarded the train, pushing and shoving to claim their
rightful place, desperate to get on the 08:34, desperate to get to the
office for another day of mind numbing monotony.</p>

<p>The train was really quite full now but still more determined men and
women continued to force their way on, almost crushing the air and joy
out of these two slightly built girls who were gradually swamped and
seemed to disappear from view as the vast array of grown adults
surrounded them in a pincer movement.</p>

<p>The girls reacted by moving closer to each other and then one happened
to look up at a gentleman&#8217;s arm which extended over their heads to clasp
onto the pole. They looked at each other and promptly burst into another
fit of helpless giggles.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>‘When you land at Heathrow you think at times you have landed in a
Third World country&#8217; - Cardinal Walter Kasper.</p></blockquote>

<p>I guess the Papal entrourage must have landed at Terminal 3 and endured
the inevitable 20 minute wait for a bus to be brought up to the
aircraft. If only the Italian check-in staff had put those red
‘Priority&#8217; tags on their suitcases.</p>

<p>Still, it&#8217;s a bit rich coming from a man who wears a pointy hat and
attaches the same importance to the ordination of women as to the sexual
abuse of children by Catholic priests.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The Brightside family holiday in Spain was a very relaxing affair. For a
period of 10 days, I didn&#8217;t watch a television, read a newspaper, stare
at a computer screen or even turn my mobile phone on.</p>

<p>In fact, I sat by the pool, listened to music, swam, ate fantastic
seafood, thought a lot and ploughed my way through the Millennium
trilogy by Stieg Larsson.</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.co.uk/lh/photo/fYXZfK5ABbL1eHCIngPp2g?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_l2uGy1RGCiE/TIdiF80AvLI/AAAAAAAABn0/b4PtHcYd1Y0/s400/DSC00370.JPG" /></a></p>

<p>One hot, sunny afternoon, my relaxation was disturbed by the most
awful, horrible, blood curdling screams. I consulted my iTouch; &#8216;D-7&#8217;
by that popular 90&#8217;s beat combo - Nirvana. Ah that explains it. I
returned to &#8216;The Girl Who Played With Fire&#8217; and the exciting
adventures of Lisbeth Salander.</p>

<p>Almost immediately, my train of thought was interrupted by yet more
loud, agonising, terrifying animalistic screams. I looked across at
Norma who was embracing the Spanish culture with a short mid-afternoon
siesta so it definitely wasn&#8217;t her.</p>

<p>I consulted the iTouch again as the blood curdling screaming continued
unabated. Ah - &#8216;Welcome to the Atrocity Exhibition&#8217; by the popular
80&#8217;s beat combo - Joy Division from the &#8216;Live at the Paradiso&#8217; bootleg
(available from all good Torrent sites).</p>

<p>I reduced the volume by a notch and was about to summon up the energy to
adjust the parasol to get some shade.</p>

<p>Suddenly, away to my right, I saw a flash of green as my radiant wife,
Norma, suddenly and spontaneously leapt from her sun-lounger. That&#8217;s
strange I thought - Cocktail Happy Hour doesn&#8217;t start for another 40
minutes. I watched Norma as she ran at breakneck speed towards the
swimming pool.</p>

<p>I thought I&#8217;d be sociable so I turned my music off and went to join her
for some watery frolics followed by discussion of the very important
issue of the choice of venue for tonight&#8217;s meal.</p>

<p>I stood next to her at the edge of the swimming pool and suddenly my
brain went into overdrive. My iTouch was off and yet the loud, agonising
screams continued.</p>

<p>Wait - there was a middle aged man splashing about in the water. Wait -
is he in difficulty ? Wait - he can&#8217;t be - this pool is 1.80m at its
deepest. I can stand up in the pool everywhere apart from 2 square
metres where I have to stand on tip-toes. Wait - he&#8217;s shorter than me.
Wait - what the heck is going on here ?</p>

<p>As my brain struggled to parse the situation in front of me, Norma
spontaneously and spectacularly leapt into the swimming pool.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a horrible, hackneyed cliche but it was like watching life in
slow motion. The middle aged man was still thrashing about rather
frantically and he was making the most horrible noises. Loud,
prolonged, deep blood curdling noises. At first, I wondered if he was
a Joy Division or Nirvana fan and just singing &#8216;D-7&#8217; followed by
&#8216;Welcome to the Atrocity Exhibition&#8217; in his very own unique version of
underwater, punk karaoke.</p>

<p>Norma and another gentleman in the pool gradually moved towards drowning
man like two sharks closing in on their prey. But without the triangular
fins.</p>

<p>Finally, my brain woke up. This guy didn&#8217;t appear to be larking about.
There were no children with him. He genuinely looked like he was
flailing his arms around and panicking like, well, a drowning man. His
eyes were open and he was conscious and vertical but I wondered if he
was having a fit or an asthma or panic attack.</p>

<p>As I considered entering the water, Norma got closer to the drowning
man. I heard a voice behind me: &#8216;Can we go and get an ice-cream yet
Dad ? It&#8217;s nearly 4 o&#8217;clock.&#8217;</p>

<p>My daughter Norma Jeane was at my side carefully reviewing progress on
her sun tan and, incredibly was thinking about her stomach rather than
the drama unfolding in front of us. Even more incredibly, Norma Jeane is
a qualified life guard.</p>

<p>&#8216;Hang on Norma Jeane - your Mum&#8217;s a little busy at the moment saving a
drowning man.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh - shall I just get her a Magnum Classic then ? Have you got any
Euros ?&#8217;</p>

<p>Norma reached the flailing man and went to lift him. The man seized
his opportunity and pushed down hard on Norma&#8217;s shoulder to lift
himself out of the water and get some air into his lungs The laws of
physics meant that he immediately pushed Norma fully under the
water. Norman Jeane offered &#8216;Oh yeah - that&#8217;s a classic life saving
mistake. We did it on the course. You should always support the
drowning man low down before he has a chance to grab you and risk
drowning you.&#8217;</p>

<p>Thankfully, the man&#8217;s screams finally subsided and Norma and the other
man lifted the man, rather ungracefully, up onto the poolside - laid
out like a beached seal. The hotel pool man immaculately clad in white
shirt and white long trousers (like an extra from &#8216;An Officer and a
Gentleman&#8217;) ambled over. &#8216;Everything ees OK, si ?&#8217;</p>

<p>‘Burns - I guess this means I can book the hotel for four nights and
cancel the flights to OpenWorld then ?&#8217;</p>

<p>It was 10:30 am on a dull, grey overcast Monday morning in Manchester.
Sherlock Burns and Doctor Timothy Hall had just emerged from a
fractious, tense kick-off meeting at Tiger Telecom. Sherlock Burns and
Dr. Timothy Hall had been called by the IT director at short notice to
investigate a sudden and marked degradation in the performance of the
production database</p>

<p>‘No. On the contrary, Doctor Hall. Please ensure the Hackney carriage is
booked for 4pm together with two first class tickets for the return
train journey to Euston. I have every confidence this case will be
solved by lunchtime. This time tomorrow we will be on a plane to
California.&#8217;</p>

<p>‘But Burns - we just sat through a 90 minute meeting with no obvious
solution. Why, I do declare, the customer can&#8217;t even articulate the
problem clearly and all the project team are arguing with each other.
How on earth -&#8217;</p>

<p>‘Dr. Hall - do you recall the pretty chart showing the &#8216;Key Business
Transaction Response Times&#8217; ? What did you observe ?&#8217;</p>

<p>‘Err - I believe it was Excel 2007 and used a fancy pivot table…&#8217;</p>

<p>‘No, no - not that. Didn&#8217;t you look closely at the X-axis ? The timeline
of the monitoring process was every 10 minutes. After August 15th, the
granularity of the dots changed to every 10 seconds. This coincided with
the performance problems and undoubtedly means the frequency of the
monitoring probe was modified resulting in the increased load on the
system.&#8217;</p>

<p>‘Oh Burns - that truly is absolutely magnificent. How did you spot that
?&#8217;</p>

<p>‘Obvious Dr. Hall, blindingly obvious. I suspect you will find someone,
somewhere has got his asterisks mixed up when he editted the crontab. A
common failing when you try to convert Windows support staff to the
superior Unix platform. Now as we were brought through the office by our
host and walked through the call centre area, what did you notice ?&#8217;</p>

<p>‘Well Burns - I noticed a lot of pretty girls wearing headsets. That
blonde, in particular, was stunning -&#8217;</p>

<p>‘No, no - I&#8217;m talking about the plethora of &#8216;New Hire Induction Guide&#8217;
on their desks. Tiger Telecom has obviously hired all these people
recently which is also contributing more load to the system.&#8217;</p>

<p>‘No - Burns - that can&#8217;t be right. You specifcally asked them in the
meeting what had changed recently and they all insisted: &#8216;Nothing.
Absolutely nothing.&#8217;</p>

<p>‘That&#8217;s why we are here, Dr Hall. Unless you saw it with your own eyes
it didn&#8217;t happen. Another factor at play here is the Senior Oracle DBA.
He is incompetent and must be replaced immediately.&#8217;</p>

<p>‘Oh Burns - how can you say that ? He seemed like a lovely bloke to me
and don&#8217;t forget he bought us our Latte&#8217;s.&#8217;</p>

<p>‘Shut up Hall. What did you notice on his desk ?&#8217;</p>

<p>‘On his desk ? Well nothing apart from that rather amusing &#8216;You don&#8217;t
have to be mad to work here but it helps&#8217; postcard and a photo of his
wife sunbathing in Crete….&#8217;</p>

<p>‘No, no. I&#8217;m talking about the technical books on his desk. He had a
pile of Oracle books - all the usual suspects; Kyte, Lewis, Milsap and
Antognini. But on the very top of that pile was a curious tome - &#8216;Oracle
Tuning - The Definitive Reference Second Edition&#8217; by Donald Burleson. No
self respecting Oracle DBA would have that combination of books. That
alerted me that something was amiss.&#8217;</p>

<p>‘Oh come off it, Burns. I think you&#8217;re putting 2 and 2 together and
making 5 here. That&#8217;s very unfair -&#8217;</p>

<p>‘Dr. Hall. I opened the Burleson book up and noted the following
inscription on the inside cover: &#8216;Barry - all the best in the future and
may your redo logs always be multiplexed :-)&#8217; Therefore I conclude this
gentleman was dismissed from his previous post as a contract DBA
following an unfortunate, and ultimately fruitless, exercise in media
recovery. On a production system for an investment bank.&#8217;</p>

<p>‘Ah OK, I see, Burns. While we&#8217;re discussing the technical staff, I just
wanted to mention that PL/SQL developer. I think he needs to be sacked
too.&#8217;</p>

<p>‘Interesting, Dr. Hall. Why do you hold that opinion ?&#8217;</p>

<p>‘Well - when you asked him how much source code, how many lines of
PL/SQL, how many packages he&#8217;d written, he couldn&#8217;t produce anything.
Nothing. And to think he calls himself a &#8216;PL/SQL developer. He&#8217;s
obviously an imposter.&#8217;</p>

<p>Burns smiled inwardly.</p>

<p>&#8216;Not so fast, young, keen, impetuous Doctor Hall. While what you say is
true, the young man did proffer a explanation for this. He showed me a
source code repository populated with comprehensive, well written and
tuned SQL scripts. Why - I do declare he even used Analytic functions.
Young Mr. Barnstormworth justified his stance thus: “If it can&#8217;t be done
in a single SQL statement, use PL/SQL. If it can&#8217;t be done in PL/SQL,
use a Java Stored procedure. Otherwise consider ‘C&#8217;.”</p>

<p>Dr. Hall looked amazed as Burns had solved another mystery and he hadn&#8217;t
even had to chat with the Head of IT Operations.</p>

<p>‘Now my good man. That&#8217;s more than enough work for one morning. I am
ready to eat now and rather appropriately, I think I spotted a &#8216;Pret A
Manager&#8217; adjacent to the offices where we can discuss my forthcoming
‘State of the Nation&#8217; keynote presentation at Oracle OpenWorld.</p>

<p>The ‘Council Of War&#8217; was duly reassembled at 3pm and Sherlock Burns took
a long drag on his pipe before addressing the group:</p>

<ul>
<li>‘Fix the monitor probe interval.&#8217;</li>
<li>‘Sack the Oracle DBA.&#8217;</li>
<li>‘Promote Daniel Barnstomworth to &#8216;Senior VP of Database
Engineering&#8217;.</li>
<li>‘Deploy another RAC node by the end of the year to cater for the
increased user base.&#8217;</li>
<li>‘Here&#8217;s my invoice. Good Bye&#8217;.</li>
</ul>
