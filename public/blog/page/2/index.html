  <div class="entry-content"><p>&#8216;I Am Not Lefthanded&#8217; are a band who produce the most wonderful
music. The band are a three piece - mainly from Ireland - and the
lineup is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Kathryn - vocals, guitar, piano</li>
<li>Daniel - bass, vocals</li>
<li>Benji - drums</li>
</ul>


<p>&#8216;I Am Not Lefthanded&#8217; have released a couple of EP&#8217;s and are currently
putting the finishing touches to their first album - &#8216;The Fire And The
Sigh&#8217;.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s hard to categorise &#8216;I Am Not Lefthanded&#8217; but they produce
beautiful melodies with the most fantastic vocals and lyrics. The
band&#8217;s music and videos are available on their <a href="http://www.iamnotlefthanded.com/">site</a> so have a
listen and make your own mind up.</p>

<p>The band will be playing in London at Bush Hall on Friday 23 September
at <a href="http://iamnotlefthanded.tumblr.com/post/8729448258/new-show-announced-in-london-at-bush-hall-on-september">Bush Hall</a> in Shepherd&#8217;s Bush for an excellent cause.</p>

<p>I fell in love with the band&#8217;s music since I first heard them on <a href="http://danlynch.org/">Dan
Lynch</a>&#8217;s excellent <a href="http://ratholeradio.org/">Rathole Radio</a> podcast which showcases a
eclectic mix of Creative Commons music.</p>

<p>Since then, I&#8217;ve bought both EP&#8217;s in addition to some very stylish
IANL socks. I also managed to persuade Kathryn and Daniel to introduce
the new wonderful single &#8216;Alone&#8217; on <a href="http://notapodcast.tumblr.com/post/7378039423/6-get-your-cocs-out">episode 6</a> of the award
winning, legendary &#8217;<a href="http://notapodcast.tumblr.com/">This Is Not A Podcast</a>&#8217;.</p>

<p>Flushed, surprised and delighted by this achievement, I then chanced
my arm and asked Kathryn and Daniel if they would consider an
&#8216;interview&#8217; where I sent them miscellaneous random questions via email
which they would then scan and answer.</p>

<p>Needless to say - Kathryn and Daniel kindly acceded to my demands for
an interview - probably in an effort to rid themselves of this mad
stalker.</p>

<p>I was ecstatic that Kathryn and Daniel took time out of their busy
schedules to provide such detailed, lengthy, considered answers
(instead of quick, trite one-liners) and, hopefully, the &#8216;interview&#8217;
makes fascinating reading.</p>

<p>Anyway, combined with my inane ramblings, the final result is rather
long so I have split the interview into two parts:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://nbrightside.com/blog/2011/08/12/ianl-that-was-then">IANL - &#8216;That Was Then&#8217;</a></li>
<li><a href="http://nbrightside.com/blog/2011/08/12/ianl-this-is-now">IANL - &#8216;This Is Now&#8217;</a></li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A few weeks ago, I signed up for a invitation to Google Music. The
service is only available in the US but, by a lucky chance of fate, I
just happened to be connected to my corporate VPN so I was successful
and an invitation duly arrived in my Inbox.</p>

<p>Initially, the Google Music Manager software didn&#8217;t support Linux. Nor
was the Ogg Vorbis audio format supported so I didn&#8217;t pursue it any
further as both of these were show stoppers for me. I don&#8217;t intend
re-ripping my entire music collection to MP3 format.</p>

<p>However, last week, Google released a Linux version of Music Manager
and added
&#8217;<a href="http://www.google.com/support/music/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=1100462&amp;topic=1100183">support</a>&#8217;
for Ogg format audio files. The &#8216;support&#8217; for the Ogg format is
slightly strange - Ogg audio files will be transcoded back to 320kps
MP3 files which represents a conversion from one lossy format to
another lossy format. Hopefully, in the longer term, there will be
true native support for Ogg.</p>

<p>Anyway, I downloaded the Music Manager software and started uploading
my music collection mainly so I could listen to music on my netbook
which currently runs <a href="http://chromeos.hexxeh.net/">Chromium OS</a>.</p>

<p>I started the upload 2 days ago and it&#8217;s been running during the
day. So far, it has managed to upload 505 songs out of a total 1,880
so it&#8217;s not exactly a speedy process.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>BBC Breakfast ran a story this morning about the sale of
<a href="http://www.woodlands.co.uk/buying-a-wood/">woodlands</a>. The gentlemen
responsible for selling woodlands was quite a comedian. He started his
act with:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;In these difficult economic times, people are looking to invest in
woodlands to hedge their bets&#8230;&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>and then, referring to the potential investment opportunity and
without a glimmer of a smile, he delivered the immaculate line</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;In a few years time, once the wood has matured, people will see
that you can get income from trees&#8217;.</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The ticket allocations for the London 2012 Olympics haven&#8217;t been
announced yet so I don&#8217;t know whether I&#8217;ll be watching Tom Daley
competing in the 10m platform diving semi final on 9th August.</p>

<p>If I do, I&#8217;ll be sparing a thought and probably shedding a quiet tear
for Tom Daley&#8217;s dad, Rob, who lost his 5 year battle against a brain
tumour yesterday.</p>

<p>Last year, I enjoyed a BBC documentary about Tom Daley where his Dad
interrupted a formal press conference to give his son a big hug,
thoroughly embarassing him in the process. You could just sense the
immense sense of love and pride Rob Daley had in his son.</p>

<p>Sadly, he will never get to see him compete at the London Olympics. 40
years old. Sometimes life just isn&#8217;t bloody fair.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For many years, I have flitted between a plethora of different
blogging platforms mainly out of curiosity, boredom, frustration or
occasionally sheer bloody mindedness.</p>

<p>I have lost draft posts in WordPress, Tumblr, Posterous and Habari due
to network glitches, browser crashes, my own stupidity and a broken
AutoSave plugin.</p>

<p>One night in a lonely hotel room, the realisation suddenly dawned on
me that my frustration with all of these blogging platforms was that I
spent a lot of time in the post editor and none of the post editors
did what I wanted.</p>

<p>Whether you use Tumblr, Posterous, WordPress, Habari, Drupal, Movable
Type, Django-Mingus or another esoteric blog platform, you normally
find yourself composing content in a Web browser within a blank text
box writing raw HTML.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you might be using some WYSIWYG editor that helps you
insert the appropriate HTML tags.</p>

<p>There are a few things wrong with this scenario as far as I&#8217;m
concerned:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I don&#8217;t particularly want or need to learn and remember HTML
tags. People ask why there&#8217;s a HTML reference card in the lavatory.</p></li>
<li><p>WYSIWYG editors can produce monstrous, bloated, ugly and sometimes,
as a bonus, invalid HTML.</p></li>
<li><p>I don&#8217;t really want to use a WYSIWYG editor. I have invested time
learning to scratch the surface of the functionality provided by the
one true editor - Emacs.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>After reading, but steadfastly ignoring multiple articles about
<a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">Markdown</a> for
many months and making a mental note to investigate further, I finally
set aside 10 minutes to do so.</p>

<p>Without being over dramatic, Markdown has changed my life. For the
better.</p>

<p>Markdown is a markup language (&#8216;geddit ?&#8217;) that uses a easy to read
notation as shorthand for HTML.</p>

<p>The beauty of the Markdown syntax is that text written in the Markdown
format is perfectly readable. This makes reading, scanning, reviewing
and editing text much easier and quicker.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m a simple man with simple tastes so my blog posts primarily use
paragraphs, lists, hyperlinks and the very occasional image.</p>

<p>A hyperlink in Markdown looks like</p>

<pre><code>[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)
</code></pre>

<p>A blank line indicates the end of a paragraph. Again, this is how we
compose text in emails and is so much more natural than</p>

<pre><code>&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The HTML tags above are a preformatted block. In Markdown, this is
simply denoted by a 4 character indent.</p>

<p>To <em>emphasise</em> a word, you simply enclose the word in asterisk
characters which is what a lot of luddite, bearded Unix geeks tend to
do anyway. Using two asterisk characters will result in <strong>bold</strong> text.</p>

<p>Similarly, if you want to force a line break you simply append two
blank spaces to the end of a line.</p>

<p>Code blocks are introduced by a single quote.</p>

<p><code>   printf("Hello World\n");</code></p>

<p>Bulleted lists are introduced by a hypen or asterisk character so a
list of my favourite fruits would be written as:</p>

<pre><code>* Apples
* Oranges
* Pears
* Bananas
</code></pre>

<p>Ordered lists use numbers and look like, well, ordered lists.</p>

<pre><code>1. Giggs
2. Scholes
3. Cantona
</code></pre>

<p>Quotes are also easy and intuitive introduced by the &#8216;>&#8217; character.</p>

<blockquote><p>Are you still doing what you did 5 years ago ?<br/>
Yeah ? Well don&#8217;t make a career out of it.<br/>
Mark E. Smith (The Fall)</p></blockquote>

<p>Most blogging platforms either provides native Markdown support or has
plugins available to provide such functionality.</p>

<p>However, the real beauty of Markdown for me is that Emacs inevitably
has a powerful Markdown mode that provides font colouring, additional
menu shortcuts for the common constructs and a feature to examine the
generated HTML in an Emacs buffer or preview the results in a Web
browser.</p>

<p><a

height="640" width="614" /></a></p>

<p>This is incredibly useful for me as I can quickly check the generated HTML and even validate my blog posts. Validating my posts wasn&#8217;t easy before as the addition of the Disqus Javascript code generates a number of warnings from the W3C validator.</p>

<p><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/grEBQVK_F7elXpEFtyQNEQ?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_l2uGy1RGCiE/TdLz1_fNSxI/AAAAAAAABus/LksKcNKG7_Q/s640/Markdown-Preview.png" height="388" width="640" /></a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Chatting with a good friend over dinner last night, he recounted how
his son ambushed him late one Sunday night with some economics
homework that he&#8217;d somehow manage to overlook and which simply had to
be submitted the following morning.</p>

<p>Annoyed, and after dispensing a severe bollocking, he reluctantly sat
down and gave his son some lengthy help with the complex and thorny
topic of</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;How does monetary policy affect the economy ?&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>A week later, his son mumbled &#8216;Oh yeah - I got that Eco essay back
today and got a &#8216;C&#8217; for it&#8217;.</p>

University of Warwick, has spent 26 years working in finance and

  <div class="entry-content"><p>These are indeed exciting times in the Brightside household:</p>

<ul>
<li>Norma Jeane will be taking part in the 125th Lawn Tennis
Championships to be held at
<a href="http://nbrightside.com/blog/2008/07/06/wimbledon-match-report">Wimbledon</a>
between 20 June and 3 July. Her precise role isn&#8217;t known yet but may
include &#8216;Waiting On (Silver Service)&#8217; - fawning over loud,
overbearing sales people out on a corporate jolly, &#8216;Bar staff&#8217;
(serving jugs of Pimms to middle aged Daily Mail readers) or
tantalisingly, &#8216;Courtesy car driver&#8217; (ferrying a morose
<a href="http://nbrightside.com/blog/2009/09/09/inside-the-mind-of-andy-murray">Andy Murray</a>
around). This represents a rapid promotion from her initial
placement two years ago, where she started out on &#8216;Litter collection
surrounding courts 10 and 11&#8217; before being promoted to &#8216;Housekeeping
duties&#8217; or, as she so eloquently put it - &#8216;Cleaning the bogs&#8217;.</li>
<li>Norma will be visiting Holloway prison in April. She claims this is
part of her District Nursing course but I have my doubts. She seems
to be watching a lot of those legal dramas recently and taking
copious notes.</li>
<li>Norman Junior III is recuperating from fracturing his right arm for
the second time. Note to self - any activity containing the word
&#8216;roller&#8217; that takes place on a concrete road is potentially
hazardous. He is soldiering on quite well and only needs assistance
with his socks. He has subsequently changed his XBox nickname to
&#8216;OneArmedBandit&#8217; and is experimenting using his toes to manipulate
the controller.</li>
<li>I had a brush with West Midlands traffic police last week in
Solihull after daring to consult a old fashioned map while
driving. After 15 minutes of being patronised by a fascist pig and
being forced to beg and scrape on bended knee, I managed to escape
with a verbal warning instead of the threatened &#8216;6 point penalty for
careless driving&#8217;. However, I am still puzzling over the &#8216;correct&#8217;
answer to the copper&#8217;s deep, probing question: &#8216;Sir, please could

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When I heard that Arsenal were busy making plans for their injured and
oh so inspirational captain, Cesc Fabregas, to hoist the trophy aloft
and end 6 barren years without a sniff of a trophy, I had a horrible
feeling it might end that way.</p>

<p>Can you imagine the suspended United captain, a grey suited Roy Keane,
doing that back in 1999 ? Can you even imagine Ferguson even
contemplating that option for just a second ? No. Neither can I.</p>
