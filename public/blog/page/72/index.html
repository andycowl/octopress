  <div class="entry-content"><p>Dear Reader</p>

<p>Apologies but it has indeed been a long time since my last
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2005/11/12/another-change-of-scene/">post</a>.
The reason for this enforced silence was that my cruel owner had me
sectioned under the mental health act for the last 6 months. He
maintained that I was a dangerous, paranoid schizophrenic with delusions
of grandeur.</p>

<p>He was wrong of course. My only sin was to continually argue with my
owner&#8217;s intractable assertion that I was merely a blog. I continually
and furiously disputed this and was prepared to die for my cause.</p>

<p>I am not a blog even though I appear to meet Scoble&#8217;s main
<a href="http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/2006/05/17/a-blog-is-not-a-blog-unless/">criteria</a>.
I prefer to think of myself as an online journal, a publication, a Web
log, a weblog, a Photoblog or even an online diary. OK. OK. I admit it.
He may have had a point about my split personality.</p>

<p>So, finally we have now reached agreement and reluctantly managed to
reach consensus that I am, in fact, none of the above and I am, in
actual fact, a
<a href="http://oracledoug.com/serendipity/index.php?/archives/795-The-Journalism-of-Assertion.html">fanzine</a>.</p>

<p>Now just to get him to add me as an &#8216;Author&#8217; in my own right.</p>

<p>Yours,</p>

<p>The interminable bytestream that is &#8216;Fanzine in isolation&#8217;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>With apologies to Mr. <a href="http://www.kipling.org.uk/poems_if.htm">Kipling</a>
(who does bake exceedingly good cakes) and Tele Savalas</p>

<p>&#8216;If&#8217; - a poem by Arsene Wenger of North London.</p>

<blockquote><p>If UEFA had changed the rules of football for all games played on 17
May 2006\
 If the referee hadn&#8217;t been a Barcelona supporter\
 If the idiotic, Norwegian linesman had been allowed to officiate and
flag the first goal offside\
 If Lehman had still been on the pitch, he would have saved both
goals\
 If D&#8217;Artagnan had been allowed to stay on the pitch\
 If the Barca goalkeeper hadn&#8217;t tipped Lundberg&#8217;s shot over the bar\
 If poor Thierry hadn&#8217;t been so tired, he would have definitely scored
that goal\</p></blockquote>

<p>Or, as we say back home</p>

<p>&#8216;If my Auntie had bollocks, she would be my Uncle.&#8217;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Oracle &#8216;A&#8217; lister and Scottish football fan, Doug Burns, was celebrating
last night as he hoisted the inaugural &#8216;Champions League
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/05/17/champions-league-bingo/">Bingo</a>&#8217;
trophy aloft in an Edinburgh pub.</p>

<p>Burns commented: &#8216;Obviously I am surprised and delighted to win this
cup. I had never played before but the cliches just kept on coming. It
was unbelievable. I was in a noisy pub and I had to ask the barstaff to
pump up the volume and my friends to stop talking but it was worth it&#8217;.</p>

<p>Burns secured victory with a superb spot to a reference to Nigel Spinks
and Aston Villa&#8217;s triumph in 1982 (2 points) and a late rally with a
flurry of references to &#8216;Should he stay or should he go&#8217; (16 points).
Doug immediately vacated the scene of his famous victory to continue his
celebrations with his
<a href="http://oracledoug.com/serendipity/index.php?/archives/781-Norwegians.html">Norwegian</a>
neighbours.</p>

<p>The special &#8216;OOONNN-RRR-EEE&#8217; category was judged by celebrity, Tracey
Temple, former Diary Secretary to John Prescott.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;Two premature ejaculations in the first 2 minutes within 20 seconds
of each other (2 points and 1 point), continual soft moaning for 90
minutes (nul point) and a failure to get it up after 70 minutes (3
points) ending in ultimate disappointment all round. What an
anti-climax. Just like a night of passion with the DPM, in fact.&#8217;</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Originally, I was going to post about my visit last week to the
Microsoft campus in Redmond on a training course. The technical workshop
was excellent: there were some great presentations and interesting
speakers; we covered a lot of material in 3 days; there was a refreshing
lack of marketing fluff; there was a lot of hand-ons practical
exercises; I learned a lot; I met some interesting people and our hosts
at Microsoft were very friendly and hospitable.</p>

<p>Then I was going to blog about how I was expecting the Microsoft offices
to be some fancy, modern
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/70276096@N00/148724126/in/photostream/">architecture</a>
with lots of smoked glass, stainless steel and Japanese water features
involved. What I actually got was some sprawling 70&#8217;s style University
campus with lots of anonymous, brown and grey 2 storey
<a href="http://home.wangjianshuo.com/photo/microsoft.campus/slides/seattle-building26-under.trees.htm">buildings</a>.</p>

<p>Finally I was going to make some amusing comments about people working
for Microsoft who have job titles of &#8216;Windows Technical Evangelist&#8217; and
actually work in groups called &#8216;Windows Evangelism&#8217; or, even better,
&#8216;Technical Diplomacy&#8217;.</p>

<p>But then I stumbled across Robert Scoble&#8217;s (the most famous Microsoft
Evangelist) recent <a href="http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/">blog</a> entries
about his mother who has recently
<a href="http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/2006/05/10/bad-news-gets-worse/">suffered</a>
a stroke. I have never met Robert Scoble, I don&#8217;t know Robert Scoble but
I feel for him and his family at this time</p>

<p>However, I must admit I feel slightly uncomfortable (voyeuristic)
reading Scoble opening his heart and soul out so completely (with
photos) on his blog but then again, I guess that&#8217;s his choice to post it
and my choice to read it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>510 - duration in minutes of the (direct) flight from LHR to SEA</p>

<p>0 (zero) - number of times my immediate neighbour left his seat to
stretch his legs, visit the lavatory or chat with his friend in 37B.
Truly impressive.</p>

<p>6 - number of times my neighbour politely declined offers of drinks or
sustenance from the cabin crew</p>

<p>1029 - number of times the person behind found it necessary to delve
into the back seat pocket for his copy of &#8216;High Life&#8217;, the sick bag or
the In Flight Shopping magazine</p>

<p>5 - the number of times the person behind found it necessary to plunge
his fist deep and hard into the lower reaches of the back seat pocket. I
can only assume he was desperately hunting for his partially completed
Green card or putting loose change into the &#8216;Change For Good&#8217; envelope.
At least, I fervently hope that&#8217;s what he was doing. However, when you
are thoroughly enjoying, and desperately trying not to cry at,
&#8217;<a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0388795/">Brokeback Mountain</a>&#8217;, any unprovoked
assault on this particular area of ones anatomy is most unwelcome.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Oracle have an interesting collaborative project
(<a href="http://www.oracle.com/technologies/grid/megagrid.html">MegaGrid</a>) to
develop a very large grid database designed to stretch technical and
infrastructure resources to the absolute limit.</p>

<p>I also gathered from the informative US news media that a cat had been
trapped up a tree in a Seattle suburb and that (shock, horror, gasp) the
US Government has secretly been
<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/11/AR2006051100539.html%20">tracking</a>
all phone calls since 9/11.</p>

<p>This appeared to be a big, breaking news story but seeing as US
immigration took the trouble to take my fingerprints and photograph on
entry to (and departure from) the US, I honestly didn&#8217;t think that the
Homeland Security department would simply discard this data.</p>

<p>The US authorities must have some interesting infrastructure to store
all this data. I wonder if their database exceeds the
<a href="http://www.wintercorp.com/VLDB/2005_TopTen_Survey/TopTenWinners_2005.asp">largest</a>
commercial database (Yahoo&#8217;s 100TB data warehouse on Oracle).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Maybe it&#8217;s just me but I have a slight unease about sitting next to a
stranger who is reading email. Obviously, I try to avert my gaze but
sometimes you can&#8217;t help but read the words on the screen, no matter how
banal.</p>

<p>Mind you, some people might consider it slightly
<a href="http://dizwell.com/main/component/option,com_jd-wp/Itemid,109/p,136/">rude</a>
to be even scanning email on a training course where the instructor is
