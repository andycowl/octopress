  <div class="entry-content"><p>Back in May, I went along to my son&#8217;s school to hear James Cracknell
speak. Cracknell is an old boy of KGS and went on to become a double
Olympic gold medalist. Since his retirement from rowing, Cracknell has
embarked on a series of endurance challenges. Cracknell supplements his
income by writing for the Daily Telegraph and also gives after dinner
speeches about his adventures as well as motivational talks at corporate
events.</p>

<p>On a balmy May evening, I entered the school building and was pleasantly
surprised to see free champagne being dispensed to guests on arrival. I
stepped forward to the temporary bar to claim my complimentary glass of
bubbly. ‘Are you a Governor, Sir ?&#8217; ‘Err, no.&#8217; ‘Well - are you with the
VIP party, Sir ?&#8217; - the gentleman gestured to my right where I saw the
Headmistress chatting with Cracknell. ‘Err, well, err, no.&#8217; And with
that, the smartly dressed waiter, nodded disdainfully towards the Sixth
Form Common room where I was able to claim my free class of orange
squash in a plastic tumbler.</p>

<p>If Norman Junior III had been with me, this exchange would have been
excruciatingly embarrassing for him but sadly he couldn&#8217;t be bothered
coming along.</p>

<p>Before the main event, I paid a quick visit to the toilet and I noticed
James Cracknell, still politely chatting with the VIP&#8217;s, wearing an
immaculate charcoal grey suit, with a spotless white collared shirt and
no tie. To my horror, my eyes were drawn to his feet. He was wearing
trainers. One of my pet hates - idiotic commuters wearing suits and
trainers. Oh well, he&#8217;s won two Olympic Gold medals so I guess he can
wear whatever he likes.</p>

<p>Cracknell was a very personable, engaging, natural speaker and treated
us to a quick run through his career including his Olympic triumphs, an
insight into the level of commitment required to succeed at the highest
level of competitive sport and his trip to the South Pole. Sensibly,
Cracknell supplemented his talk with lots of photos. Interestingly, he
seemed to focus on his occasional failure (fourth in the rowing World
Championships in 2003) as much as his many successes.</p>

<p>James Cracknell is a very articulate, modest and amusing man. He
described failure at the World Championships as ‘doing what we normally
do. Train like hell for two years, getting up at 5am to get onto the
water on those dark, freezing winter mornings, qualify, get to the
final, push yourself to the limit, cross the finish line then stand on a
podium standing next to your best mate [Matthew Pinsent] who is crying
like a baby. Again&#8217;.</p>

<p>When Cracknell was selected to join the coxless four for the 2000
Olympic Games in Sydney, he was the newcomer into an established boat
with Olympic Gold Medalists, Steve Redgrave (4 Gold Medals) and Matthew
Pinsent (3 Gold medals) Understandably, he was a little intimidated by
these two and German coach, Juergen Grobler, attempted to reassure him</p>

<blockquote><p>‘Listen, James. You are strong. You are an excellent athlete with
great stamina and rowing technique. However, in this boat, you are
sitting behind Matthew. He is a better rower than you, stronger than
you with more stamina. All you have to do is follow him. Just do what
he does. Follow his stroke. Follow his every move. When he eases off,
you ease off. When he pushes the rate up to 43, you push the rate up
to 43. Matthew is hung like a horse.&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>A few months later, Cracknell was recounting this story about Juergen&#8217;s
motivational chat to Redgrave who smiled and said “I think Juergen
probably said ‘He has lungs like a horse&#8217;.”</p>

<p>Cracknell then described his first endurance event when he rowed across
the Atlantic with Ben Fogle. Towards the end of the race, the satellite
radio wasn&#8217;t working properly so the pair could only get daily updates
on their position and the state of the race.</p>

<p>One call told them they were now positioned second with 36 hours to go.
Fogel&#8217;s reaction was ‘Second - brilliant. What an achievement. Fantastic
!&#8217; whereas Cracknell&#8217;s immediate reaction was ‘Right - let&#8217;s stop these
3 hours on (rowing), 45 minutes off (rest) shifts and switch to 4 hours
one, 30 minutes off and see if we can win this bloody thing&#8217;.</p>

<p>Cracknell then solved the mystery of the immaculate grey suit and
trainers. He had recently returned from the Marathon Des Sables
endurance event where he had finished 12th in a race, the highest ever
placing for a Briton. During the 151 mile race across the Sahara desert
-, his feet were badly blistered - Cracknell showed an awful photograph
of his red raw feet after a day in the desert which he described as
‘slight chafing&#8217; - which explained the trainers and his slight limp as
he took to the stage.</p>

<p>Cracknell answered a question about how he motivated himself and he
referred to a note scribbled on a blackboard in a History classroom he
had seen earlier that evening on a tour of his old s</p>

<p>Cracknell answered a question about how he motivated himself and he
referred to a note scribbled on a blackboard in a History classroom he
had seen earlier that evening on a tour of his old school. Some wag
had written &#8216;All things must pass&#8217; which summed up his attitude pretty
well.</p>

<p>[ After I saw Cracknell, I was shocked to hear he had been knocked off
his cycle by a speeding truck when attempting another challenge to
cross the States in 18 days, rowing, cycling and running. Cracknell
was seriously ill with head injuries but thankfully is now making a
good recovery ]</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&#8216;Would you like any cashback today at all, Sir ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh yeah. That would be handy. &pound;50 - thanks.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh I&#8217;m awfully sorry. I haven&#8217;t got enough money in the till to give
you &pound;50, Sir.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh OK - how about &pound;30 then ?&#8217;</p>

<p>[Looks dolefully into depths of till] &#8216;Hmm - not really. That would
leave me a little short of cash.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Can you manage &pound;20 ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yeah, yeah.  &pound;20. I can give you &pound;20.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;OK great. I&#8217;ll take twenty then. Thanks.&#8217;</p>

<p>[Rummages in depths of till and brandishes two 10 pound notes which he
then withholds by holding them out of my reach] - &#8216;&#8230;but it really
would help me if you could just take &pound;10.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh - wait. No problem. It really doesn&#8217;t matter. Sorry to mess you
about. I&#8217;ll just go to the cashpoint outside to get some money. It&#8217;s
fine. Please, forget I ever mentioned cashback.&#8217;</p>

<p>Then, as I walked home, I remembered it wasn&#8217;t me that broached the
prospect of &#8216;cashback&#8217; at all - it was him.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last year, I visited a customer in Swindon. When I arrived at the
office, I noticed some water dripping from the underside at the front
of my car. I didn&#8217;t have time to investigate or get my hands dirty so
I subconsciously hoped it was just condensation from the air
conditioning unit and tried to forget all about it.</p>

<p>After work, I managed to navigate Swindon&#8217;s world famous roundabout of
roundabouts and finally locate my hotel. When I parked, I noticed the
temperature gauge was reading high - very high. Sure enough, I got out
of the car to see steam pouring out of the bonnet and was greeted by
the familiar smell of anti-freeze.</p>

<p>I still didn&#8217;t want to get my hands dirty so I opened the bonnet and
just stared at the problem, hoping that would miraculously fix
it. Then I checked in to my room and rang the AA. I introduced myself
to the operator as &#8216;Hi - my name is Norman and I&#8217;m an alcoholic.&#8217;</p>

<p>The AA man duly arrived before &#8216;The One Show&#8217; had even finished. We
both stood looking at the engine knowingly before he asked: &#8216;Now, Sir,
what seems to be the problem ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Well, I think it&#8217;s pretty minor and easy to fix. It&#8217;s just the top
hose has perished and needs replacing.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh I see, Sir. Why do you think that ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Well, when the engine was running, steam was pouring out of the top
corner of the radiator - right there where the water hose joins.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;OK, Sir. Thanks for that. Please could you just turn the engine over
for me so I can take a look myself ?&#8217;</p>

<p>Engine on. Water and steam billowing out.  Smell of
anti-freeze. Temperature gauge rising.</p>

<p>&#8216;Whoa ! That&#8217;s fine,
Sir. Engine off now, please. Well it&#8217;s not your hose, Sir. The problem
is over here. It&#8217;s your bleed screw, Sir. Look (flips the screw from
the middle of the radiator). This bleed screw has sheared off in
half. Quite a common problem on this model. Seen it a couple of times
now.&#8217;</p>

<p>I felt a little sheepish (but very relieved that a solution was
in sight) and the man from the AA, James, filled the radiator with 13
pints of cold water and I followed him to a local garage where we
parked and he kindly drove me back to the hotel so I could wash my
hands.</p>

<p>The next morning, I walked into the customer&#8217;s offices to be excitedly
greeted with &#8216;Oh good - glad you&#8217;re here. We have got
problems. Serious problems. Performance problems. On production.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Ah OK - what seems to be the problem ?&#8217; &#8216;Well it&#8217;s the database, you
see. It&#8217;s the hard disk - 99% busy. Partition 27b on logical volume 7
is overheating. Oh and another thing that might be relevant - the hit
ratio is right down at 72.7%&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;OK - thanks for that.  Do you think you could just start the system
up for me and I&#8217;ll take a look myself ?&#8217;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>What a terrible holiday period for Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab.</p>

<p>By the time, we had opened all our presents, stuffed ourselves with
turkey, fallen out over charades and finally slumped in front of
&#8216;Gavin &amp; Stacey&#8217;, Umar should have been sitting at the right hand of
Allah, surrounded by a variety of 57 vestal virgins, clad in white
silk lingerie, feeding him grapes, tending to his every whim, straddli
- [That&#8217;s enough vestal virgin fantasties - Ed].</p>

<p>Even worse, the young man does not have much to look forward to in the
coming weeks of 2010.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>His girlfriend is unlikely to accept his
perfectly reasonable explanation that the white, sticky stuff coating
his boxer shorts and trousers is indeed PETN explosive residue and
nothing more sinister after his 20 minute visit to the aircraft
lavatory, clutching a copy of &#8216;High Life&#8217; magazine.</p></li>
<li><p>Umar Farouk will need nerves of steel and great mental strength to
endure the endless questioning and sophisticated interrogation
techniques used by the FBI and CIA. Overcoming sleep deprivation,
maintaining stress positions for prolonged periods and surviving water
boarding are child&#8217;s play but heaven help him when the US authorities
play Metallica, David Gray and Dire Straits 24 hours a day with the
volume turned up to 11.</p></li>
<li><p>Poor Umar is unlikely to be able to claim a refund on his underwear
from Marks and Spencer. &#8216;I&#8217;m sorry, Sir but with no receipt we can
only offer you gift vouchers. In any case, these Y-fronts appear to be
worn and, worse, slightly soiled.&#8217;</p></li>
<li><p>If and when he should finally rediscover a place in his girlfriend&#8217;s
affections (after persuading her that he wasn&#8217;t pleasuring himself
when he placed the blanket over his waist), sexual intercourse is
going to be very painful with charred bollocks and a red hot poker
that is just like - well - a red hot poker with third degree burns.</p></li>
</ul>
