  <div class="entry-content"><p>Accidentally.</p>

<p>For the last two weeks, I have been savouring the joys of commuting
into the City on South West Trains and the London underground network.</p>

<p>Like most large, densely populated cities, <a href="http://www.tfl.gov.uk/">Transport for
London</a> has introduced a Smart Card system,
known as <a href="http://www.tfl.gov.uk/tickets/14836.aspx">Oyster</a>, which
allows ticketless travel on trains, tubes and buses.</p>

<p>Most modern cities in the developed world have similar smart card
technology resulting in a faster, more efficient transport system with
cheaper fares for passengers and reduced staffing costs at railway
stations.</p>

<p>Not London.</p>

<p>Last Tuesday, I disembarked at Bank underground station following a
hot, sweaty, uncomfortable 5 minute journey from Waterloo surrounded
by smart, professional merchant bankers wearing trainers and suits. As
usual, everyone strode out purposefully to get off the train first, to
reach the ticket barrier first, to climb the stairs first, to reach
the blissful cool fresh air first and finally, after a interminable 6
minute loss of communication, get a decent mobile phone signal so they
can immediately call the office to show how incredibly important they
are: &#8216;Will be there in 5. Passenger jumped onto live rail outside
Hinchley Wood&#8217;.</p>

<p>I ambled slowly along (marvelling yet again at Bryan Devendorf&#8217;s
drumming prowess) behind a gentleman who was rapidly approaching
ticket barrier No. 3. I withdrew my Zones 1-5 One Day Travel Card and
politely waited for the chap to &#8216;swipe through&#8217; (as we Cockney
trainspotters call it) and proceed towards the escalators.</p>

<p>Only he didn&#8217;t proceed because the failure rate on the Oyster card
system is high. Astonishingly high. The gentleman in front of me
tried to advance by waving his jacket pocket towards the card reader
but, inevitably, his Oyster card wasn&#8217;t recognised and nothing
happened.</p>

<p>I was listening to The National and wasn&#8217;t paying full attention so I
didn&#8217;t immediately notice his quandary until he gave a little yelp. In
fact, he may have given two yelps. One as he rammed into a very hard
and very stationary, unyielding ticket barrier. And another yelp as I
rammed into him from behind with great force.</p>

<p>Once we&#8217;d disentangled ourselves, he started to complain that I&#8217;d
physically assaulted him. I told him he shouldn&#8217;t buy an Oyster card
if he couldn&#8217;t use the bloody thing. One of the three staff manning
the ticket barriers - most countries eliminated all ticket barrier
staff whereas London had to triple staff manning the station exits -
separated us and a &#8216;revenue protection officer&#8217; then rubbed salt in
the wound by charging him full fare plus a &pound;10 penalty. I looked
disdainfully at his suit and then I looked down even more disdainfully
at his trainers.</p>

<p>I duly appeared in court yesterday charged with &#8216;Gross indecency in a
public place&#8217; but, inspired by &#8216;Judge Judy&#8217;, I conducted my own legal
defence, launching a magnificent counter claim of &#8216;Inappropriate use
of trainers coupled with a pinstripe suit&#8217;.</p>

<p>Thankfully, the judge saw sense and acquitted me after a forensic
scientist gave expert testimony that the rectal injuries sustained by
the gentleman may have been caused by the insertion of a tightly
rolled up copy of &#8216;The Metro&#8217; and not sexual assault.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Tuesday 1 June</p>

<p>Mr.  Capello announces the  final squad  of 23  players for  the World
Cup. There was the odd surprise  and some devastated players as we say
a tearful farewell to Huddza, Johnno, the Scott-Meister, Les (Dawson),
Dazza The  Bender, Walcottza and the  quiet one (I think  his name was
Leighton Baines).</p>

<p>Saturday 5 June</p>

<p>Rio and Heskey have a argument over Wii Tennis that carries over into
a training match. After winning a defensive header, Rio tells Heskey
&#8216;Dunno why you&#8217;re still here. I&#8217;ve scored more international goals
than you.&#8217; Heskey retaliates by sliding in by the corner flag and
sitting on Rio&#8217;s left knee.</p>

<p>Sunday 6 June</p>

<p>Rio has done medial ligaments and Mr. Capello is very cross. He had
put his name down for the Wii Tennis tournament and no-one told him
when he was on. Mr. Baldini reads the riot act and Rio goes to
hospital.</p>

<p>Mr. Ferguson rings me and is screaming so loud I have to hold the
receiver away from my sunburnt ear. He wants me to get Emile Heskey to
sit on me so I can miss the World Cup and get sent home to Manchester.</p>

<p>Monday 7 June</p>

<p>Crisis meeting mainly for the defenders but we all have to go which is
a shame as I was beating Joe Hart 79-71 in a Noughts and Crosses
marathon session in the hotel lobby.</p>

<p>A young fair haired lad called Dawson turns up. No-one really knows
who is he or why he&#8217;s here.  I think he might be an undercover
reporter or Joe Cole&#8217;s agent. Anyway, Mr. Baldini says he is replacing
Rio in the Wii Tennis tournament.</p>

<p>Mr.  Capello wants to sort out the communication between the back four
and the rest of the team. Rio used to call me &#8216;Wazza&#8217;, JT &#8216;Tezza&#8217;,
Stevie G &#8216;Gezza&#8217; etc so it was all quite easy. However, the young fair
haired lad can&#8217;t learn all these nicknames in time. Mr. Capello wants
us to use &#8216;Senor Rooney&#8217; but this takes too long. Baldini suggests
shortening this to &#8216;Rooney&#8217; which wins 20-5 in a vote.</p>

<p>After 37 minutes, plunged in silent, deep thought, Sean
Wright-Phillips says something: &#8220;What about Joe Cole and Ashley Cole ?
They will now both be called &#8216;Cole&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr.  Capello is annoyed at this interruption as dinner is nearly ready
and he asked for his favourite - Spaghetti Hoops - tonight so he
quickly ends the discussion: &#8216;Right - Ashley will be &#8216;55 grand&#8217; and
Senor Cole will be &#8216;Cole&#8217;.</p>

<p>Gareth Barry says that &#8216;Cole&#8217; sounds a little but like &#8216;Goal&#8217;
but Mr. Baldini says that won&#8217;t be a problem.</p>

<p>Tuesday 8 June</p>

<p>Papers giving me a lot of stick for reckless challenges, getting
booked and telling a referee to &#8216;Feck Off&#8217; in a friendly against John
Terry&#8217;s All Gold Platinum All Stars. I am summoned to a meeting with
Mr. Capello and the new captain Steve Gerrard. David Beckham is also
present - his main role was to coach Theo - but now he just has to
check no-one is wearing flip-flops and keep Rio&#8217;s spirits up.</p>

<p>Have a chat with Steve Gerrard and Jamie Carragher by the pool. They
are a little hard to understand (even for me) but they are in high
spirits. Steve reckons we can go all the way and win it this time. He
keeps saying &#8216;Listen, eh - la. Good things come in threes. Rio&#8217;s
injury gave me the captaincy. Rafa was sacked by Liverpool so this
must mean we are going to win it and Stevie Me will lift the World
Cup, instantly treble my value and get my dream move to Chelsea, sorry
Real Madrid.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>Hi Norman. You and I haven&#8217;t spoken before so please excuse the
intrusion. However Sandstone Search &amp; Selection are a specialist
recruitment consultancy, focused on the Enterprise Software and
Consulting markets. I&#8217;m keen to find out if you&#8217;re open minded about
your career please let me know. Rupert Smithers-Jones</p></blockquote>

<p>Hi Rupert. Yes - I am pretty open minded about my career and would
consider anything apart from pole dancing. Norman.</p>

<blockquote><p>Hi Norman. Excellent news ! Ping me when you have 5 minutes free to
chat about an exciting opportunity. Rupert</p></blockquote>

<p>Rupert - I typed &#8216;ping rupert&#8217; but my computer reported an error &#8216;rupert
is not responding&#8217;. Kind regards, Norman</p>

<blockquote><p>Norman - What would you say to an opening in pre-sales consulting for
a major, established blue chip based in London with some international
travel ? Rupert</p></blockquote>

<p>Hey Rupert I don&#8217;t wish to be rude but I think I&#8217;d rather be considered
for the &#8216;pole dancing&#8217; role. Do you have any such openings for tasteful
pole dancing - maybe at corporate events for IT companies. Although I
relatively new to the business, I do have a copy of &#8216;The Full Monty&#8217; on
DVD. Does that help ? Norman</p>

<blockquote><p>Norman - You&#8217;re confused. I&#8217;m a executive search and selection
specialist charged with head hunting the most talented and elite IT
professionals for the top FTSE 100 companies in the UK. I don&#8217;t find
temporary jobs for pole dancers. BTW What is your notice period ?
Rupert</p></blockquote>

<p>Rupert - My notice period is one month but I wouldn&#8217;t be available for
any new role until 1 September when I get out of hospital - Norman.</p>

<blockquote><p>Norman - I don&#8217;t wish to pry but what is the nature of your medical
procedure. It might affect the package I can secure for you - Rupert.</p></blockquote>

<p>Rupert - Please don&#8217;t worry - it&#8217;s just some minor surgery I&#8217;m having
done in Belarus. It the fourth and final part of my transgender
operation. From 1 September, I will be henceforth be known as
&#8216;Norma-Jeane&#8217;. This will most certainly affect my package and strong
pain killers will be required. Do you want an updated CV now to forward
to the client ? Thanks, Norman.</p>

<blockquote><p>Norman - This conversation is now over. Sorry to have troubled you.
Rupert. PS. If you know of any colleagues, relatives or numerate pets
who might be interested in IT jobs, please let me know. There&#8217;s a case
of 12 bottles of mixed French wine on offer for each successful
placement.</p></blockquote>

<p>Rupert - please don&#8217;t act like a bear with yellow trousers, red jumper
and a sore head. I had a chat with my &#8216;life coach&#8217; last night and we
decided that the time is ripe for a fresh, new challenge. I need to be
excited when I when I go to work. I need to be stretched (but gently). I
need to be stimulated again (but gently). Therefore, I am now looking
for a Linux system administration role or exotic dancing. Ideally, full
time Linux Sys Admin for a charity and part-time dancing at night. The
main reason for the transgender process was the increased earning
potential available to female strippers. This will enable me to get
enough money together for the &#8216;pole dancing&#8217; classes. Please let me know
- Norman.</p>

<blockquote><p>Norman - My colleague David is responsible for Linux recruitment. He
really likes the look of your CV and is confident he has a fantastic
opportunity. Do you have a beard as this would almost certainly secure
an interview ?</p></blockquote>

<p>Yes - but only before 1 September.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After weeks of anticipation, the day finally dawned - Thursday 6 May and
The National&#8217;s concert at the Royal Albert Hall.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been to the Albert Hall once before when I went to see Cirque de
Soleil. On that occasion, I was wearing a jacket and tie (family
birthday) and was perched precariously in the upper circle which gave
me vertigo.</p>

<p>I had some reservations about seeing a proper concert here and had
disconcerting images of posh people in dinner jackets, sitting down,
politely applauding an acoustic set. Anyway, I got the tube to High
St.  Kensington, stopped off at the Goat Tavern for a quick drink en
route.and then made my way to the famous venue next to Imperial
College.</p>

<p>I had a brilliant seat down in the stalls to the left of the stage and
thankfully although there were a few city types in suits, I didn&#8217;t
spot any dinner jackets or bow ties. As we waited for the band, I
heard two blokes talking loudly about the logistics of getting a taxi
afterwards and watched people queuing for Hagen Das ice-cream. Who
said &#8216;Rock&#8217;n&#8217;Roll&#8217; was dead ?</p>

<p>At 9:15pm, the various band members took the stage and opened with
&#8216;Mistaken for Strangers&#8217;. Thankfully, I think Matt sensed the slightly
subdued, reserved atmosphere and came forward, urging everyone to
stand up which immediately made for a much better time for everyone.</p>

<p>The National don&#8217;t travel light on tour. The band is formed of two
pairs of brothers; Aaron and Bryce Dessner (guitars), Bryan (drums)
and Scott Devendorf (bass) together with with singer Matt
Berninger. In addition, Padma Newsome plays violin, keyboards and, at
one point,some sort of accordion contraption. The ensemble is
completed by a brass section (trumpet, trombone).</p>

<p>Occasionally, I&#8217;ve tried to pinpoint why I like The National so much
and the two main factors are Bryan Devendorf&#8217;s metronomic, unceasing,
crisp drumming (which is usually high in the mix) and Matt&#8217;s thought
provoking, ambiguous lyrics.  As the crowd became more appreciative
and vocal, the band proceeded with a brilliant set throwing in old
favourites from &#8216;Alligator&#8217; and &#8216;Boxer&#8217; together with most of the
songs from the yet to be released &#8216;High Violet&#8217;.</p>

<p>Matt joked about the cavernous and imposing size of the venue (&#8216;I
wrote this song in a small room like this&#8217;) and then proceeded to
forget the lyrics to &#8216;Baby - we&#8217;ll be fine&#8217;. He tried again before the
band aborted the attempt and moved on to &#8216;Afraid of Everyone&#8217; (&#8216;Don&#8217;t
worry - this is a new one and I know the lyrics&#8217;).</p>

<p>Not surprisingly, the acoustics and sound was brilliant although a
neighbour also wanted to &#8216;turn the drums up&#8217; and the band performed
two of my favourite songs ; Conversation 16&#8217; and &#8216;Apartment
Story&#8217;. Like most of Matt&#8217;s lyrics, &#8216;Conservation 16&#8217; can be
interpreted in many different ways. It sounds like a love song
(&#8216;You&#8217;re the only thing I ever want anymore&#8217;) but then savagely turns
into a loveless, broken, hate-filled relationship (&#8216;I was afraid I&#8217;d
eat your brains Cause I&#8217;m evil&#8217;).</p>

<p>It&#8217;s clear the band are musical perfectionists - in recent interviews
the band make it clear the production process is slow, iterative and
laborious and scrupulous attention is paid to every last detail. To be
honest, although I like &#8216;High Violet&#8217;, I do find some songs rather
bleak; &#8216;Sorrow&#8217; in particular. In fact, at times, you find yourself
reaching for Joy Division&#8217;s &#8216;Closer&#8217; in an effort to lighten the
mood. However, some of the &#8216;High Violet&#8217; material which left me
lukewarm was completely transformed when performed live (&#8216;England&#8217;).</p>

<p>Also, although I absolutely love the song, I find the lo-fi mix of
&#8216;Terrible Love&#8217; on &#8216;High Violet&#8217; so ropey I can hardly bring myself to
listen to it. Again, I read in interviews that Matt wanted to cut out
all the shouting (e.g. &#8216;Abel&#8217; on &#8216;Alligator&#8217;) and the band were also
keen to create a less polished production than on &#8216;Boxer&#8217;. Personally,
I think the production and quality of &#8216;Boxer&#8217; was so immaculate, so
perfect I would have used the same studio, the same producer, the same
instruments and worn the same lucky underpants.</p>

<p>However, Aaron seemed to deliberately favour the raw, unpolished
version of &#8216;Terrible Love&#8217;; in fact, he acknowledges that, even after
the weeks of mixing, some completed &#8216;High Violet&#8217; tracks are very
close to the original demo tapes. Anyway, back to the concert and the
band closed with &#8216;Fake Empire&#8217; and returned to the stage for a
magnificent encore comprising:</p>

<ul>
<li>Vanderlyle Cry Baby Geeks - one of the lighter, more accessible
songs from &#8216;High Violet&#8217;.</li>
<li>All the Wine - one of my all time favourite National songs musically
and lyrically.</li>
<li>Mr November - Matt went walkabout way out into the lower circle for
this one.</li>
<li>Terrible Love - superb with all the additional musical elements.</li>
<li>About Today - the only song I had never heard before - an extended
guitar jam slowly building to a cresendo.</li>
</ul>


<p>It was weird hearing &#8216;Mr. November&#8217; which was used in Barack Obama&#8217;s
presidential campaign on election day in Britain and hearing hundreds of
people screaming in unison:</p>

<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m the new blue blood I&#8217;m the great white hope. I&#8217;m the new blue
blood. I won&#8217;t fuck us over, I&#8217;m Mr. November. I&#8217;m Mr. November, I
won&#8217;t fuck us over.</p></blockquote>

<p>I didn&#8217;t bother taking any day tripper, tourist photos but <a href="http://de-online.co.uk/">David
Emery</a> has some fantastic
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/davidemery/sets/72157623885785947/show/">photos</a>
of an unforgettable night.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://theappslab.com/about/">Jake Kuramoto</a> from Oracle Apps Lab has
a great
<a href="http://theappslab.com/2010/04/29/how-do-you-get-to-facebook/">post</a>
about common search terms for the three main search engines and notes
that &#8216;facebook.com&#8217; (and variants thereof) appear in the lists of most
frequently used keywords.</p>

<p>Recently, I have been observing my wife who is a non-technical
(Firefox) user although I must admit to a vested interest here. I am
keen to understand any areas where Linux Mint is &#8216;worse then
Windows&#8217;. Over the last few weeks, I have noted the following:</p>

<p>The Web browser is Firefox 3.6 and the starting page is a
single tab - Google.com (my choice).</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/ZJS8JDKA4zwaqr8Uv2csjw?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_l2uGy1RGCiE/S9qZ22ROL5I/AAAAAAAABg8/lrAbGji3aHg/s400/Screenshot.png" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p>This start page is minimalist in the extreme and dominates the screen.
The user is instinctively drawn to this large, central area of the
screen. Note to Google designers: This striking, beautiful minimalism
is rather spoiled once you use the mouse.</p>

<p>My wife&#8217;s Web session starts here. It always starts here. She might be
searching for &#8216;john lewis&#8217;, &#8216;maths revision guides&#8217;, &#8216;how to kill
husband and get away with it&#8217; or &#8216;weather london&#8217;. It is entirely
logical that, if she wants to visit Facebook, she will simply hit
&#8216;Home&#8217; and initiate another &#8216;mini-session by searching for &#8216;facebook&#8217;
(or some variant).</p>

<p>This may not the the quickest, optimal way of getting the job done but
it&#8217;s quick enough, it works and it is a learned behaviour.</p>

<p>I agree about search being more forgiving than typing raw text into
the address bar. Google does the right thing with &#8216;facebok&#8217; but the
address bar doesn&#8217;t. Don&#8217;t try this experiment at work as it&#8217;s
potentially NSFW.</p>

<p>However, I think the key issue here is more about usability. The
Google search page dominates the screen and the centrally placed
search box dominates the Web page. Her eyes are drawn towards it. It
is much harder for the brain to even consider the alternative options
of &#8216;address bar&#8217; &#8216;search bar&#8217; or even &#8216;Bookmarks&#8217; because these
options are located at the top of the screen and are tiny in
comparison - almost inconsequential. Therefore the brain has to do
more work - particularly for &#8216;Bookmarks&#8217; which nestles between
&#8216;History&#8217; and &#8216;Tools&#8217;.</p>

<p>Coincidentally, I recently exposed the Bookmarks Toolbar with just two
sites (Amazon, Facebook). These icons are now relatively large and
easily visible and using them to quickly navigate is just a single
mouse click but I don&#8217;t believe she uses them. Old habits die hard
perhaps.</p>

<p>This isn&#8217;t being patronising but I don&#8217;t believe she knows what the
address bar is. Until recently, she didn&#8217;t know what the search bar
was. When I explained that the &#8216;Google&#8217; in the bar and the magnifying
class icon indicated you could search by typing into this text box,
her reaction was &#8216;Oh so it&#8217;s like the Home page but smaller&#8217;. I am
sure this mentality isn&#8217;t unique among novice and non technical users.</p>

<p>She finds it confusing that the address bar takes things like
&#8216;amazon.com&#8217; (URL&#8217;s) whereas the search bar takes &#8216;amazon UK books&#8217;
(search terms) and gets the two confused. Mostly this ambiguity
doesn&#8217;t affect the end result but it&#8217;s confusing and poor UI design.
Chrome addresses this nicely with a single unified bar which is
exactly how it should be.</p>

<p>My wife often bookmarks stuff and recently complained that &#8216;Bookmarks
don&#8217;t work. I can never find stuff again.&#8217; It transpired that she
expected her lengthy list of Bookmarks to be listed in reverse
chronological order and was unaware of the &#8216;Recently Bookmarked&#8217;
submenu. But then again, that&#8217;s a extra click. Again, more work for
the brain and people are lazy.</p>

<p>Although I am not a Web designer, I find usability and user interface
design a fascinating area. I would love to conduct detailed interviews
with my wife, my kids and my father to compare and contrast their
usage of their respective computers.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of my favourite bands is American beat combo - <a href="http://www.americanmary.com/">The
National</a>. I will forever be indebted to
<a href="http://twofishcreative.com/michael/blog/">Michael</a> for introducing me
to the band.</p>

<p>Yesterday, I received an email that said a handful of tickets for the
sold out gig at the Royal Albert Hall on 6 May in London would be
going on sale today at 3pm. These tickets were originally &#8216;being held
for lighting, sound and film equipment (for a possible filming of the
performance) that we have decided to pull.&#8217;</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t hold out much hope but am delighted to say I have just
secured a ticket.</p>

<p>The National have a new album &#8217;<a href="http://www.highviolet.com/">High
Violet</a>&#8217; coming out on May 11. It&#8217;s rather
difficult (and pointless) trying to categorise the band&#8217;s music (try
listening to &#8216;Boxer&#8217; yourself) but I really like Matt Berninger&#8217;s
voice and lyrics.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a free download of &#8216;Bloodbuzz Ohio&#8217; available and here&#8217;s a
video of my favourite song, &#8216;Terrible Love&#8217; (also from &#8216;High Violet&#8217;).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Short answer - She was in a meeting. I sent a polite email asking why my
MP Susan Kramer failed to vote last night on the third reading of the
Digital Economy Bill.</p>

<blockquote><p>Dear Mrs Kramer</p>

<p>Many thanks for taking the time to send me a long and detailed
letter is response to my email inquiry about your stance on the
Digital Economy Bill.</p>

<p>You&#8217;re right - it&#8217;s a very complex issue and may yet be subject to
refinements before it finally becomes law.</p>

<p>However, as you seemed to support the bill but oppose certain
clauses, I was curious to find which way you voted last night in
Parliament at the bill&#8217;s third reading.</p>

<p>From reviewing
<a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm/cmtoday/cmdebate/32.htm">Hansard</a>,
it appears you couldn&#8217;t be bothered to vote at all. Which disgusts
me.</p>

<p>You&#8217;ve just lost another vote in the forthcoming general election.</p></blockquote>

<p>I then received this response</p>

<blockquote><p>Thank you for all you emails regarding the Digital Economy Bill. Susan
has asked me to respond on her behalf and I hope you don&#8217;t mind my
doing so. Please accept my apologies for the group email but we have
received so many emails on this issue that it is the only way I will
be able to respond to you all today.</p>

<p>First of all let me assure you that this is a very important issue
to Susan and the rest of the Parliamentary Lib Dem party and she
takes your views very seriously.</p>

<p>The Government has been intent on forcing through the Digital
Economy Bill through the ‘wash up&#8217; as they believed it would face
less opposition with many MP&#8217;s having already left Parliament for
their constituencies. The Government was so desperate to get this
Bill through in fact that they pulled DCMS Minister Ben Bradshaw off
his slot on News Night.</p>

<p>Bills going through the wash up are usually done in a more secretive
fashion and full parliamentary party attendance is not required or
expected. For this reason there were not many MPs there, but Lib Dem
Shadow Minister Don Foster was debating on behalf of the Lib Dems. I
have been in contact with his office over the course of the past few
days passing on messages of concern from a number of
constituents.</p>

<p>As many of you may be aware the Liberal Democrats were completely
opposed to this Bill going through the wash up and wanted it to come
before Parliament when it resumes after the election so that it may
be subject to full scrutiny and debate. We were originally intending
to table an amendment to clause 43 but decided, in light of fierce
opposition to the clause, to oppose it totally. The Tories were
planning to support the Government but barely any Tory MPs actually
turned up.</p>

<p>We were unaware that there was going to be a vote on the Bill until
only an hour beforehand. Susan was at that time in a very important
meeting in the Constituency and despite trying, could not make it to
Westminster in time. For your assurances, she would have opposed the
Bill totally. Thankfully and with the help of some labour rebels and
individuals, we managed to oppose the Bill.  All Lib Dem MPs in
Westminster at the time voted against the 3rd Reading of the
Bill.</p>

<p>As I am sure you will now be aware Clause 43 has been totally
dropped from the Bill. This is a fantastic result.  Furthermore it
is doubtful the rest of the Bill will make it onto the Statute books
before Dissolution. Hopefully Susan will be re-elected and if so,
she has promised to make the future readings of the DEB a priority
and will be at future votes to represent your views.</p>

<p>I hope this has been of some interest to you, please do let me know
your views when the DEB comes before the next Parliament and do not
hesitate to contact me should you have any further concerns on this
or any other issue.</p></blockquote>

<p>Words fail me. <em>We were unaware that there was going to be a vote on the
Bill until only an hour beforehand.</em></p>

<p>Great. That really reassures me that you are on top of things.</p>

<p><em>Hopefully Susan will be re-elected.</em></p>

<p>There&#8217;s more chance of Manchester United winning the Champions League
that Susan Kramer securing my vote.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One attraction of my glamorous life as an IT consultant travelling all
over Europe is the opportunity to conduct illicit affairs with
beautiful lap dancers from Prague (who are definitely not
transvestites). For the last three years, I have been secretly engaged
in such a liaison with a beautiful young lady called Iris.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, due to Iris&#8217; work commitments, our meetings are limited
to brief, breathless, stolen trysts in the arrivals and departure
halls at the various terminals at London Heathrow.</p>

<p>Originally, like most shy, reserved young ladies being stalked by an
aging, overweight business man, Iris played slightly hard to get and
actually stood me up on our first
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/10/03/stood-up-by-iris/">date</a>
but I wasn&#8217;t to be deterred and I persevered to win the heart of my
beloved.</p>

<p>Eventually, the course of true love prevailed and our relationship
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/02/09/great-fun-with-iris">blossomed</a>.
Iris and I enjoyed furtive, passionate encounters in the toilets at
Heathrow with novelty
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/01/19/probably-the-best-marketing-campaign-ever">condoms</a>
to spice up the relationship.</p>

<p>Whenever I returned to the UK after being abroad, I would positively
look forward to meeting Iris and staring into her eyes. In fact, if I
didn&#8217;t stare into her eyes, she would often scold me in her dull,
mechanic monotone voice: &#8216;Please stand back a little&#8217; or &#8216;Please move
to the right&#8217;.</p>

<p>However, when I finally got the positioning correct, I was rewarded by
an orgasmic moan: &#8216;Ooh - aah.  That&#8217;s right. Ooh - aah Cantona. That&#8217;s
perfect. Just keep it there.&#8217;  Then, she would part her smoked glass
double doors and invite me to enter the gateway to heaven. And baggage
reclaim.</p>

<p>Last Friday, I returned from Dusseldorf (near Germany) and returned
via Terminal 1. My excitement mounted as I made my way to meet Iris as
I hadn&#8217;t seen her since a short trip to a freezing Helsinki (near
Finland) in January.</p>

<p>My heart raced as I finally set eyes on Iris again but I could
immediately sense something was wrong. She seemed cold and aloof. She
didn&#8217;t acknowledge my presence in the booth. She didn&#8217;t look into my
eyes. She didn&#8217;t ask me to move closer. Nor did she ask to me move
away.</p>

<p>A stony silence ensued. The tension grew. I moved forward - no
reaction. I desperately tried to look Iris in the eyes but
nothing. Suddenly, Iris asked me to look into the middle camera unit
and I found myself squatting down, desperately trying to catch her eye
and get her attention.</p>

<p>The interminable silent treatment from my lover continued.  God - this
was so embarrassing. I could sense the whole army of arriving
passengers staring at Iris and I falling out of love.</p>

<p>Then finally, she came out and said it. She didn&#8217;t bother with any
pleasantries. No long, rambling, tearful conversation starting &#8216;Dear
John&#8217;. No hesitant &#8216;This isn&#8217;t about you - it&#8217;s about me.&#8217; Iris just
ended our three year relationship - three years filled with laughter,
joy and slurping noises - with the immortal words: &#8216;Your data can not
be reconciled. Please seek assistance.&#8217;</p>

<p>With my face reddening, I turned to go. To my horror, a lengthy queue
of important looking business types (some with BA Executive Gold
cards) had slowly gathered behind Iris. Iris already had a stream of
30 handsome suitors queuing up to take my place. As I walked away,
crestfallen, I overheard a gentleman mutter &#8216;Idiot - you shouldn&#8217;t
even be allowed to use Iris.&#8217; while another said &#8216;I&#8217;m going to miss my
meeting now, you fool.&#8217;</p>

<p>Broken, I walked away and took my place in the queue for conventional
passport control. After 25 minutes, the Iris queue had fully
dissipated and my paper passport was checked fleetingly by a pretty
young lady with auburn hair and a striking figure.</p>

<p>She smiled knowingly: &#8216;Have you just been rejected by Iris ?&#8217; &#8216;No -
what on earth makes you think that ?&#8217; &#8216;Well - I watched you get
rejected by Iris earlier, your face is blotchy and I can tell you&#8217;ve
been crying.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Anyway, forget Iris - let&#8217;s talk about us. What time do you knock off
tonight ?&#8217;</p>

<p>[ This whole sorry episode will be screen on &#8216;UK Border Force&#8217; on Sky
1 on Thursday April 8 at 20:00 ]</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Idea for a new TV series - &#8216;When Ethernet cables go bad&#8217; - A
fascinating 60 minute documentary into the wide range of issues people
have with wireless networks. The program would also include some &#8216;C&#8217;
list celebrities and a phone/text in competition to win something.</p>

<p>I have had a wireless network in my house for at least four
years. Perusing the annals of this blog reveals that while I have
experienced
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/04/11/wireless-upgrade/">various</a>,
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/02/24/wireless-wierdness/">sporadic</a>
<a href="http://nbrightside.com/blog/2006/04/17/more-wireless-fun">issues</a>
over this period, by and large, the wireless network has been pretty
reliable with three PC&#8217;s, a laptop and an iTouch device using it
without problems.</p>

<p>Most issues could be resolved simply by rebooting the router and cable
modem or very occasionally traced to a broader problem with network
connectivity from my ISP, Virgin Media.</p>

<p>Recently, my 7x24 Internet monitoring service known as my son came
down into the lounge to watch TV. This normally means one thing - the
Interweb is down and Call of Duty is missing one of their
Lieutenants. And so it proved.</p>

<p>On this occasion, rebooting the router and modem didn&#8217;t resolve the
problem and plugging a laptop into the cable modem proved that the
lack of connectivity wasn&#8217;t due to Virgin Media.</p>

<p>A hard reset to the factory defaults and running an open network
worked. For a while. Then the router dropped again. Installing the
Linksys firmware to replace the open source and freedom loving
<a href="http://www.polarcloud.com/tomato">Tomato</a> software worked. Briefly.
Then it broke again. Stubbornly the router reported &#8216;Could not renew
lease.&#8217;. No matter how many times, or how hard, I hit the &#8216;Renew
Lease&#8217; button.</p>

<p>This state of affairs simply could not continue so after investigating
a little on the Interweb, I reached the reluctant conclusion that my 5
year old Linksys wireless router was, in technical terms, broken.</p>

<p>Curiously, for me, I spontaneously decided to buy another Linksys
router to replace it. A like for like replacement.  Subconsciously,
despite the unit failing, I still viewed Linksys as reliable and found
myself strangely reluctant to try another make and model.</p>

<p>I quickly shopped around and purchased a <a href="http://www.ebuyer.com/product/103185">Linksys
WRT54GL</a> and, to my surprise,
found it slightly cheaper at ebuyer.com than my usual preference for
online purchases - Amazon. The router arrived the next day and I was
able to quickly configure the network again as the family gathered
expectantly inquiring &#8216;Can I play Call of Duty yet ?&#8217;, &#8216;When can I
check my email ?&#8217; and &#8216;Listen - I need to get on Facebook now.&#8217;</p>

<p>Everything ran smoothly and everyone was deliriously happy. For 8 days
until Norman Junior III came down into the lounge to watch TV
again. After a period of 8 full days without watching any TV or
speaking to us.</p>

<p>&#8216;Is it down again ?&#8217; &#8216;Yeah - I rebooted both boxes and
my PC can see the router but the router can&#8217;t access the Internet.&#8217;</p>

<p>Back upstairs to stare at the Administration screens and the
worryingly familiar &#8216;Can not renew IP address&#8217; message. This time, I
installed the Tomato firmware which worked briefly. I then reverted to
the Linksys firmware as I prepared to raise the problem with Linksys
technical support. But I didn&#8217;t need to as, after resetting to the
factory defaults and reconfiguring, it worked. Internet access was
restored. Everyone was happy and didn&#8217;t thank me. For a couple of
days.</p>

<p>This loss of connectivity was now a complete mystery and now
starting to get very irritating. Brand new router. Sporadically
failing. My son and I stared at the blue box with the flashing lights
and the contents of the new router box looking for the sentence on
&#8216;Troubleshooting&#8217;.</p>

<p>Norman Junior broke a rather stony and tense silence: &#8216;What&#8217;s that
blue cable ?&#8217; &#8216;Oh - it&#8217;s just an Ethernet cable that came with the
router.&#8217; &#8216;Maybe that would work better as it&#8217;s brand new.&#8217; &#8216;It won&#8217;t
be that. These problems are not caused by an Ethernet cable. They
either work or they don&#8217;t.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What&#8217;s the harm in trying it though ? We haven&#8217;t got any other ideas,
have we ?&#8217; So I exhaled loudly, sighed, threw in a couple of
expletives and switched the original grey Ethernet cable supplied all
those years ago by Virgin Media with a shiny, new, slightly shorter
blue Ethernet cable.</p>

<p>And lo and behold, the blue Ethernet cable worked. Access to the
wireless was restored. The bloody Internet worked. Perfectly. For 3
weeks, 4 days and 17 hours and counting. Rock solid.</p>

<p>He&#8217;s a bloody genius, my son.</p>

<p>And the elephant in the room - the original &#8216;failed&#8217; Linksys WRT54G
router sitting up on top of the wardrobe, taunting me, calling to me,
nagging away at me like a dripping tap. The temptation to switch back
to the original router and try it with the blue Ethernet cable is one
I have been able to resist. So far.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Working title: the dangers of Facebook, online dating, stranger danger
and gross stupidity.</p>

<p>The (now defunct)
<a href="http://www.thechameleons.com/">Chameleons</a> remain one of my favourite
bands but were responsible for the most embarrassing night of my life.</p>

<p>After the band reformed, I went to their London gigs and occasionally
frequented the (now defunct)
<a href="http://forums.thechameleons.com/">Wishville</a> forums for discussion
about the band, concert reviews, banter about football, discovering new
bands - all the usual stuff we did before Twitter and Last.fm came
along.</p>

<p>In November 2002. The Chameleons played a single date in London
before a German tour. As I had struck up a friendship with a like minded
individual on Wishville (liked footy, liked The Chameleons, liked a
laugh) and exchanged messages with him, we arranged to meet up for a
drink in Camden before going on to the gig.</p>

<p>Mark Burgess is a City fan,
so he&#8217;d arranged the gig deliberately to clash with United playing Bayer
Leverkeusen in the Champions League so I&#8217;d hoped to see most of the game
before going to the venue.</p>

<p>Anyway, we exchanged mobile phone numbers,
exchanged descriptions and arranged to meet in an Irish pub (public bar)
that was showing the football. I didn&#8217;t tell my Mummy in case she was
worried about me meeting a strange man I&#8217;d recently met on the Interweb.</p>

<p>Inevitably, something screwed up on the night mainly because we are
blokes. I can&#8217;t recall precisely what happened but someone had a flat
battery, lost their phone or told their Mummy so I arrived at this
hostelry and furtively tried to identify this gentleman from a (Wedding)
photo he&#8217;d shown me.</p>

<p>To cut a long story short, I couldn&#8217;t find him and he couldn&#8217;t find
me. Worse, the footy wasn&#8217;t been shown in the Irish pub or rather, I
think Arsenal was being shown instead of United, so I went elsewhere
to watch the game.</p>

<p>After a few beers and United taking a 2-0 lead, I made my way to
Dingwalls. Now, there was no way I was going to make contact with my
&#8216;Internet acquaintance&#8217; in a packed venue so I was quite prepared to
enjoy the support (Brian Glancy), soak up the pre-match atmosphere,
drinking overpriced lager while watching the technicians twiddle
buttons on amps, place guitars on stands and say &#8216;One Two - One Two&#8217;
into microphones while waiting for The Chamleons to take the stage.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, as always, alcohol intervened and as I watched Glancy
performing, I happened to see a young lady who was also a regular on
Wishville. This young lady spent every spare minute and every spare
quid on watching bands and had traipsed around Germany and the States
following The Chameleons on tour.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I only knew
&#8216;Cath&#8217; by reputation and only recognised her by virtue of her
distinctive dyed red hair. While I enjoyed her superb gig
<a href="http://blogs.myspace.com/upthedownescalator">reviews</a>, we&#8217;d never
communicated directly so I didn&#8217;t know her and she certainly didn&#8217;t know
me.</p>

<p>I should have just left it well alone but for some reason I didn&#8217;t
and I approached a complete stranger (a female one at that) and
memorably opened with: &#8216;Hi Cath. Do you know where Joe is ?&#8217;</p>

<p>Cath Aubergine (for that was her rather unusual name) broke off her
conversation with her mate, turned to me and replied: &#8216;Sorry - what ?
Joe who ? Who are you ?&#8217;. There may have been the odd expletive thrown
in for good measure.</p>

<p>&#8216;Joe - I arranged to meet him here but&#8230;.&#8217;</p>

<p>Blank stare. Her mate is also now looking at me with a similar blank
stare.  27.4 seconds left before the 6&#8217;2&#8221; boyfriend returns from the
bar with their drinks.</p>

<p>&#8216;Look - you know. Joe - Mr. Moto. Have you seen
him ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh Mister Moto - why didn&#8217;t you say ? But what&#8217;s your name ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Andy.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Sorry - did you say &#8216;Andy&#8217; ?&#8217; Another piercing, blank,
suspicious stare. Times two.</p>

<p>&#8216;Look. I&#8217;m RomanTotaleXVII on the forums but my real name&#8217;s Andy,
alright&#8217;. Christ - the embarrassment levels were now excruciating as
we were having to shout this conversation above the noise of Bryan
Glancy&#8217;s set.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh so you&#8217;re RomanTotaleXVII but hang on - you&#8217;re not RomanTotaleXVII
any more. You are now&#8230;&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yeah, yeah I know.  I&#8217;m now FieryJack.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yeah - you&#8217;re the guy who names himself after The Fall
characters. Well why didn&#8217;t you just say so ?&#8217;</p>

<p>And so it came to pass - Cath Aubergine led me to the bar area and
introduced me to Mr. Moto (aka Joe Donellan).</p>

<p>&#8216;Hey Joe - I&#8217;ve got someone who wants to meet you. Here he is -
RomanTotaleXVII&#8217;.</p>
