  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was lucky enough to accompany Norman Junior to the Emirates Stadium
yesterday to see Arsenal thrash Sunderland 3-2. An ex-colleague has two
season tickets (Section C, Row 4) and kindly offered them to me.</p>

<p>Although Arsenal aren&#8217;t my team, it was still great to go and see a
match as opposed to my usual viewpoint perched on my barstool.</p>

<p>The Emirates Stadium is really impressive. The view for all spectators
is superb, there is plenty of legroom and the seats are actually padded.</p>

<p>We had a brilliant view from row 4 in the Arsenal &#8216;end&#8217; and we watched
the Arsenal goalies warming up. Bizarrely, Arsenal fans derive a
disproportionate amount lot of pleasure simply from spotting their mates
in another section of the ground.</p>

<p>As always, Sunderland brought an impressive, loyal and vocal support for
an away fixture which the FA had helpfully scheduled for a 12 noon
kick-off on Sunday.</p>

<p>The game got underway and Arsenal started impressively, stroking the
ball around. Arsenal created early chances at will and deservedly took
the lead after just 7 minutes when van Persie rocketed a free kick in
off the underside of the cross bar.</p>

<p>Sunderland were still chasing shadows and Arsenal doubled the lead after
15 minutes when Phillipe Senderos managed to wrong-foot Craig Gordon.
While the two early goals made for a decent atmosphere (&#8216;You&#8217;re just a
small town in Scotland&#8217;), I was starting to fear the worst for Roy
Keane&#8217;s Sunderland.</p>

<p>The onslaught continued and the unfortunate Diaby had another goal ruled
out for offside. He had also netted just after the award of the free
kick for the opening goal.</p>

<p>Thankfully, against the run of play, somehow Sunderland managed to
conjure a goal out of nothing before half-time when Almunia (dodgy dyed
hair) blocked a shot which fell nicely for Wallace who scored.</p>

<p>Urged on by the tremendous away support, unbelievably Sunderland
equalised early in the second half when a powerful Jones header squirmed
under Almunia&#8217;s (dodgy keeper) body into the net.</p>

<p>Arsenal increased the tempo to regain the lead and maintain their lead
at the top of the table. The Arsenal fans started to get restless. Toure
nearly broke a post with a powerful drive from 30 yards. The young, pacy
Theo Walcot came on as substitute and also struck the woodwork.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, just when I thought Sunderland might hang on for a point,
Robin van Persie latched on to a Walcott cross with a quick finish to
ensure justice was done.</p>

<p>Having just recovered from Noble&#8217;s recent assault at West Ham, Alexander
Hleb was caught by a late, late challenge which earned McShane a red
card and prompted a rare spark of humour from the Arsenal fans (&#8216;just
like your manager&#8217;).</p>

<p>Attendance: 60,098</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I went to see &#8217;<a href="http://www.controlthemovie.com/">Control</a>&#8217; last night
which is a film directed by Anton Corbijn about the life of Ian Curtis,
lead singer with Joy Division.</p>

<p>The film is based on the book &#8216;Touching From A Distance&#8217; by Curtis&#8217;
wife, Debbie and is as much about the disintegration of Curtis&#8217; marriage
when he embarks on an affair with a music journalist, Anikk Honore, as
the story of Joy Division.</p>

<p>The film was brilliant and, in particular, Sam Riley&#8217;s performance as
Ian Curtis was exceptional. The visual likeness was uncanny, the
butterfly dancing, the eyes, the clothes, even the way he clutches the
microphone. Everything about Riley&#8217;s performance was perfect.</p>

<p>Even the voice. Much to my surprise, the actors even play instruments
and sing on the live performances in the film and John Cooper Clarke
makes an appearance reciting &#8216;Chickentown&#8217;.</p>

<p>If you are a Joy Division fan, the story is well known. Joy Division are
formed after the band see the Sex Pistols play The Free Trade Hall in
Manchester. Ian Curtis, working at the employment exchange, joins as a
singer. The band are championed by Tony Wilson and managed by Rob
Gretton.</p>

<p>Ian Curtis then develops epilepsy and his health deteriorates as he
struggles to control his condition with various medications. Curtis
takes his own life in May 1980 on the eve of an American tour.</p>

<p>There was some poetic license in the film; Tony Wilson faints in a pub
after signing the Joy Division contract in blood and Ian Curtis sees a
girl have a epileptic fit at work who subsequently dies - the origin of
&#8216;She&#8217;s Lost Control&#8217;.</p>

<p>Annik&#8217;s quote in the film that &#8216;She was scared - of falling in love&#8217; is
at odds with Wilson&#8217;s recollection in the recent
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/09/28/fac51/">Factory</a> documentary
that she was indeed scared but &#8216;because of the lyrics, Tony. The lyrics.
He f**king means it&#8217;.</p>

<p>Thankfully, though the film doesn&#8217;t air Debbie&#8217;s view that Ian Curtis
always had a death wish and believed he would die young although it does
continually show Curtis as the depressed, tormented, angst ridden poet
wearing a long overcoat and a glum face.</p>

<p>The performances of the actors playing the other band members (Sumner,
Morris and Hook) and Rob Gretton are also excellent with great attention
to every last detail and obviously, the soundtrack is superb.</p>

<p>Although the film is told from Debbie&#8217;s point of view (she co-produces
the film), Annik is still portrayed as the glamorous groupie while
Debbie is the housewife stuck at home struggling with a young baby
(Natalie) while the band are constantly touring.</p>

<p>The end of the story is well documented. However, even though you know
what&#8217;s coming, even though it&#8217;s 27 years ago and Ian Curtis undoubtedly
had his faults (the film shows him to be an unfaithful liar), there is
no denying the closing scenes in 77 Barton Road are moving.</p>

<p>Especially when &#8216;Atmosphere&#8217; starts playing over footage of smoke coming
from the chimneys at Macclesfield Crematorium (where Curtis was
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/05/08/lwtua/">cremated</a>).</p>

<p>&#8216;Control&#8217; is filmed in black and white - not pretentious art but in
keeping with Anton Corbijn&#8217;s photographs of the band and the
&#8216;Atmosphere&#8217; video he directed.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;So what&#8217;s Macclesfield like then ?&#8217; - Annik to Curtis.
&#8216;Chin up, Ian. Things could be worse. You could be lead singer of The
Fall&#8217; - Rob Gretton to Curtis as he recovers from a fit at a concert.</p>

<p>&#8216;The experience of being Joy Division was really really funny. No
films will ever show that. We used to have a right laugh&#8217; - Bernard
Sumner - from &#8216;Touching from a distance.&#8217;</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Many years ago, Norma and I bought my son a Formula 1 racing car. The
car cost &pound;230,000 and the wrapping paper cost &pound;47.50. It was really
difficult to conceal the present prior to the big day and the mystery
gift somewhat dwarfed the other presents around the Christmas tree.</p>

<p>No seriously, this particular Formula 1 racing car was actually a
child&#8217;s bed. The racing car was fantastic, tastefully coloured in white
and red with large black (wet weather) tyres and the headboard was the
cockpit.</p>

<p>My son loved the bed too but, as with all things, his interest slowly
dwindled with the passing of time. From being proud and excited to show
it off to his friends, he became a little embarrassed when pals entered
his room and saw his novelty bed.</p>

<p>Finally, he convinced us to replace the bed with some anonymous, bland
divan with a supportive mattress and drawers (instead of gigantic,
silver exhaust pipes) underneath. He kept moaning that he banged his
head on the aerofoil every morning, his legs dangled over the end of the
front spoiler and that he was now 23 years old, after all.</p>

<p>As this was prior to the days of eBay, we advertised the bed in the
small ads section of the local paper. On the day the paper was
published, a gentleman called and expressed an interest and said he
would come round on Friday night.</p>

<p>Friday came and went. The gentleman didn&#8217;t come round. Surprisingly, we
didn&#8217;t get any more telephone calls. Reluctantly, we prepared to take to
bed to the tip as we had not been able to access the lavatory for four
whole days as a Formula 1 racing car was completely blocking the
upstairs landing.</p>

<p>Norma and I managed to manhandle the bed down the narrow staircase where
it perched vertically and precariously in the hallway. Dinner guests
looked perplexed and politely enquired: &#8216;Do you know you have a Formula
1 racing car in your hallway ?&#8217;</p>

<p>Fortunately, the gentleman called again, this time promising to come
round on Sunday. This time, he did come round with his young son whose
eyes immediately lit up at the sight that greeted him in the hallway.
The gentleman agreed to take the bed and he didn&#8217;t even attempt to
haggle me down from the &pound;40 price tag.</p>

<p>The prospective buyer was a builder and, because he was working on a big
job where he wasn&#8217;t getting paid until tomorrow, he asked if he could
pop round tomorrow night with the money.</p>

<p>He was happy to return and collect the bed then but as he had his van
with him, he wondered if he could possibly take the bed now. As his lad
was so excited, I agreed and, with a tear in my eye, I helped him lug
the Formula 1 Racing car outside and secure it on his van.</p>

<p>Off he went, with his lad beaming in the passenger seat, proudly looking
back at his new acquisition, the best present he had ever had from the
best dad in the world.</p>

<p>Inevitably, the builder didn&#8217;t pop round on Monday with the money. Or
Tuesday. So I summoned up the courage and rang him at home. His daughter
told me &#8216;My Dad says he&#8217;s working in Cleethorpes on another big job and
isn&#8217;t coming back. Ever.&#8217;</p>

<p>I fleetingly contemplated tracing the gentleman to his home address and
demanding what was rightfully mine. I thought better of it when I
remembered how the burly builder had broken my middle finger with his
very firm handshake.</p>

<p>Then I remembered the look on his son&#8217;s face when he walked in and saw
the Formula 1 Racing car cunningly disguised a bed, so I put it down to
experience and thought</p>

<p>&#8216;That was the best &pound;40 I ever spent.&#8217;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m confused.</p>

<p>Arsenal are playing like Chelsea.</p>

<p>Manchester City are playing like Brazil.</p>

<p>Manchester United are playing like Manchester City.</p>

<p>Chelsea are playing like Northwich Victoria.</p>

<p>Tottenham are playing like Wigan Athletic</p>

<p>Derby are playing like Watford.</p>

<p>Chelsea players are haranguing match officials like Manchester United.</p>

<p>Emmanuel Adebayor is playing with the swagger and arrogance of Thierry
Henry.</p>

<p>In fact, I am so confused I am taking a day trip (and prawn sandwiches)
to the Emirates Stadium next Sunday to watch Arsenal versus Sunderland.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Enjoyed this BBC4 <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/musictv/factory/">program</a> on
the history of Factory with lots of interviews with Tony Wilson, Peter
Saville, Vini Reilly, Shaun and Paul Ryder, Stephen Morris, Peter Hook
and Bernard Sumner.</p>

<p>So many amusing anecdotes and quotes:</p>

<p>New Order insisted on playing
<a href="http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=4CghX1dKBN0">live</a> on TOTP and,
unusually, &#8216;Blue Monday&#8217; promptly fell down the charts thanks to their
abysmal performance (Sumner&#8217;s appalling vocals).</p>

<p>Martin Hannett&#8217;s unconventional approach to production: &#8216;He used to piss
the drummer off so he would hit the drums harder.&#8217;</p>

<p>Factory lost money on every single copy of &#8216;Blue Monday&#8217; thanks to the
prohibitive costs of the sleeve.</p>

<p>Peter Hook worked as crew at the Hacienda for 10 quid an hour and his
wages were paid by New Order royalties.</p>

<p>The sandpaper sleeve for The Durutti Column&#8217;s &#8216;The Return of&#8217; may have
destroyed the adjacent records but many customers found the record
itself was totally damaged.</p>

<p>A really weird, early
<a href="http://joydivision.homestead.com/pic53.html">photograph</a> of Warsaw with
Peter Hook attired in black leather complete with moustache and cap.</p>

<p>Happy Mondays being dispatched to a heroin free Barbados to record an
album only to discover crack cocaine was freely available on the island.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;Never did any drugs. A lot of people think he did because on some of
the TV performances he looks like he&#8217;s on some sort of drugs because
of his arms but he wasn&#8217;t on any drugs at all. That was just him
losing himself in the music&#8217; - Sumner on Curtis</p>

<p>&#8216;The doctor says to him: &#8216;I want you to be quiet. I want you to take
it easy. No late nights. No alcohol. No drugs. Oh what do you do by
the way ?&#8217; &#8216;Oh I&#8217;m a librarian. No I&#8217;m a singer in a post punk rock
band.&#8217; He didn&#8217;t really have much chance, did he ?&#8217; - Hook on Curtis&#8217;
diagnosis with epilepsy</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The problem with installing
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/09/25/wordpress-23-and-typo/">typo</a>
is that, during the research for hints and tips to get the software
installed, configured and running on a shared server environment at
Bluehost, you Google across like-minded <del>obsessives</del> individuals who
have also successfully installed typo in 30 seconds flat.</p>

<p>These people are technical types who sneer at PHP and lie awake at
night, worrying about Ruby&#8217;s scalability. These geeks tend to be
obsessive characters who have now tired of typo and have subsequently
migrated to a brand new exciting platform called django.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> is a Python Web framework - not
a blogging platform or a CMS - but you could use django to create your
own perfect blogging platform.</p>

<p>Django has a endearing, minimalist administration
<a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/nbrightside/Blog/photo#5114597340304921426">screen</a>
and although the finished
<a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/nbrightside/Blog/photo#5115173497282777954">product</a>
looks like a 1980&#8217;s HTML page or the stripped down WordPress
<a href="http://www.plaintxt.org/themes/sandbox/">sandbox</a> theme, it&#8217;s pretty
impressive for 10 minutes and 100 lines of Python and HTML.</p>

<p>I was going to write a superb article, with lots of screenshots and
poorly formatted code blocks, detailing all the obstacles I overcame
before finally claiming success. However, as always, the very clever
aforementioned people have already been there and done that.</p>

<p>So, if you are interested in installing django on bluehost, consult this
<a href="http://www.bluehostforum.com/showthread.php?t=715">thread</a>. One quick
note: my preferred method of installing into a sub-directory failed (403
permission denied) so I used a sub-domain which worked fine.</p>

<p>For a more generic django tutorial about how to create a project, add
models and templates, read (and bookmark) this excellent
<a href="http://fallingbullets.com/blog/2006/aug/06/wordpress-clone-27-seconds-part-1-40/">article</a>.
This gentleman has a rare combination of technical skills and a
brilliant, light hearted, humorous writing style. His site also serves
as a brilliant example of the potential appearance and functionality of
a django powered blog.</p>

<p>In fact, if I could summon up the time and energy to master HTML, CSS
and Python, I would create my very own unique, stylish and distinctive
blog but I don&#8217;t so I won&#8217;t.</p>

<p>I was about to say there was no Wordpress to Django import utility until
I just discovered
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/django-wordpress-admin/">this</a>.</p>

<p>Am I the first blogger to have more blogs than published articles ?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have upgraded this blog to the recently released WordPress
<a href="http://wordpress.org/development/2007/09/wordpress-23/">2.3</a>. However,
I have deep rooted concerns that the new tagging functionality will
simply overload my tiny brain.</p>

<p>The WordPress upgrade went smoothly enough although the editor now
reports a missing table (wp_post2cat) which is slightly irritating.</p>

<p>Also, I sense increasing
<a href="http://wank.wordpress.com/2007/09/24/wp-phone-home/">disquiet</a> amongst
some long standing, intelligent and loyal WordPress users so I took the
precaution of installing YABP (Yet Another Blog Platform). Please put
your hands together and welcome <a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/typo/">Typo</a>
(powered by a delightful lady called &#8216;Ruby on Rails&#8217;).</p>

<p>Update: The Google Sitemap

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m not normally a sucker for these free, pyramid style, link exchange
schemes to drive more traffic to your blog but as

<p>Now, I must hurry into town and join the lengthy
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6997765.stm">queues</a> at Northern
Rock to withdraw my 1 million pounds life savings. To be honest, I think
this media fuelled
<a href="http://bclc.wordpress.com/2007/09/15/congratulations/">panic</a> is a
little overblown and as I have a contrarian investing style, I have just
purchased &pound;5,000 worth of
<a href="http://finance.google.com/finance?q=LON:NRK">NRK</a> shares at &pound;3.10
waiting for the &#8217;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_cat_bounce">dead cat

currently trading at <del>&pound;2.93</del>, <del>&pound;2.80</del>, &pound;2.69&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I like Robert <a href="http://scobleizer.com/">Scoble</a>. While I don&#8217;t always
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/07/11/why-england-will-win-the-next-world-cup/">agree</a>
with him and I have a love-hate relationship with his laugh, his blog is
worth reading and he posts some varied and interesting
<a href="http://www.podtech.net/home/category/editorial/tech/scobleshow/">videos</a>
but one thing is obvious.</p>

<p>The guy has a real passion for technology and writing. On occasions, he
is subjected to vitriolic comments, hurtful criticism and abuse that is
completely unjustified but he calmly takes it all in his stride and
rarely
<a href="http://scobleizer.com/2007/08/29/wired-tired-linkbaiting-i-wish/">retaliates</a>.</p>

<p>Scoble is a family man and has a lovely wife. Indeed, he is a very lucky
man. As I recall, my wife didn&#8217;t have the forethought and love to buy me
an expensive digital
<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http://www.amazon.co.uk/Canon-EOS-Digital-Camera-24-105mm/dp/B000G2O1OS?ie=UTF8&amp;s=electronics&amp;qid=1189755270&amp;sr=8-2&amp;tag=paradiso&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738">camera</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=paradiso&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=2" alt="image" />
hours before she went into labour. Inevitably, Scoble will be posting
live <a href="http://scobleizer.com/2007/09/13/babys-on-the-way/">updates</a> of
his wife&#8217;s lengthy and arduous labour via
<a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a>. I&#8217;m surprised he isn&#8217;t live streaming
the whole event.</p>

<p>Another &#8216;A&#8217; lister recently admitted to hospital was Dave
<a href="http://www.scripting.com/">Winer</a>. Unfortunately, Dave repeatedly broke
rule
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/06/09/7-habits-of-highly-ineffectual-bloggers/">two</a>,
regaling us all with updates on his state of health.</p>

<p>3 September - The saga begins&#8230;</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;Had to take a break, I got a really bad cold, the flu, not sure what
&#8211; but it knocked me down. I had a fever, nasty cough, wheezing, and
it was getting worse so fast that I went to the emergency room at a
Berkeley hospital, where they gave me something to control the cough
and help me sleep, and today I feel much better.&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>6 September - Our hopes are briefly raised. Don&#8217;t laugh. This is a
disease !</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;Yesterday was the first feel-good day after a horrible bout with
whatever it was that hit me and dragged me under. But Naked Jen, who
said she had the same disease, warned against believing you&#8217;re better
when you start <em>feeling</em> better.&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>8 September - Our hopes are dashed but at least Dave received my email
of support.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;I&#8217;ve gotten email from people who are concerned. Thanks for the
concern. Yes, I have seen a doctor, even went to the hospital to get
chest x-rays. I don&#8217;t have pneumonia. Just a realllly bad cold. A
monster proportioned cold. It attacks everything but my sense of
humor.&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>9 September - My diagnosis is that this is not merely a heavy cold. This
is a life threatening bout of man-flu.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;It&#8217;s been a really interesting morning, in a sick kind of way (that
is, I&#8217;m still really sick, coughing and wheezing, rasping and
sneezing).&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>10 September - Dave manages to summon the strength to type a blog post
with no mention of his health.</p>

<p>11 September - A nation sighs with relief.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;Feeling <em>much</em> better today. Health is beginning to return. I owe it
all to patience, lots of sleeping, drinking fluids, and not trying to
be healthy before I actually am. Today I&#8217;m going to take a 20 minute
easy walk in the sun.&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>Winer by name. Whiner by nature.</p>
