  <div class="entry-content"><p>A minor irritant with uninteresting email cluttering up my Inbox has
resulted in some minor changes to my Web 2.0 first-team squad.</p>

<p><a href="http://akismet.com/">Akismet</a>, the popular and widely used anti-spam
solution, was letting an increasing trickle of irritating comment and
trackback spam through. As I had configured email notification for all
blog comments, this was generating pointless, tedious, worthless emails
that simply had to be deleted. A complete waste of time and energy.</p>

<p>Initially, I toyed with the option to simply disable comments on
articles older than 90 days which accounted for 95% of the spam but
would block authors with valid contributions.</p>

<p>A little research revealed a possible alternative - <a href="http://unknowngenius.com/blog/wordpress/spam-karma/">Spam
Karma</a>. I was
loosely aware of Spam Karma from the footer in Tim Hall&#8217;s excellent
<a href="http://www.oracle-base.com/blog">blog</a></p>

<blockquote><p>This blog is protected by <a href="http://unknowngenius.com/blog/" title="Dave">dr
Dave</a>&#8217;s Spam Karma 2: 23182
Spams eaten and counting&#8230;</p></blockquote>

<p>as well as Andy Beard&#8217;s positive
<a href="http://andybeard.eu/2007/05/akismet-spam-karma.html">review</a> and useful
tutorial on configuring Spam Karma.
Initially, the Spam Karma interface was a little confusing. With
Akismet, you literally set and forget whereas Spam Karma has a
configuration page with a plethora of different options. Anyway, after
deciding to start out with the default, out of the box settings, I just
activated Spam Karma and waited.</p>

<p>Sure enough, the never ending barrage of spam trickled in and the vast
majority were correctly marked as such, valid comments were allowed
through and I couldn&#8217;t detect any false positives.</p>

<p>The moderation mechanism wasn&#8217;t quite as obvious as Akismet which
emailed me whenever a comment was held for moderation. However, Spam
Karma was actually better as moderated comments are held in the Spam
list and can be quickly moderated from there. In addition, Spam Karma
can email a daily/weekly digest summarising recent activity.</p>

<p>I have been running Spam Karma for almost a week now and not a single
comment/trackback spam has got past the barriers yet. A truly impressive
and valuable piece of software.</p>

<p>A few features in Spam Karma I really like:</p>

<ul>
<li>All comments are assigned a score depending on various criteria.</li>
<li>Comments on older articles get penalised&#8230;</li>
<li>&#8230;but older articles with recent (valid) comment activity score
higher.</li>
<li>Instant comments within seconds of viewing get penalised.</li>
<li>First-time commenters are presented with a captcha.</li>
<li>Established commenters are recognised and scored accordingly.</li>
<li>Trackbacks without a valid reference URL are penalised.</li>
<li>My comments score higher than anyone elses :-)</li>
<li>A detailed breakdown of the score assigned to any comment is
available.</li>
</ul>


<blockquote><p>-12.5 \
 0: Encrypted payload valid: IP matching.\
 -2: Browser doesn&#8217;t support Javascript\
 0.5: Comment has no URL in content (but one author URL)\
 -2: Flash Gordon was here (comment posted 8 seconds after page
load).\
 -9: Entry posted 7 months, 3 weeks ago. 0 comments in the past 15
days.\
 Current Karma: -3.</p></blockquote>

<p>I was so impressed I donated $20 to the author and that doesn&#8217;t happen
very often.
Another source of unnecessary email was valid blog comments (albeit much
fewer). The solution for this was obvious. Subscribe to my own comments
feed and read them in Google Reader.</p>

<p>Another source of Web 2.0 irritation was that the Firefox extension for
<a href="http://www.cocomment.com/">coComment</a> broke some of the drilldowns in
the revamped Google Analytics reports so I reluctantly stopped using it.
This was a real shame as coComment was one of these Web 2.0
applications, I actually used on a daily basis.</p>

<p>Again, I looked for an alternative and installed
<a href="http://co.mments.com/">co.comments</a> (yeah I know - it&#8217;s a Web 2.0
domain with an embedded period) which works fine. There is a Firefox
bookmarklet (not an extension) so the author has to remember to mark any
comments posted whereas coComment automatically tracked these
&#8216;conversations&#8217;.</p>

<p>The other advantage of the coComment extension was automatic
notification whenever a comment was added to a tracked conversation.</p>

<p>Again, the solution for this issue was obvious. I simply subscribed to
the RSS feed for my tracked conversations and read them in Google
Reader.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Dear Cathy and Claire</p>

<p>I wonder if you can help me. I recently was asked to host a deluxe
barbeque for some Scottish friends who live in a town called &#8216;Glasgow&#8217;,
near Scotland. I live in London and had stocked up on decent cuts of
meat, firelighters, barbeque coals (impregnated), vegetable kebabs and
fish because some veggie always turns up unannounced.</p>

<p>As my wife is so quick to prepare her lovely potato and pasta salads and
often brings the baked potatoes out before my BBQ is actually hot enough
to start cooking, I took the precaution of stocking up on a few gas
canisters and hundreds of gallons of fuel accelerant. She won&#8217;t mock me
in front of my friends this time. Oh no.</p>

<p>Anyway, I just popped into a corner shop to buy 514 gas lighters, and
guess what. My beautiful silver Mercedes got a ticket from a traffic
warden and then got towed away. In the dead of night, in the heart of
London, those blinking traffic wardens and damned wheel clampers are
still working for their stupid commissions. Can you believe it ?</p>

<p>A friend, Ali Akbah, kindly lent me his black 4x4 Jeep for the jaunt to
Glasgow and it was a long, tedious journey particularly as I wasn&#8217;t
allowed to stop at service stations or smoke for some odd reason. Why -
I was pretty relieved when I finally got to <del>the safe house</del> Uncle
Mustafa&#8217;s house and could use his toilet. I cracked that old joke
&#8216;Mustafa Wee&#8217; but he didn&#8217;t get it.</p>

<p>Some of the very important guests for the BBQ were flying in from all
around the world so I drove to Glasgow airport to meet them.
Unfortunately, as I was so tired from the long drive, I lost control as
I approached the terminal building. Instead of braking, I mistakenly hit
the accelerator and crashed into the front of the terminal building and
Ali&#8217;s lovely, brand new black Jeep caught fire.</p>

<p>Imagine my surprise, when I managed to leave the vehicle and tried, in
vain (and excruciating pain for that matter) to save my 756 Birds-Eye
(100% beef) Quarter Pounders. I felt pretty warm and sweaty and slowly
became aware that was because my clothes and hair were on fire so tried
to grab an ice-cold can of Grolsch from the boot to cool down.</p>

<p>Imagine my relief, when a friendly policeman came to my assistance and
tried to drag me away from the vehicle into the terminal building to buy
me a Coca Cola. I fought with him, pleading with him to help me retrieve
my 128 portions of finest rump steak but no, he insisted on dragging me
away to safety.</p>

<p>To add insult to injury, a Scottish BAA employee then waded in and
started to attack me, raining in kicks and blows, talking in a language
I couldn&#8217;t quite understand. It sounded like &#8216;Whityedaein? Yae dinna
come to Glasgae and mess with the polis, you wee bawbag !&#8217;.</p>

<p>My questions are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Will I make a full recovery from my burns ?</li>
<li>If I rearrange the BBQ for Monday 30 August 2018 (late August bank
holiday), would you both be able to attend ?</li>
</ul>


<p>Cathy &amp; Claire reply:
&#8216;Sadly, I have some bad news for you. Very bad news. You have 90 degree
burns over all of your body. Your medical prognosis is not good. Even if
you survive, you will be condemned to a life of skin grafts, complicated
operations, expensive plastic surgery and you will have to learn to
tolerate extreme levels of pain. You will also be horrendously
disfigured for life. In fact, you are more likely to die than survive,
particularly if the British authorities refuse you any medical
treatment.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;In the unlikely event that you survive, Ali Akbah is not pleased with
the state of his Jeep, the loss of his no-claims bonus and has issued a
&pound;20,000 contract on your life.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;PS. Cathy &amp; myself would be delighted to attend the event if an
alternate host (and venue) can be found. Just so you know, Claire is a
recently converted vegetarian but still eats fish.&#8217;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Seven weeks ago on this blog, I
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/05/15/manchester-city-announce-new-manager/">predicted</a>
that Manchester City would appoint a foreign manager.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;However, I have a horrible feeling in the pit of my stomach that, in
seven weeks, Manchester City Football Club are going to appoint a
foreign manager.&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>I also suggested the name of &#8216;Sven Goran Eriksson&#8217; as the most likely
candidate to be appointed.</p>

<p>Now, seven weeks ago, you could get decent odds from your local bookie
on Eriksson being
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/man_city/6241052.stm">appointed</a>:
100-1 in fact.</p>

<p>So, I put my money where my mouth was even though I don&#8217;t follow Citeh
and decided to risk &pound;10 on a long shot.</p>

<p>However, if you, dear reader, shared my convictions and also followed my
sage advice, please do not waver now. Please do not be weak.</p>

<p>Now is the time to seize the moment. Now is the time to significantly
increase your original investment of &pound;10. Now is the time to be rich
beyond your wildest dreams.</p>

<p>Bet the &pound;1,000 proceeds (all of it) on this accumulator</p>

<ul>
<li>Manchester City to win Premiership, Carling Cup and FA Cup in
2007-2008 (2,500-1)</li>
<li>Manchester City to win Champions League in 2008-2009 (50,000-1)</li>
</ul>


<p>In just two years, you will be 125,000,000,000 pounds richer.</p>

<p>Tell William Hill, I sent you.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When I
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/09/30/from-wordpresscom-to-wordpressorg/">moved</a>
this blog from hosted Wordpress , I submitted the site to Google and
Yahoo! After that, I noted the respective crawlers indexing the blog and
thought no more of it.</p>

<p>I subsequently registered the site in Google
<a href="http://www.google.co.uk/webmasters/">Webmaster</a> and Yahoo! <a href="http://siteexplorer.search.yahoo.com/">Site
Explorer</a> and added a
<a href="http://www.arnebrachhold.de/2005/06/05/google-sitemaps-generator-v2-final">sitemap</a>
to help the robots index my site more efficiently. After a while, it was
clear that Google was responsible for the vast
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/10/30/the-only-search-engine-in-town/">majority</a>
of traffic to my humble blog. Mainly &#8216;one-hit wonders&#8217; but welcome
nevertheless.</p>

<p>Today, while dabbling with various reports in Google Analytics, I
compared the performance of the two major search engines over the past
nine months. <a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/user/files/2007/07/google-small.JPG" title="Google Search"><img src="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/user/files/2007/07/google-small.JPG" alt="Google
Search" /></a>
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/user/files/2007/07/yahoo-small.JPG" title="Yahoo! Search"><img src="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/user/files/2007/07/yahoo-small.JPG" alt="Yahoo!
Search" /></a></p>

<p>The statistics are quite staggering, to me at least. So much so, I have
been moved to include inline images (which took me 14 hours and they&#8217;re
still not right) to reinforce the point.</p>

<p>Over a period of nine months, Google (17,562) absolutely hammers Yahoo!
(413) into the ground.</p>

<p>So then I started to get curious. Why does Google do such a better job
of indexing my blog ?</p>

<p>The standard test I use is to search for a set of keywords from a recent
blog entry and see whether it appears on page 1.</p>

<p>For this test, I used &#8220;under the covers at Wimbledon&#8217; from a post made
last Sunday. On Google, this appeared as the first post in the first
page. I already know that Google is very timely at indexing my blog. If
I post an blog article with an internal link (pingback), my RSS feed of
Google inbound links notifies me instantly.</p>

<p>Here are the Google results. The blog article is the first entry
displayed on the front page. <a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/user/files/2007/07/google-search.JPG" title="Google Search"><img src="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/user/files/2007/07/google-search.JPG" alt="Google
Search" /></a></p>

<p>OK. So now for Yahoo!</p>

<p>Here is the Yahoo! equivalent. Nothing for the actual blog article on
page 1. However, the main blog page is listed which happens to contain a
snapshot reference to the article title.</p>

<p>Which is more relevant ? Which looks a better match for the actual
search terms ? Which one would you be tempted to click on ? Which site
would you advertise on ? <a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/user/files/2007/07/yahoo-search.JPG" title="Yahoo Search"><img src="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/user/files/2007/07/yahoo-search.JPG" alt="Yahoo
Search" /></a></p>

<p>Next, I went to Yahoo! Site Explorer to see whether the actual blog
article was indexed yet. <a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/user/files/2007/07/yahoo-missing.JPG" title="Yahoo tardy updates"><img src="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/user/files/2007/07/yahoo-missing.JPG" alt="Yahoo tardy
updates" /></a></p>

<p>No it wasn&#8217;t. So, an interesting experiment and I am sure SEO magicians
in white hats will arrive promptly to point out the error of my ways.</p>

<p>A footnote : The Yahoo! chart does appear to shows worrying signs of
life from mid-May. The number of daily referrals jump from almost zero
to almost a whole 10 visitors in a single day !</p>

<p>Come to think of it, Live.com (previously known as Dead.com) has also
recently sparked into life, rising from the floor to reach the dizzy
heights of a spike of 3 daily visitors. <a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/user/files/2007/07/live-search.JPG" title="Live Search"><img src="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/user/files/2007/07/live-search.JPG" alt="Live
Search" /></a></p>

<p>Google beware !</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you are the parent of a teenage girl, I have some fantastic news for
you.</p>

<p>Good news - You will never have to purchase an air freshener for your
car again. Ever.</p>

<p>I kindly gave my daughter and three girlfriends a lift yesterday. As
each young passenger boarded, pleasant smells and odours of various
perfumes and fragrances wafted and swirled around the car interior until
it resembled a perfume counter at Boots.</p>

<p>By the end of the journey, as I jettisoned my precious cargo, the smell
was overpowering and I started to feel positively nauseous and light
headed. 15 minutes later, I found myself slumped unconscious over the
steering wheel. Or rather, the police officer did. Thank goodness, I
passed that breath test and the policeman also had a grown-up daughter,
who has just graduated from Exeter University.</p>

<p>Despite opening all windows, the sun roof and leaving the boot open in a
futile effort to defumigate the vehicle, this pleasant smell will
persist for a period of six months, rendering the need for small,
refillable air fresheners that attach to the air vent grille completely
superfluous.</p>

<p>Bad news - the cost savings of the air freshener won&#8217;t make up for the
unspecified and intangible costs of owning a teenage daughter.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This year, like the previous three, we applied in the LTA ballot for
Wimbledon tickets. This year, unlike the previous three, we were
allocated two tickets for Court 1 for the middle Saturday in blazing
June.</p>

<p>I checked the Order of Play on Friday night. My wife asked me who was
playing. I casually replied &#8216;Oh - just some ladies playing pit-a-pat
tennis then Djokovic (Men&#8217;s #4 seed) against Kiefer followed by another
ladies singles match.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Are the ladies well known ?&#8217;</p>

<p>I manfully tried to control my rising excitement and the quiver in my
voice: &#8216;Oh I dunno - someone called Sharapova. I think she&#8217;s the pretty,
athletic one. Tall, blonde hair with long shapely legs who also does
modelling.&#8217;</p>

<p>After a cold shower, I checked the weather forecast, looked outside at
the torrential rain and, for the first time in 23 years, said a little
prayer before turning in.</p>

<p>The day dawned gray and wet. We arrived at Wimbledon, prepared for the
increased security checks. A gentleman in a blazer asked me and my son
to open our coats. An unusual request but, in the interests of homeland
security, we complied. He said &#8216;I&#8217;m awfully sorry, Sir but you can not
wear those T-shirts on Court 1.&#8217;</p>

<p>We looked down at our chests. My son&#8217;s read &#8216;Blog in Isolation&#8217; and mine
was adorned with &#8216;www.nbrightside.com&#8217;. &#8216;Why not ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Those shirts constitute &#8220;ambush marketing&#8221; which is strictly not
allowed by the LTA. Come to think of it, didn&#8217;t I see you two dancing on
stage at Glastonbury last week behind Iggy Pop waving a &#8220;Bring back
Wispa&#8221; flag ?&#8217;</p>

<p>Undeterred, we promptly removed one layer to reveal our contingency
shirts</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;Come on <del>Andy</del> !&#8217; &#8216;Come on <del>Tim</del> !&#8217; &#8216;We love you, Maria !&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>&#8216;That&#8217;s much better, Sir. Have a great day and enjoy the tennis.&#8217;

  <div class="entry-content"><p>During the week I am a boring IT consultant.</p>

<p>However, at weekends, I transform into a massive, dance, trance, garage,
hop-hip, mixmaster DJ, spinning vinyl, entertaining the masses at

<p>No wonder I&#8217;m so tired every Monday morning.</p>

enabled. You may find the site faster but, then again, hyperlinks may

the difference.</p>

<p>Which reminds me of a funny story&#8230;</p>

<p>I am currently working in the North East on an &#8216;escalation&#8217;. An
&#8216;escalation&#8217; is characterised by frequent, lengthy conference calls with
bi-hourly status updates, the phrases &#8216;high-profile&#8217;, &#8216;alternative
technical solutions&#8217;, &#8216;severe degradation&#8217;, &#8216;impacting the bottom line&#8217;,
&#8216;CIO visibility&#8217;, &#8216;options for the weekend&#8217; and the perennial favourite:
&#8216;any progress yet ?&#8217;</p>

<p>Thus far I have managed to resist the temptation to reply: &#8216;No. Sorry.
No progress yet because I have been in meetings and conference calls
since I arrived onsite and I haven&#8217;t even been offered a coffee yet, let
alone actually touched a keyboard.&#8217;</p>

<p>Anyway, I digress. All of these factors combine for a relatively
stressful working environment.</p>

<p>This lunchtime, during a scheduled outage of 15 minutes to stop and
restart Oracle to change a static 9i parameter
(optimizer_index_cost_adj from 1 to 10 for the technically minded),
three highly skilled, overpaid technical people and a project manager
were overseeing this vital, complicated and potentially life saving
modification.</p>

<p>The application servers were shutdown so those pesky users could no
longer use the system. We looked wistfully at a AIX &#8216;topas&#8217; screen
showing &#8216;CPU: 0%, User: 0%, System: 0%, Disk 0%, Wait: 0%&#8217; and took a
screenshot for posterity.</p>

<p>We paused to savour the moment. There was a brief moment of quiet
contemplation and tranquility. Then the DBA piped up: &#8216;Shall we wait for
1 minute ?&#8217;</p>

<p>The DBA then fired up Enterprise Manager. We all doubled checked the
password credentials and the target database. We held an impromptu video
conference call to get approval to press the &#8216;Login&#8217; button.</p>

<p>We doubled checked that password for SYS was secure, non-intuitive and,
err, different for the DEV, TEST, UAT, STAGE, QA, TRAIN and PRODUCTION
environments. Of course, it was. What sort of organisation responsible
for Oracle outsourcing would do anything different ?</p>

<p>The moment had finally arrived. Hours of detailed analysis. Hours of
pouring over Statspack Level 7 reports and query plans. Hours of talking
to the mysterious &#8216;SAN Man&#8217;. Hours of scouring SupportWeb and Metalink.</p>

<p>Hours of investigating helpful (but ultimately unhelpful) suggestions
from people who should not have been involved. Hours of going deep down
into dark rat holes. Hours of early starts, late finishes, no coffee and
plenty of red herrings.</p>

<p>The time had finally come to change the parameter. We stand, poised, on
the verge of greatness.</p>

<p>I broke the tense silence: &#8216;OK. The Oracle parameter we need to change
governs the behaviour of the Oracle optimizer. We are seeing an
expensive &#8216;INDEX FULL SCAN&#8217; on the customer table which generates
million of logical I/O&#8217;s, physical disk reads and brings the database
server to its knees. We are trying to encourage Oracle to use &#8216;INDEX
RANGE SCAN&#8217; on the driving, intersection table instead which is 300
times more efficient.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;We are unable to add hints. We are unable to modify the SQL generated
by the black box so we are going to change a key Oracle setting for CBO.
I have the Change Control in my hands. We are actually going to change
an Oracle parameter.&#8217;</p>

<p>A hush descends. The DBA observes another minute silence and expectantly
clicks &#8216;Instance - Configuration&#8217;. With a little prompting, he clicks
&#8216;SPFile&#8217; instead of &#8216;Running&#8217;.</p>

<p>I continue: &#8216;The parameter we are about to change is called &#8216;Go&#8217;
&#8216;Underscore&#8217; &#8216;Faster&#8217;.</p>

<p>The DBA then scrolls down to the &#8216;G&#8217; section.</p>

<p>There is a period of a superlative 3 second silence followed by &#8216;Sorry -
what did you say: &#8216;Go&#8217; &#8216;Underscore&#8217; &#8216;Fas&#8230;&#8217; followed by three people
(poor project manager) laughing uncontrollably.</p>

<p>The door opens: &#8216;Any progress yet ?&#8217;</p>
