gradually, inexorably climbs up the <a href="http://technorati.com/">Technorati</a>

<p>Excellent subject for a blog. Plenty of interesting, free material on a
daily basis without any need for thought.</p>

<p>So I have decided to follow suit albeit a little late in the day.</p>

<blockquote><p>Day 194. Technorati Rank: 235,668 (23 links from 12 sites)</p></blockquote>

<p>Tune in this time tomorrow to see the impact of my new black beret.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I will stop wasting time evaluating every RSS reader in the universe and
simply revert to <a href="http://www.newsgator.co.uk/ngs/default.aspx">NewsGator
Online</a>. This will help me
to read and enjoy content when I actually have the time and inclination.
This will also stop me being distracted by that insidious &#8216;There is 1
new article&#8217; irritant which just leads to skim reading lots of
irrelevant material in a mindless urge to get &#8216;up to date&#8217;.</p>

<p>I will endeavour to constrain my list of feeds to those that I actually
read and are of interest. The recent introduction of Technorati
<a href="http://technorati.com/faves">favo(u)rites</a> proved to me that this
number was indeed less than 50.</p>

<p>And finally, Cyril. And finally, Esther. I will unsubscribe immediately
from Scobleizer&#8217;s <a href="http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/">blog</a>. I am
starting to feel like a mindless sheep. I know millions read it and
discuss it. I subscribe to it and my eyes see the words but I don&#8217;t
actually read it. He won&#8217;t mind. He has a big enough audience. Baa.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>That&#8217;s it. Enough procrastination. Finished.</p>

<p>I will use Microsoft
<a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-gb/FX010857931033.aspx">Outlook</a> to
manage my email, contacts, tasks and calendar at work.</p>

<p>I will store work related and personal data in the same repository.</p>

<p>I will not store any data on a Web based service.</p>

<p>I will use <a href="http://www.dataviz.com/products/beyondcontacts/index.html">Beyond
Contacts</a>
(from <a href="http://www.dataviz.com/">DataViz</a>) to synchronise my contacts,
tasks and calendar to my aging but perfectly adequate monochrome <a href="http://euro.palm.com/uk/en/products/palmvx/index.html">Palm
Vx</a>.</p>

<p>I will either use old fashioned paper and cheap biros from leading hotel
chains (I would only lose an expensive
<a href="http://www.moleskine.co.uk/">moleskin</a> and fountain
<a href="http://www.cityorg-pdq.co.uk/acatalog/Montblanc_Fountain_Pens.html">pen</a>)
or the Palm to capture stuff when I am at home, in transit, in a
hostelry or away from my work computer.</p>

<p>I may also send emails to myself from my home computer to work.</p>

<p>I will manually manage my address book on my Nokia phone. This is more
work for me but absolutely necessary because I dislike the Nokia <a href="http://www.nokiausa.com/support/pcsuite/main.html">PC
Suite</a> program so
intensely.</p>

<p>I will capture my personal finances in <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/uk/homepc/money/default.mspx">Microsoft
Money</a>.</p>

<p>I will continue to use <a href="http://www.tiddlywiki.com/">TiddlyWiki</a> (in
preference to
<a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-gb/FX010858031033.aspx">OneNote</a> and
<a href="http://www.evernote.com/en/">EverNote</a>) to capture personal notes,
jottings and information mainly because I like the sound of &#8216;reusable
non-linear personal web notebook&#8217; and it fits on a memory stick.</p>

<p>I will continue to keep <a href="http://www.joomla.org/">Joomla</a> in my thoughts.</p>

<p>I will no longer mock my wife for keeping lots of lists; &#8216;The only thing
you need now is a list telling you where all your lists are&#8217;.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A kind gentleman (on The Chameleons
<a href="http://forums.thechameleons.com/">forums</a>) once reviewed
&#8217;<a href="http://www.interpolnyc.com/">Interpol</a>&#8217;s &#8216;Antics&#8217; thus:</p>

<blockquote><p>No thanks. If I want to listen to <a href="http://andycowl.googlepages.com/">Joy
Division</a>, I will put &#8216;Unknown
Pleasures&#8217; on.</p></blockquote>

<p>A worthy review which introduced me to one of my favourite bands.
He also followed up more recently by reviewing &#8216;The Back Room&#8217; by <a href="http://www.editorsofficial.com/">The
Editors</a> as follows:</p>

<blockquote><p>No thanks. If I want to listen to Interpol, I will put &#8216;Antics&#8217; on.</p></blockquote>

<p>The jury is still out on this one but worth listening to, I think.
Thanks again.
I am currently poised waiting for his thoughts on the <a href="http://www.arcticmonkeys.com/">Arctic
Monkeys</a>. However, worringly, he has been
a little quiet of late. I wonder if he got a job with NME.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>No - not another &#8216;poem&#8217; from an angst ridden, lovesick teenager
listening to Joy Division and Morrissey.</p>

<p>Two months after Christmas, I finally got around to playing &#8216;X&amp;Y&#8217; by
Coldplay. As I suspected, this is pure dinner party music but the
singles are pleasant enough on the radio when driving.</p>

<p>Chris Martin seems well intentioned but there is something unsettling
about his intentionally unkempt hair, his children&#8217;s names and the
plethora of multi-coloured wrist and finger
<a href="http://www.inet.hr/~anvrzina/Coldplay.jpg">bands</a> he wore at Live 8.</p>

<p>My &#8216;Early Doors&#8217; DVD&#8217;s also sits unopened, pristine in shrink wrap but
will get used on the next business trip abroad (now that United&#8217;s season
is over).</p>

<p>At least my main present from Father Christmas, a spiral bound UK road
atlas, has made it to the back seat of my car but also lies unopened as
yet. The main reason for this was that Pages 38/40 mysteriously
disappeared from its predecessor. Not a major problem until you are
asked to travel, at short notice, to a client in Aldershot. Page 38
encompasses the Camberley-Fleet-Aldershot Bermuda triangle.</p>

<p>Next year, I really must follow Peter Scott&#8217;s example and ask for a
<a href="http://pjs-random.blogspot.com/2005/12/i-suppose-i-should-be-working.html">goat</a>
for someone who really needs it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Important message to all you bloggers contemplating a migration to
WordPress.com.</p>

<p>Google has just launched Google <a href="http://pages.google.com/">Pages</a> - a
Web site builder with lots of &#8216;Looks&#8217; and &#8216;Layouts&#8217; available to choose
from and a nice, friendly easy to use WYSIWYG interface.</p>

<p>Like all Web 2.0 applications, it is still a beta version.</p>

<p>However, this seems an odd product to launch in 2006. As Mark E. Smith
once said &#8216;Are you still doing what you did 5 years ago - Yeah ? Well -
don&#8217;t make a career out of it&#8217;.</p>

<p>Here is my <a href="http://andycowl.googlepages.com/home">effort</a> to show you
what is possible with minimal effort and no knowledge of HTML
whatsoever.</p>

<p>If you like my style, I am available at evenings and weekend for
commissions.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In a previous life, I was a development DBA. Sorry that&#8217;s not quite
true. My job title was &#8216;Persistence Architect&#8217; for a J2EE application.
The Oracle database wasn&#8217;t really considered to be a database. In fact,
it wasn&#8217;t even considered to be a repository either. The database was
merely a means of persisting objects.</p>

<p>There was a swear box for the terms &#8216;Table&#8217;, &#8216;Column&#8217;, &#8216;Database&#8217;,
&#8216;record, &#8216;schema&#8217;, &#8216;SELECT&#8217; and bizarrely, &#8216;PMON&#8217;. This meant I had to
resurrect the word &#8216;tuple&#8217;.</p>

<p>Anyway, I was responsible for the production system which was lightly
loaded and adequately configured so life was easy and I could blog and
surf all day. Well, actually I couldn&#8217;t because I didn&#8217;t blog back then
and I was behind a corporate firewall so I just had some EJB&#8217;s and the
complete Oracle 9i documentation set for company.</p>

<p>One Friday, a developer came along and asked me to restart the DEV
database. I asked &#8216;Why ?&#8217;. He replied &#8216;Because it is the second Friday
in the month&#8217;. I asked &#8216;Why ?&#8217;. &#8216;Because we restart it every two weeks
at Friday lunchtime&#8217;. &#8216;Why ?&#8217;. &#8216;Because that&#8217;s what Bryan used to do&#8217;
&#8216;Why ?&#8217;. &#8216;To fix the Oracle bug where we can&#8217;t instantiate any more
objects&#8217;. &#8216;What Oracle bug ?&#8217;. &#8216;Look - I really don&#8217;t know - some stupid
low level Oracle error. Please just restart it&#8217;.</p>

<p>Ten minutes investigations revealed he was indeed speaking the truth.
The Oracle listener was failing with &#8216;Unable to fork process&#8217; due to a
lack of resources. Just like the objects, database connections were also
persisted. This was a development Solaris server with lots of components
co-hosted with 2 CPU, 512 MB memory and a paltry 128 MB swap space.
Configured more swap space, ordered more memory. Job done.</p>

<p>Everyone was happy. All objects could be instantiated successfully and I
didn&#8217;t have to set a fortnightly reminder to restart Oracle on Friday
lunchtime.</p>

<p>So, I was able to return to the &#8216;Concepts&#8217; guide and my status was
elevated from &#8216;quiet man in corner&#8217; to &#8216;Hero&#8217;.</p>

<p>A couple of months later, I was asked to look into the &#8216;appalling lack
of performance scalability&#8217; of the database on UAT. Apparently, during
load tests, the J2EE application could only process 800 transactions per
hour. Well, they weren&#8217;t actually conventional database transactions but
rather complex, involved business processes.</p>

<p>UAT had a 128 MB buffer cache and a 1 GB shared pool. Odd. The shared
pool was littered with lots of almost identical SQL statements with
embedded literals. I suspect the shared pool was originally 128 MB, the
library cache hit ratio was low and some performance tuning wizard
(human or otherwise) recommended &#8216;Low library cache hit ratio means
increase shared pool immediately&#8217;. Repeat ad infinitum.</p>

<p>I summoned up the courage and talked to the developers. &#8216;Would it be
possible to modify the application to use bind variables ?&#8217; &#8216;No. Listen.
We just use objects. We don&#8217;t make database calls&#8217;. Some more
investigations. The J2EE application uses TopLink which is an interface
layer translating the objects into database accesses.</p>

<p>I decided to read the TopLink manual and suggested setting the TopLink
configuration parameter &#8216;should-bind-all-parameters&#8217; to True and repeat
the test. While the development team made the changes, I reduced the
shared pool to 128MB and increased the buffer cache to 1GB.</p>

<p>Repeat test. Staggering improvement to over 3,000 &#8216;transactions&#8217; per
hour.</p>

<p>My status is immediately elevated to &#8216;demigod&#8217;. Why, they were so
grateful, a Java developer finally divulged the proxy they were all
using to access the internet.</p>

<p>I created my own private swear box for the terms &#8216;EJB&#8217;, &#8216;J2EE&#8217;,
&#8216;Container Managed Persistence&#8217;, &#8216;multiple inheritance&#8217;, &#8216;classes&#8217;,
&#8216;methods&#8217;, &#8216;destructors&#8217; and &#8216;Persistence Architect&#8217; and returned to
quietly reading the fine Oracle manuals.</p>
