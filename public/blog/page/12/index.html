  <div class="entry-content"><p>UEFA&#8217;s decision to ban Arsenal&#8217;s Eduardo for two matches after diving in
a Champions League qualifier creates a precedent, a very dangerous
precedent. This may well result in revisionism, the rewriting of
football history and airbrushing Ashley Cole out of the 2003 Shoot
Soccer Annual.</p>

<p>I forecast the following events which will have unexpected and dire
repercussions for the game:</p>

<ul>
<li>Mexico 1986. Maradona&#8217;s infamous &#8216;Hand of God&#8217; goal is ruled out and
England win the World Cup. The finest football anthem ever, Baddiel
and Skinner&#8217;s &#8216;Three Lions&#8217; never gets written; &#8216;Ten years of hurt&#8217;
just doesn&#8217;t scan.</li>
<li>The award of Wayne Rooney&#8217;s penalty that halted Arsenal&#8217;s unbeaten
run is declared &#8216;unsafe&#8217;. Arsenal&#8217;s &#8216;Invincibles&#8217; subsequently
extend their unbeaten run by a further 20 matches. Fanzine writers
universally rejoice at &#8216;The Immortal 69&#8217;ers&#8217;.</li>
<li>Chelsea, Arsenal and Liverpool mount a joint appeal against
Cristiano Ronaldo. UEFA reduce his tally of 84 goals in 196
Premiership appearances to just 3 goals in 27 starts for
&#8216;simulation, posturing and ball hogging.&#8217; UEFA conduct a detailed
simulation of their own using Championship Manager on networked
PS3&#8217;s. United are relegated and jostle for top spot with
<a href="http://nbrightside.com/blog/2007/05/02/in-memoriam">Leeds</a> in
Division One</li>
<li>Richard Dunne of Manchester City receives a lifetime ban for
attempting to &#8216;deceive a referee&#8217; by impersonating a Premiership
footballer. Questions are also raised in betting circles at his
general ineptitude yet contrasting displays of brilliant, solid
defending in every single Manchester derby.</li>
<li>Gerard Houlier is sectioned under the mental Health Act before he
utters the immortal words &#8216;Ten games from greatness&#8217;. He watches
&#8216;Pink Panther&#8217; incessantly and practises violent martial arts with
William
<a href="http://nbrightside.com/blog/2008/02/26/top-premiership-star-sectioned">Gallas</a>
every Thursday. Later appears in a cameo in &#8216;Kill Bill Vol. 2&#8217;.
Currently in rehab and guesting on &#8216;Soccer Saturday&#8217; alongside Phil
Thompson.</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>On Saturday night, BBC2 broadcast a
<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/comedy/2009/08/ricky-gervais-a-night-at-the-office.shtml">retrospective</a>
on &#8216;The Office&#8217; and broadcast all of Series 1 together with soundbites
from the creators (Ricky Gervais, Stephen Merchant), the cast (Martin
Freeman, Mackenzie Crook, Lucy Davis) and celebrity fans (Ben Stiller,
Christopher Guest, Matthew Perry, David Baddiel, Richard Curtis).</p>

<p>My favourite episode of Series 1 is &#8216;Staff Training&#8217; for all the normal
reasons and for this rendition of &#8216;Free love on the free love freeway&#8217; -
I just love the harmonising from Gareth at 1:24 (&#8216;She&#8217;s not dead&#8217;).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Virgin Media email has been
<a href="http://status-cable.virginmedia.com/vmstatus/serviceissue.do?ticket=1066470">down</a>
for 48 hours and counting&#8230;</p>

<p>I am not looking forward to explaining this (again) to Norma tonight.
She seems to hold me personally responsible and keeps asking &#8216;What is
wrong, why haven&#8217;t they got in touch, why is it taking so long to fix it
and when is it going to be fixed ?&#8217;</p>

<p>This is a complete CRM disaster from Virgin Media. No meaningful updates
in over 2 days.</p>

<p>Can you imagine the fuss in the blogosphere if Gmail was down for just a
couple of hours ?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Obvious really. The FA and the police should have seen the
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/w/west_ham_utd/8221590.stm">disorder</a>
at last night&#8217;s Carling Cup tie between West Ham and Millwall coming.</p>

<p>Nothing to do with East End rivalry. Nothing to do with Millwall&#8217;s
notorious hooligan element.</p>

<p>The problems were started by lengthy queues at all
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/london/8217499.stm">cashpoints</a>
in the vicinity of Upton Park before kick-off. None of these

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Most of the Australians I met on my recent holiday were brilliant
people; friendly, welcoming, great company and most possessed a very
British style sense of humour.</p>

<p>However, there was one element of my Australian experience that was
slightly irritating; the tendency for people to ask questions. For
example, if you ever purchased goods in a shop using a card, you were
immediately greeted with &#8216;Credit or savings ?&#8217;</p>

<p>Another fine example was the following exchange one early morning at
Brisbane airport where I attempted the seemingly simply task of
purchasing four hot drinks as we waited for a short flight to Hamilton
Island.</p>

<p>&#8216;Good morning - Aaaahhh yaaah gaawwnn ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Good morning. Well, we&#8217;re going to Hamilton Island for three days. It
should be fantastic.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Naah - I said &#8216;How are you going ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;We&#8217;re flying - how do you think we&#8217;re getting there - kayaking ? Plus,
we&#8217;re in an airport. That&#8217;s a rather obvious clue.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No worries. What can I git yer ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;A tea, a coffee and two hot chocolates, please.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What sort of tea ?</p>

<p>&#8216;Err - what have you got ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Green Tea, Liptons Tea, Earl Grey, Camomile Tea, English Breakfast,
Iced Tea, Ass&#8230;&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;English Breakfast would be great. Thanks.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What size tea ?&#8217;</p>

<p>What sizes are there ?</p>

<p>&#8216;Small, regular, large.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;OK - small please. Thanks.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What else did you want ?&#8217;</p>

<p>A coffee and two hot chocolates, please.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What sort of coffee ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What have you got ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Flat white, latte, mocha, frapp&#8230;&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh Latte, please.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What size latte ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Small, please.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What else did you say again ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Just two hot chocolates please, Two small hot chocolates, please.
That&#8217;s all thanks.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Do you want sprinkles ?&#8217;</p>

<p>Now this question threw me a little. I looked back towards where the
family were sitting at Gate 3. I saw much tapping of fingers, much
looking at watches and much feigning of dying of thirst.</p>

<p>Inevitably, Norma was busy doing what she does best whenever she is
located in an airport - busy reviewing the shopping facilities ready to
conquer the world with her very own, embryonic &#8216;Worldwide airport
shopping and duty free outlets&#8217; blog.</p>

<p>Worse, one of the people who had requested a hot chocolate was also
doing what she does best whenever she is located in an airport terminal
- busy reviewing the toilet facilities ready to conquer the world with
her very own &#8216;People who have visited the toilets at Brisbane airport
(domestic terminal just outside gate 7)&#8217; group on Facebook.</p>

<p>Now I had to think quickly, very quickly. People behind me were sighing
and saying &#8216;Ah, mate, just get a bloody move on , will ya ?&#8217; in a very
un-British way.</p>

<p>I gestured frantically to Norman Junior III, sprinkling fictious
sprinkles over a fictitious hot chocolate drink and raising my thumb up,
smiling then turning my thumb down, frowning.</p>

<p>He looked rather quizzically and mouthed &#8216;She&#8217;s in the shop&#8217;. I
re-doubled my efforts and repeated my sprkinkling gestures.</p>

<p>He looked rather quizzically and mouthed &#8216;She&#8217;s in the toilet.&#8217;</p>

<p>I gave up my charades, ignored the laughter behind me and turned back to
the assistant.</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes please. Sprinkles on both.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Marshmallows ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Sorry ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Marshmallows ? Do you want marshallows on the hot chocolates ?&#8217;</p>

<p>By now, I was feeling I was the victim of some cruel joke and an Aussie
version of Jeremy Beadle was going to jump out clutching a microphone.
Either that or I was taking part in the Two Ronnies&#8217; legendary &#8216;Fork
Candles&#8217; sketch.</p>

<p>This endless interrogation was getting ridiculous but I resumed my mime
act and frantically tried to get a response from Norman Junior III.</p>

<p>I decided to re-enact the famous scene from Ghostbusters where
Marshmallow man strides all over the New York skyscrapers but he just
looked quizzically and mouthed &#8216;Can I have a muffin ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes please. Marshmallows on both hot chocolates.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Is that all, mate ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Would you like me to go over your order ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Well, no - I&#8217;d rather you got on and dispensed the drinks as my flight
will be boarding soon&#8217; but I contented myself with &#8216;Yes, please.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;So, you want small latte, small English Breakfast, two small hot
chocolates with sprinkles and marshmallows ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes, yes - that&#8217;s correct. Thanks.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Can I get anything else for you today ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No thanks. That&#8217;s all.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;And how are you going to be paying today ?&#8217;</p>

<p>I briefly about offering plastic but quickly find $20 to avoid the
inevitable &#8216;Cheque or savings&#8217; interrogation.</p>

<p>Finally, the torture is over. I wait in the line for five minutes and
the drinks are finally served. I grab the drinks and am looking around
for a plastic stirrer.</p>

<p>&#8216;Are you the guy who asked for &#8216;Small&#8217; ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Err, yes.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Didn&#8217;t you realise we don&#8217;t do &#8216;Small&#8217; any more - since July 25th, in
fact ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Err, no - I just ordered four hot drinks.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yeah, well Eileen should have told ya. It&#8217;s Regular or Large now. Only.
No Small any more.&#8217;</p>

<p>By now, I&#8217;d had enough. I decided to turn the tables.</p>

<p>&#8216;Have you got a tray, please ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Listen, I&#8217;ve given you four Regulars but I&#8217;ve only charged you for four
Smalls.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh - that really is most kind. How can I ever thank you enough ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Full sized tray or cardboard holder ?&#8217;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Most companies I viist have a (subsidised) coffee shop so I am used to

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have followed the
<a href="http://nbrightside.com/blog/2006/09/29/google-reader-gets-revamp">development</a>
of Google Reader since it was
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2005/10/10/google-reader/">launched</a> in
2005.</p>

<p>Having used Thunderbird and then NetVibes, I have
<a href="http://nbrightside.com/blog/2007/02/18/resisting-the-lure-of-google-reader">used</a>
Google Reader for the last two years to read blogs. The main reason I
like Reader are the UI, the keyboard shortcuts for quick navigation and
the fact I can also use it on mobile devices and multiple computers.</p>

<p>During that period, I have sporadically marked articles that interest,
amuse or shock me on my &#8217;<a href="http://nbrightside.com/blog/2007/02/21/how-to-display-google-shared-items-on-wordpress">Shared
Items</a>&#8217;
feed and Google recently added improved support for the sharing of
&#8216;Shared Items&#8217;.</p>

<p>I normally try to use &#8216;Share With Note&#8217; and annotate the entry as to why
I found it noteworthy and I also mark items with a &#8216;Star&#8217; as a private
bookmark; normally as &#8216;To read later&#8217; or &#8216;Possible input for blog&#8217;.</p>

<p>Google have recently
<a href="http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2009/07/following-liking-and-people-searching.html">improved</a>
the sharing of &#8216;Shared Items&#8217;. Happily for Google, the timing of these
new these features just happened to coincide with FriendFeed&#8217;s
acquisition by FaceBook which prompted much fear, uncertainty and doubt
amongst the FriendFeed community, some of whom are looking for viable
alternatives if FriendFeed development comes to a halt (or worse, the
service closes).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.louisgray.com/live/2009/08/conversations-on-google-reader-shared.html">Louis
Gray</a>
and <a href="http://regulargeek.com/2009/08/20/a-more-serious-look-at-google-reader/">Rob
Diana</a>
have both adopted Google Reader which has helped to spark interest in
the service and Google is already making additional tweaks and
improvements in response to user feedback.</p>

<p>Personally, I have started to develop (yet another) network of people
sharing content of interest and already I can see a change in the way I
consume content in Google Reader. Firstly, I scan the &#8216;Shared Items&#8217; of
my group and I tend to find that, by the time, I get to my conventional
list of feeds, most of the articles of interest have already been
brought to my attention eariler by the &#8216;Shared Items&#8217;.</p>

<p>However, there is a problem with de-duplicated posts and even with 50
&#8216;Friends&#8217; managing the signal to noise ratio promises to be an issue.
The social features are relatively new and there are a few rough edges
in Google Reader (people keep getting dropped from &#8216;Groups, people can&#8217;t
comment on an article without being a member of a group) but for me,
Google Reader has the potential to supplant FriendFeed as it focusses on
the content (news, blogs etc) that interests me (rather than LOLcat
pictures).</p>

<p>I also believe annotated shared items are much more valuable and than a
plain, old, tired, outdated
<a href="http://nbrightside.com/blog/2006/08/09/wheres-your-blogroll">blogroll</a>.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s my feed of &#8217;<a href="https://www.google.com/reader/shared/08375973873450584543">Shared
Items</a>&#8217;. If
you use Google Reader, it would great if you could share your &#8216;Shared
Items&#8217; feed in the comments below as I would be genuinely interested in
seeing what you&#8217;re currently reading and <strong>enjoying</strong>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Early Jurassic - Mum takes you to playgroup, kicking and screaming and
your friends are forced upon you. Free milk at 11 am.</p>

<p>Cretaceous - Primary school. You go round to Robert&#8217;s for tea and Robert
comes round to your house for tea. Painfully shy in female company.</p>

<p>Middle Monolithic - Secondary school - you hang out with the kids who
play football and avoid those who threaten you with knives at the bus
stop.</p>

<p>Triassic - Football, gigs, pubs. The best time of your life. With the
best friends of your life. None of them will ever do FaceBook but that
doesn&#8217;t matter.</p>

<p>Late Mesozoic - University - no real strategy here. If someone stands
their round, then that&#8217;s good enough.</p>

<p>Web 0.1 (alpha) - Usenet, flame fests, email using elm on an amber
VT100. Avoid people who use VMS at all costs.</p>

<p>Web 1.0 - IRC is just like a Friday night in the pub. There will be
fights at closing time.</p>

<p>Web 1.0 - surf the internet, send large attachments (amusing photos) to
colleagues every Friday afternoon.</p>

<p>Web 2.0 - social networking. Accept blindly absolutely any friend
request. Approach complete strangers and ask them to be your &#8216;special
friends&#8217;. Friendship isn&#8217;t friendship - it&#8217;s a bragging contest.</p>

<p>Web 2.0 (beta) - Follow Scoble&#8217;s example and be slightly more selective.
Cull thousands of so-called &#8216;friends&#8217; in futile attempt to avoid
information overload.</p>

<p>Web 3.0 - Twitter - the endless, interminable byte stream of inane
drivel. Until Stephen Fry signs up which makes it all alright. Stalk
celebrities.</p>

<p>Web 3.0 RC3 - Finally it dawns on you.</p>

<ul>
<li>People on Posterous mainly like talking about Posterous</li>
<li>People on FriendFeed mainly like singing the praises of FriendFeed.</li>
<li>People on Twitter mainly like talking about Twitter. Repeat ad
infinitum.</li>
<li>People on identi.ca love identi.ca and open source and
<a href="http://andyc.posterous.com/the-single-worst-thing-about-identica">despise</a>
the evil borg.</li>
<li>People in UK tend to have more friends in the UK</li>
<li>You are on first names terms with the developers of Disqus and they
fix stuff - just for you.</li>
<li>If you&#8217;re a keen photographer, try Flickr.</li>
<li>If you like football, seek out people who like football.</li>
<li>If someone Like&#8217;s a post/tweet you wrote, it&#8217;s possible (but not
certain) you will like their outputs.</li>
<li>If someone lives on your road, it doesn&#8217;t mean they&#8217;re your friend.
There&#8217;s a good reason you haven&#8217;t had your neighbours round for
coffee since last Christmas.</li>
<li>If people actively dislike your output, it is less likely they will
be a good friend.</li>
<li>If people say &#8216;Great, interesting, thought provoking post&#8217;, it&#8217;s
likely they are trying to sell you a &#8216;Penis Enlargement Kit&#8217; (or
worse).</li>
</ul>


<p>Web 4.0 - The end of the world. Social Networking dies and we all
adjourn to the pub (again) and play board games.</p>
