  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of the advantages of working away from home is that you are
compelled to seek out exotic locations to follow the fortunes of MUFC
in the Champions League.</p>

<p>Sometimes these exotic locations are abroad. I am currently in the
South of France which is a very pleasant place to be (now that those
pesky riots have subsided).</p>

<p>I have to get a taxi from the French &#8216;Silicon Valley&#8217; to venture into
a real city with real people in order to watch MUFC play Villarreal.</p>

<p>Ideal location. English pub. Almost empty. Barstool free. English
commentary. Barman who can understand &#8216;Une autre bier, s&#8217;il&#8217; vous
plait&#8217;.</p>

<p>Second half. An Irish trio arrive, one of whom who loudly proclaims
(for no obvious reason) that Paul Scholes doesn&#8217;t care any more. Paul
Scholes jacked it in for England as he didn&#8217;t want to travel any more.
Apparently, Paul Scholes loves his family and wanted to spend more
time with his children. Paul Scholes can no longer be bothered for
MUFC either.</p>

<p>Apparently Paul Scholes earns too much money and doesn&#8217;t realise that
he has the rest of his life (after reaching 32 years of age when he
will be &#8216;finished&#8217;) to spend with his precious wife and family.</p>

<p>After a few beers, I am dying to say &#8216;Listen, mate. I couldn&#8217;t care
less if Paul Scholes quit United tomorrow to spend more time with his
family and children. He has given me more pleasure over the last 10
years than anyone. After Roy Keane, he is probably my favourite
player. Personally, I think he might well walk out and offer to play
for Oldham free of charge for the rest of the season but I really
don&#8217;t care. The fact is Paul Scholes is a hero. Paul Scholes is a
Manchester United legend.&#8217;</p>

<p>But, being English, I sit in silence and say nothing.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Lots of memories but not the most obvious (Turin 1999, Viera in the
tunnel, Haaland tackle, Ireland WC 2002 outburst).</p>

<p>Keane&#8217;s words after the 1999 European Cup Final (despite his absence
through suspension) that, after the initial sense of euphoria, he just
felt an enormous sense of anti-climax.</p>

<p>Alex Ferguson also said something similar. Less than 24 hours after
lifting the European Cup in Barcelona, he was already thinking about
next season and the changes that would be needed.</p>

<p>Contrast that with the unnamed United player who said words to the
effect: &#8216;Whatever we do, whatever we achieve, we will never ever
improve on what happened here tonight&#8217;.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last week, I initiated the transfer of the last of my pension funds
into my Self Invested Personal Pension (SIPP). This should be a
relatively straightforward transfer of the Protected Rights element of
a former pension plan. The first step was a response from the pension
company receiving the funds. They need me to fill in a form explicitly
stating that I did not request any financial advice about this
transfer to guard them against mis-selling claims.</p>

<p>It is ironic that the Protected Rights must be transferred into a
stakeholder pension (and not my SIPP) as these contributions were made
by the UK Government on my behalf so it must be entrusted to those
sensible men in grey suits and not invested in the funds of my choice
in my SIPP. Tell that to the people who lost thousands of pounds of
their hard earned money that was supposedly secure with Equitable
Life.</p>

<p>However this is a minor inconvenience compared with the pain, delays,
bureaucracy and sheer incompetence I suffered three years ago. After
twenty years working for various IT companies, I had accumulated small
pots of money distributed across a variety of pension funds. I decided
to consolidate all of these pension funds into a self invested pension
plan (SIPP).</p>

<p>This was mainly so I had direct control over exactly where my money
was invested and to reduce the impact of the management charges paid
to the men in sharp suits. In a SIPP, you are charged for each share
transaction. If you buy and hold shares for the long term, then the
SIPP charges are much lower than a managed fund. In addition, one
significant pension fund was invested with Equitable Life which was in
dire financial straits, subject to a lot of negative media coverage
and was closed to new business.</p>

<p>So I wrote lots of letters, filled in lots of transfer forms, made
lots of phone calls and opened an account with SippDeal. The transfers
of seven different pension funds were all initiated around the same
time (January 2003) and the final batch of funds were made available
for trading in early July 2003.</p>

<p>Once I learned how to play the game (write letters in the first
instance, fill in the required forms promptly, take copies of all
correspondence, telephone in the second instance, get names of the
people you deal with, record the date and time, record what was
promised, get a direct dial extension, keep comprehensive records), I
found that most companies were relatively efficient in handling the
transfer.</p>

<p>However a dishonourable mention goes to Scottish Widows who really did
plunge new levels of incompetence (letters getting lost, faxes getting
lost, people promising to call back etc etc). Maybe I was unlucky but
all I can say is that I am really glad Scottish Widows are not
managing my pension any more.</p>

<p>The SIPP appears to be performing really well as the funds are
primarily invested in high yielding FTSE 100 companies. However, this
may be misleading as the FTSE has performed well since January 2003.</p>

<p>What I should really do is to compare the performance of my
stakeholder (with the PR funds) invested by the wise men in grey suits
against my SIPP. Maybe when the transfer of this latest pot is
complete, I will do exactly that.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In an earlier
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2005/10/29/beware-of-shopping-at-dell-computers/">post</a>,
I moaned about Dell&#8217;s opaque pricing model on their UK Web site.
However, people (especially me) are very quick to moan and complain
but often slow to give thanks and appreciation.</p>

<p>I subsequently contacted Dell Customer Services to complain that the
invoice was for a different amount agreed on the phone (strong case)
and the fact I discovered that I could configure an identical PC for
an even lower price (weaker argument).</p>

<p>The lady from Dell Customer Services initially suggested that I cancel
the original order and simply place another order online at the lower
price. I pointed out that this was a little silly as it would mean
cancelling an order for one computer and adding a new order for a
brand new computer with the identical specification.</p>

<p>In any event, it transpired that the PC had already been dispatched
from Dell to the courier company, so I would have to call a different
department &#8216;Pre Sales Delivery&#8217; to cancel the order.</p>

<p>The gentleman in &#8216;Pre Sales Delivery&#8217; was more helpful and agreed that
cancelling the current order was ludicrous. He offered me a
All-In-One-Printer free of charge. While this was a nice gesture, I
told him I already had a printer. He then offered me a digital camera
free of charge but I already had one of those too. I stood my ground
and insisted on the refund and he finally agreed.</p>

<p>The gentleman also gave me his direct email and the name of his
supervisor in case of any subsequent issues with the refund. So, I am
pleased to say that Dell honoured the lowest price for the PC. It was
inconvenient, took a little persistence and a few phone calls but for
54GBP it was well worth it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There is nothing more tedious than a blog that starts:</p>

<p>Mood: Restless. Currently listening to: X&amp;Y, Coldplay</p>

<p>However I have just burned a CD in ATRAC3Plus format using Sony
SonicStage which contains 15 albums !</p>

<ul>
<li>The Killers - Hot Fuss</li>
<li>Interpol - Antics</li>
<li>Snow Patrol - Final Straw</li>
<li>British Sea Power - The Decline of British Sea Power</li>
<li>The Chameleons - Live at the Academy (2 discs)</li>
<li>Morrissey - Beethoven is Deaf</li>
<li>Radiohead - The Bends</li>
<li>R.E.M - Reveal</li>
<li>Ride - Nowhere</li>
<li>Idlewild - The Remote Part</li>
<li>New Order - Get Ready</li>
<li>Interpol - Turn On The Bright Lights</li>
<li>Nirvana - Never Mind</li>
<li>The Chameleons - Strip</li>
<li>The Fall - Psykick Dance Hall (3 discs)</li>
</ul>


<p>There was even 3MB left free. I don&#8217;t care that ATRAC is a lossy
format.  I am used to listening to bootlegs on TDK 90&#8217;s that sound as
though they were recorded in a bunker.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>Things I like about Wordpress after a couple of days&#8230;
-   The dashboard summary which includes &#8216;Incoming Links&#8217;, recent posts</p>

<pre><code>and comments at a glance. Wordpress also provides? basic statistics
(hits, entry page, referrer). It looks like the data? is
automatically cleaned of spiders and bots so the figures you get are
more likely to relate to actual human beings. You can also remove
hits incurred as part of administration.
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>Being able to easily and quickly define a hierarchy of categories
and tag your posts. I thought that the RSS feed for an individual
category is really good as it means that Oracle types can choose to
only subscribe to that element of the blog (and ignore football,
music and gadgets).</li>
<li>Categories also helps navigation. If someone wrote a gem of an
article two years ago about Linux, you are more likely to be able to
find it using categories rather than trawling through the complete
blog.</li>
<li>RSS feed for comments.</li>
<li>Clean, quick, intuitive, well designed interface.</li>
<li>The post editor which includes a WYSIWYG preview. I used to dislike
the? fact that the Blogger Preview used a larger font so?
sub-consciously I didn&#8217;t view it? as the finished article. The
Blogger Preview, Close, Edit, Preview? cycle required a lot of key
clicks and wasted time. The Wordpress preview is precisely that.</li>
<li>Automatic pings to ping-o-matic (and on to 15 services including
Technorati).</li>
<li>The fact that pasting in text from Blogger preserved the hyperlinks.
I am still perplexed as to how that worked.</li>
<li>Posting seems much quicker compared to Blogger. No more waiting and
nervously watching &#8216;This may take a while if you have a large blog&#8217;.</li>
<li>Indenting quoted text correctly uses the &#8216;blockquote&#8217; tag.</li>
<li>Support for trackbacks and pingbacks as opposed to Blogger&#8217;s
backlinks.</li>
<li>Support for breaking long posts using &#8216;More&#8217;.</li>
<li>The price.</li>
</ul>


<p>Minor things I don&#8217;t like so much
-   The lack of template editing isn&#8217;t a big issue for me. If I was that</p>

<pre><code>fussed, I would use wordpress.org and host it myself. Manually
tweaking HTML templates isn't exactly my idea of fun. What I would
really like though is a Template Editor so you can select which
elements (RSS feed, Comments feed, individual Category feeds) appear
on the main page. My Yahoo! provide something similar to select and
arrange content on the home page.
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>The fact the tagline &#8216;Blog in Isolation&#8217; does not appear in the Pool
theme.</li>
<li>No automated tool to import from Blogger. I think one exists but is
currently in for repair. My blog was only 30 articles so I
laboriously cut and pasted all my blogger articles (and lost the two
comments).</li>
<li>No support for Technorati tags in the post editor but I think I
prefer using Wordpress categories anyway.</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have got an old radio cassette in my car with a aerial mounted in the
rear windscreen. The MW reception is pretty poor and if you go under a
bridge, the interference nearly makes your ears bleed. As I listen to
Radio 5 Live quite a lot, this is rather irritating.</p>

<p>After months of prevaricating and thinking, I impetuously went out and
bought a Sony
<a href="http://www.sony.co.uk/view/ShowProduct.action?product=CDX-DAB6650&amp;site=odw_en_GB&amp;pageType=Overview&amp;category=ICA+CD+Tuners">DAB6650.</a>
This is a DAB radio (with FM/MW/LW as well) and a CD player. The unit
looks and sounds great and I now have access to lots of different DAB
stations.</p>

<p>Although I haven&#8217;t travelled that far yet, the digital sound quality is
excellent, even in towns and under bridges.</p>

<p>The only slight downside is that the CD formats include MP3 or Atrac but
does not include WMA. Unfortunately all my CD&#8217;s are ripped in WMA format
but I have a handful also copied in Atrac format for my Sony MD player.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Dear Reader</p>

<p>We had some great times on blogger together but all good things must
come to an end.</p>

<p>I just feel we need a break from each another. I need some time to
think and some personal space (on Wordpress) and there is no other ISP
involved. Please - believe me.</p>

<p>The Web site hits were bubbling up nicely, the feedburner circulation
peaked at 14 and we even had a couple of people referring to and
commenting on this blog.</p>

<p>However, unfortunately my owner&#8217;s head has been turned by the use of
&#8216;categories&#8217;, an RSS feed for &#8216;Comments&#8217;, trackback links which he
still doesn&#8217;t understand and a new, trendy beta version of a blogging
platform used by the Scobleizer (and Eddie Awad) so he has dumped me
in favour of
<a href="http://andyc.wordpress.com/">http://andyc.wordpress.com/</a></p>

<p>Wordpress automatically provides a feed for the new blog from
<a href="http://andyc.wordpress.com/feed/">http://andyc.wordpress.com/feed/</a>
and a separate feed for comments (which is a nice idea) -
<a href="http://andyc.wordpress.com/comments/feed/">http://andyc.wordpress.com/comments/feed/</a></p>

<p>My owner also deleted and recreated the Feedburner feed despite the
dire warnings (he was too stupid to fathom out the fancy
auto-redirection) so
<a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/AndyC">http://feeds.feedburner.com/AndyC</a>
may or may not still work or you might have to remove and recreate it.</p>

<p>After all we have been through, you still mean a lot to me and I hope
that we can still be good friends.</p>

<p>All my love</p>

<p>I used to go to Old Trafford every fortnight in the late 70&#8217;s and 80&#8217;s
(Stretford Paddock, Stretford End, United Road). Part of the
experience was travelling there, getting to the ground early, securing
your position on a barrier, reading the program, the atmosphere
building, the smell of pies and bovril, the chanting, the opposition
fans, the players warming up, the tension, the goals, the
celebrations, the moaning, everything.</p>

<p>Then I moved away from Manchester and was relegated to a barstool
correspondent and finally a slave to Sky Sports in my armchair. Still,
at least now, I can read the program a full week after the game has
finished.</p>
