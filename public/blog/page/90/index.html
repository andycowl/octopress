  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am worried about those developers at WordPress. They have to eat food,
drink coffee and wear clothes but how are they ever going to make any
money ? There isn&#8217;t even a &#8216;Donate&#8217; button anywhere on the site.</p>

<p>WordPress.com provide me with a hosted blogging platform which I think
it is very good; better than Blogger, better than Bloglines, better than
Yahoo 360&#8217;, better than most of the competition.</p>

<p>The service provided by WordPress costs me absolutely nothing so
represents excellent value for money and I would recommend the service
to any of my blogging friends (if I had any).</p>

<p>WordPress have to provide servers, manage those machines, implement
resilience, scalability and high availability, develop code, do boring
things like backups, testing, fix bugs, worry about the business plan,
buy laptops, S &amp; M (sales &amp; marketing, not the other one) and what do I
give them in return ? A load of feedback (mainly negative) about minor,
trivial things that don&#8217;t work and waste their time whenever I have made
an idiotic mistake (quite frequently).</p>

<p>Now, WordPress are <a href="http://faq.wordpress.com/tag/free/">planning</a> to add
extra features and functionality (customised CSS and templates, more
themes and plug-ins, hosting on your server, statistics) which will cost
money but they have also pledged that the current functionality will
remain free. The sad fact is I am very unlikely to pay them anything for
additional add-on features, ever.</p>

<p>This main reason is because I am quite happy with the existing product.
Secondly, any additional contribution would have to be minimal as I
could pay my ISP an extra 4 GBP per month to add PHP and then would be
able to run WordPress.org with total control over everything. This would
be more work for me but would probably be fun and an interesting
experiment anyway.</p>

<p>Maybe I am not typical, maybe there are hundreds of frustrated WordPress
bloggers out there with cheque books poised waiting for the two tier
service to be announced. For the sake of the freeloaders like me, let&#8217;s
jolly well hope so.</p>

<p>However, last night&#8217;s 2-1 defeat to Benfica in Lisbon just might be.</p>

has produced the first in a series of
<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/rickygervais">podcasts</a> for The Grauniad with
Stephen Merchant (co-writer) and Karl Pilkington (who has a hard time).</p>

<p>The podcast is 30 minutes of chat and improvisation but very funny.</p>

<a href="http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/2005/12/02/guinness-anyone/">trip</a> to
the Guinness brewery reminds me of a similar visit I enjoyed many years
ago with a few friends.</p>

<p>After enduring the 45 minute tour of the Dublin brewery, we finally
settled back to enjoy the free samples which were willingly dispensed in
1/2 pint glasses of sheer perfection.</p>

<p>After a while (seven halves), I sensed the barmaid was about to ask
&#8216;Shouldn&#8217;t you lads be moving on now ?&#8217; but one of our party got in
first with &#8216;Have you not got any pint glasses back there ?&#8217;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In a previous
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2005/11/29/new-regulus-theme-for-wordpresscom/">article</a>,
I wanted to add a trackback to properly cite an article on Ben
Gillbank&#8217;s blog about his Regulus theme.</p>

<p>I couldn&#8217;t find the trackback URL but, as ever, WordPress is doing all
the donkey work for me and now I see my posting does indeed appear as
a comment in Ben&#8217;s original article.</p>

<p>No manual intervention, head scratching or wasted time. Exactly as it
should be.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I quite enjoy the idea of <a href="http://blogshares.com/">BlogShares.com</a>
which a fantasy stock market for blogs. BlogShares places a notional
value on your blog based on the number (and value) of inbound and
outbound links.  Shares in blogs can then be traded.</p>

<p>BlogShares is also useful for identifying blogs by people with similar
interests. For example, most Oracle technically minded people usually
link to Tom Kyte&#8217;s excellent <a href="http://tkyte.blogspot.com/">blog</a> and
their blogs are also worth reading.</p>

<p>However, I am little perplexed as to why BlogShares thinks I have an
outbound link to a Spanish <a href="http://www.lamateporunyogur.net/">blog</a> I
have never heard of, let alone referenced.</p>

<p>I also enjoyed this intriguing disclaimer on BlogShares about the
outbound links.</p>

<blockquote><p>This is a list of all recognised outgoing links from this blog. It
may not be accurate or complete.</p></blockquote>

<p>That&#8217;s a great basis to make investment decisions albeit fantasy ones.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Those nice people at WordPress have opened up WordPress.com to the
masses and added a couple of new
<a href="http://matt.wordpress.com/tag/themes/">themes</a>. I really like the
&#8217;<a href="http://www.binarymoon.co.uk/2005/11/regulus-new-wordpress-theme-released/">Regulus</a>&#8217;
theme from Ben Gillbanks because it looks clear and uncluttered, the
tag line is displayed and the RSS feeds for the blog and comments are
obvious.</p>

<p>The only polite suggestions for improvement would be to relocate &#8216;Blog
Roll&#8217; under the &#8216;Archive&#8217; and &#8216;Categories&#8217; to let the main body text
occupy more of the screen and for &#8216;Message ssage&#8217; to be fixed in the
&#8216;Comments&#8217; section.</p>

<p>Please don&#8217;t tell me that bulleted lists appear in bold. They are not.
Apparently, they are just in a different colour. :-) The author is
kindly going to fix this issue in the next release.</p>

<p>So now my blog has a pretty picture of the vast, infinite emptiness of
the universe and &#8216;Blog in Isolation&#8217; is reinstated. Very apt.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Not a brilliant week if you are a United fan&#8230;</p>

<p>A few years ago, I was drinking in the Chelsea Potter on the Kings
Road and a mate said &#8216;That&#8217;s George Best sitting over there&#8217;. I
replied &#8216;Yeah, right&#8217;. I looked across to the bar and saw a plump,
bearded figure sitting on a barstool, clad in a hideous blue
shell-suit, sipping a Coke. I was stupified. After a while, he
finished his drink and left.  I was still gawping at him like a
lovestruck teenager and I swore he smiled at me on his way out.</p>

<p>Thanks for all the memories, George. RIP.</p>
