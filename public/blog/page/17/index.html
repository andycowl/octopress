  <div class="entry-content"><p>On Saturday, I was lucky enough to get a last minute invite to Craven
Cottage to watch Fulham play Manchester United.</p>

<p>My unexpected treat came courtesy of a friend who works for a
construction company who have 10 corporate tickets at Fulham.
Ordinarily, he would have taken his son but, fortunately for me, the
poor lad was serving the last day of a grounding as a result of a
serious, undisclosed misdemeanour.</p>

<p>We caught the 85 bus up to Putney and immediately caught a taste of the
pre-match atmosphere walking through Bishops Park when we were treated
to the full repotoire of United songs from a solitary, and very
inebriated, United fan. I suspect originally he may have been travelling
down with some mates in a Salford hire van who miraculously &#8216;forgot&#8217; him
at Watford Gap services.</p>

<p>A lady gave us all some fancy passes and a complimentary program and we
were ushered to in a semi-private lounge where we got a pre-match drink
and placed our bets (3-1 United, Berbatov/Fletcher to score first,
Scholes to score last, first goal 30-45 mins). Very civilised.</p>

<p>Shortly before kickoff, we took our seats to find we were sitting
immediately behind the away dugout. After the debacle against Liverpool,
Ferguson had shuffled the pack a little with Ronaldo and Berbatov up
front, Giggs and Scholes in the midfield.</p>

<p>As United had recently destroyed Fulham not once but twice, scoring 7
goals with no reply, I was quietly confident. The United subs (Tevez,
Rooney, Neville) and backroom staff took their places on the bench and
the game got underway on a beautiful, warm sunny day in south west
London.</p>

<p>Fulham immediately started with some purpose and conviction. They were
chasing and hustling United and contesting every ball. Hardly
surprising, but a sharp contrast with their weak, shambolic,
embarrassing performance at Old Trafford recently.</p>

<p>One of the reasons, I love going to matches rather than watching from a
barstool is that you can see everything that&#8217;s going on. For example. I
was interested in watching Dimitar Berbatov. When United signed him, I
confidently told a Spurs fan that his laid back attitude and his
perceived casual approach simply would not be tolerated at United. God,
was I wrong ? Berbatov strolled around the pitch as if he was playing in
a testimonial or a pre-match friendly against non-league opposition.
After 10 minutes, he looped a header over the bar which was his only
meaningful contribution in 45 minutes. Well, apart from tumbling to the
ground as if he&#8217;d been pole-axed when fairly tackled by Simon Davies.</p>

<p>As always, United had a large travelling support - after all this is a
home game for the Surrey and London contingent - and the United fans
occupying the entire stand to the goal away to my right, stood up
throughout and sang constantly and loudly.</p>

<p>Fulham had the best of the opening exchanges and United&#8217;s passing was
badly awry. Park needlessly gave possession away which resulted in a
Fulham corner. From the corner, Bobby Zamora headed goalwards and Paul
Scholes instinctively blocked his second attempt with both hands. The
referee correctly awarded a penalty and dismissed Scholes. Inevitably,
Scouser Danny Murphy expertly converted the penalty and 3 of my 5 bets
instantly went down the drain.</p>

<p>United seemed rocked by this double early setback and Van der Sar was
called into action to deny Fulham. United badly needed to keep
possession and get some inspiration from Cristiano Ronaldo. Instead, we
were treated to yet another display of petulance, frustration with his
colleagues at misdirected or overhit passes, frustration with defenders
who dared to tackle him, frustration with the referee for not giving him
decisions, frustration at more free-kicks blasted into the wall or row
36. In fact, Ronaldo&#8217;s first half performance was on a par with
Berbatov.</p>

<p>United kept trying to get a foothold in the game and shortly before
half-time Patrice Evra advanced towards the penalty area where he was
tackled and he tumbled over, trying to con the referee into awarding a
penalty. Play continued and Evra was booked for diving much to the
Fulham fans&#8217; delight.</p>

<p>Half-time approached. A stony faced Alex Ferguson, chewing gum
furiously, stood up to watch the shambles. As he turned back to the
dugout, I shouted &#8216;Get Berbatov off - he&#8217;s a bloody disgrace.&#8217;</p>

<p>After a quick painkilling pint, the second half got underway. Squad
members, Nani and young Salford lad Eckersley passed in front of me in
suits and ties. I greeted Nani and said &#8216;Hiya Phil&#8217;, who both fleetingly
acknowledged me. Later on, I discovered that Eckersley&#8217;s first name was
actually Richard and not Phil.</p>

<p>Thankfully, Ferguson had heeded my advice and Rooney was on for Berbatov
who presumably didn&#8217;t need a shower after the effort he expended in 45
minutes. I was glad I wasn&#8217;t present in that dressing room as I could
picture tea cups being smashed and the hairdryer treatment being meted
out by Ferguson.</p>

<p>Thankfully, United came out much improved (would have been difficult to
be much worse) and, despite 10 men, managed to keep possession and
exerted some pressure on the Fulham goal. Even Ronaldo had miraculously
stopped the incessant showboating and childish histrionics and
concentrated on playing football (a not so quiet word from Ferguson ?)</p>

<p>Half chances came and went - United were now on top and Fulham were on
the back foot. There was a staggering incident when Fulham cleared a
corner to the half-way line and all 11 Fulham players remained in their
own half, behind the ball, just inviting United to mount yet another
attack. United&#8217;s fantastic support got more vociferous and urgent as
they sensed an equaliser. Time passed and the goal didn&#8217;t come.
Schwarzer pulled off an excellent double save. Carlos Tevez came on.
United kept pressing. 10 minutes left. Inevitably, Rooney collected his
standard booking for tugging at Dacourt&#8217;s shorts in pure frustration at
being dispossessed.</p>

<p>Fulham weathered the storm and with 3 minutes left, United&#8217;s (and my
personal) misery was complete when Zoltan Gera sealed the game by
hooking in a great volley to make the score 2-0. All around, fans went
absolutely wild while I sat rooted to my seat staring at the concrete
floor.</p>

<p>Wayne Rooney&#8217;s a talented footballer and a great competitior who plays
with passion and he obviously cares (c.f. Berbatov) but, after the ref
ordered a free-kick to be re-taken from the correct place, Rooney picked
the ball up and hurled it back. Fortunately, no-one was in the path of
the missile as it could have caused serious injury. Rooney inevitably
collected his second booking to leave United to finish the match with 9
men. For good measure, Rooney pummelled the corner flag on his
inglorious exit.</p>

<p>The final whistle brought an end to the agony. United&#8217;s senior players
still weren&#8217;t finished yet though - Van der Sar and Rio Ferdinand
continued to hassle and harry the match officials after the final
whistle. I have to say the continual petulance, arrogance and general
lack of respect shown by the United players during this game was frankly
embarrassing. In fact, it was a disgrace.</p>

<p>I was obliged to take yet more good natured stick from the Fulham fans
in the bar as we watched the Ireland-Wales rugby.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The latest update in this occasional and very
<a href="http://nbrightside.com/blog/2006/01/13/sports-bars-of-europe">popular</a>
<a href="http://nbrightside.com/blog/2006/04/26/sports-bars-of-europe-2">series</a>.</p>

<p>I am currently working in the delightful city of Bern, near Switzerland.
I have been here a couple of times before and last April I watched
United beat Barcelona 1-0 in the Champions League semi-final thanks to a
great goal from <a href="http://nbrightside.com/blog/2007/05/02/open-letter-to-paul-scholes">Paul
Scholes</a>.
Unusually for me, I watched that game with a colleague. Unfortunately
for him, I don&#8217;t think I was very good company. Well, I mean - who
really wants to discuss whether &#8216;late delivery of the extracts pose a
serious risk to the success of the project&#8217; when you&#8217;re watching your
team play in the crucial second leg of the European Cup semi-final.</p>

<p>Anyway, last night I returned to the same haunt to see United take on
the Barcodes at St James&#8217; Park. The venue for the night&#8217;s entertainment
was <a href="http://www.pickwick.ch/bern/index.php">Mr. Pickwick</a> which is a
sports bar with the obligatory football scarves and photographs adorning
the walls, serving English beer (London Pride) and Guinness with three
large TV screens.</p>

<p>I wasn&#8217;t entirely confident that the United game would be televised as I
knew it wasn&#8217;t being shown by Sky or Setanta back in dear ol&#8217; Blighty.
As I enter the hostelry, it doesn&#8217;t look too promising; football is
being shown but, alas, the TV&#8217;s are only showing &#8216;Young Boys of Bern&#8217;
and highlights from the German Bundesliga.</p>

<p>I confidently order my customary pint of &#8216;Feldschlosschen&#8217; and enquire
if there&#8217;s any chance the United game will be on. The helpful gentleman
behind the bar tells me &#8216;Oh yes - Manchester will be on at 9 o&#8217;clock&#8217;.
He then rather unhelpfully short-changes me by 10CHF which I
successfully challenge.</p>

<p>OK - so it&#8217;s 19:43, the match kicks off at 19:45 and we&#8217;re going to get
the United game in 15 minutes. So I grab a barstool and nervously kill
time, watching &#8216;Young Boys of Bern&#8217; play in front of a very meagre crowd
(10, 758)</p>

<p>For some reason, I find the &#8217;<a href="http://www.bscyb.ch/yb-index.htm">Young Boys of
Bern</a>&#8217; a very amusing name for a
football club. It is also fitting and somehow appropriate that the
&#8216;Young Boys&#8217; play their home fixtures at the &#8216;Wankdorf Stadium&#8217;.</p>

<p>If United hadn&#8217;t been playing tonight, I might have actually gone to see
the game as I have now mastered the (very efficient) public transport
system in Bern. However, the prospect of getting lost and asking a local
&#8216;Where can I find Young Boys, please ?&#8217; was not an attractive one.</p>

<p>At 9 o&#8217;clock, multiple remote controllers appear from behind the bar, TV
channels are switched and we all play musical chairs as we jostle for a
decent viewing position for our chosen match.</p>

<p>To my horror, I see that United are losing 1-0 to Newcastle after
Chelsea and Liverpool both won the previous night. I console myself by
ordering another beer. Ten minutes later, normal service is restored
when John O&#8217;Shea rampages forward (shurely shome mistake here - Ed) and
crosses for Rooney who turns sharply to equalise.</p>

<p>I spot the Newcastle owner, Mike Ashley, sitting in the stand. This must
be his first visit to St James&#8217; Park since he sacked Keegan and necked
that pint in 12 seconds flat for the TV cameras. I sincerely hope the
loud United following greet him with the traditional &#8216;Come to see
United, you&#8217;ve only come to see United&#8217;.</p>

<p>Half-time arrives and, much to my surprise, I see Edwin van der Sar drop
a clanger for Newcastle&#8217;s opening goal. Kind of ironic after his
brilliant, record breaking run of clean sheets.</p>

<p>Newcastle are playing pretty well but United are in control and always
look threatening. United take the lead when Park crosses to give the
classy Dimitar Berbatov a simple tap-in.</p>

<p>Over on an adjacent TV screen, &#8216;Young Boys&#8217; have triumphed 3-0 in a cup
quarter-final. 10 minutes later, supporters who have been to the game
drift in for the post-match analysis and a couple of drinks.</p>

<p>The YB fans are clad in club colours; Yellow and Black - hardly any of
them are &#8216;Young Boys&#8217;, more like &#8216;Middle Aged Men With Beards&#8217;. I am
forced to gawp at one man who comes in with a YB shirt adorned with the
unbelievable slogan &#8216;Young Boys Forever&#8217;. A brave man. I truly hope for
his sake, YB never qualify for Europe and he travels to the away leg in
England.</p>

<p>Better still, imagine if BSCYB were to meet Chelsea in the UEFA Cup next
season. Then we would have the dream fixture - &#8216;Rent Boys&#8217; versus &#8216;Young
Boys&#8217; !</p>

<p>Next fixture: MUFC versus Milan, Wednesday 11 Match. Location: Madrid.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have most of my music available in digital format and have
occasionally pondered the purchase of a wireless streaming
<a href="http://www.slimdevices.com/pi_squeezebox.html">device</a> so I could
listen to music anywhere in the house.</p>

<p>Another possibility would be to upload all the music to my own server
and stream music from any computer using freely available software (e.g.
<a href="http://www.icecast.org/">Icecast</a>).</p>

<p>Of course, both those options cost money and more importantly, time so,
as always, I chose to so absolutely nothing apart from duplicating my
iTunes library on my two main (home/work) computers.</p>

<p>Well that&#8217;s not entirely true - over the years I have had an on-off
friendship with <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/andycowl">last.fm</a>. Last.fm is
a social network which allows you to log music you are listening to,
mark favourite tracks, create and share playlists with friends so you
can use it as a discovery engine. This didn&#8217;t entirely work for me - I
simply marvelled at people&#8217;s shocking taste in music and wondered how on
earth &#8216;Plastic Bertrand&#8217; even appears on the Habari group.</p>

<p>Recently, I picked up on a new music service called
<a href="http://www.spotify.com/">Spotify</a> and scoured the Web to secure an
invite. I was immediately impressed with Spotify - you have to download
a desktop client but after that, you are free to play music - streamed
from their servers. In fact, I think there may be an element of peer to
peer and BitTorrent going on behind the scenes as Spotity does use disk
space on the local PC as a cache.</p>

<p>Anyway, streaming music was hugely impressive - playback was completely
seamless - no stutters, no pauses, no jumps. It was just like playing
music locally in Media Player or iTunes. Spotify doesn&#8217;t have all the
world&#8217;s music collection available on their servers but fortunately I am
stuck in an 80&#8217;s musical timewarp and the vast majority of my narrow
tastes are catered for on Spotify.</p>

<p>I also really like Spotify&#8217;s interface - simple, intuitive and
reassuringly grey. Guess what - you can choose your favourite artist and
then select an album (unlike last.fm that insists on playing your
library in an arbitrary order which is incredibly annoying when you want
to listen to a specific album or track).</p>

<hr />

<p>  <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/F7CRRCV1Y-CjU3UEJHPSWQ?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_l2uGy1RGCiE/SZLs7HikvQI/AAAAAAAAA6g/zqyWF8RJWV8/s400/Spotify.PNG" alt="image" /></a>
  From <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/nbrightside/Blog?feat=embedwebsite">Blog</a></p>

<hr />

<p>So how much is Spotify charging for this wonderful service ? Well, it&#8217;s
free although there are occasional audio adverts spirinkled in between
songs although in my view, the adverts are not invasive (every 5 or 6
songs) and no worse than commercial radio - a lot better in fact. There
are also visual ads in the Spotify aplication, but again, I don&#8217;t find
these too bothersome. If you do, there are subscription options for an
ad-free service although at &pound;10 per month, I think this option is way
overpriced.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s the catch ? Is this illegal ? Isn&#8217;t this Limewire dressed up with
a different interface ? Well - no because Spotify pays the artists and
labels for access to the music so the content on Spotify is legal. In
fact, Spotify does contain some content from dubious sources which is
occasionally being trimmed and removed from the servers as it is
identified.</p>

<p>The good news doesn&#8217;t end there. The labels, bands and A&amp;R men behind
Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, AC/DC, Metallica and The Beatles refused to
share their music so there is simply no way you can ever encounter any
of that dross. Ever.</p>

<p>The only two main omissions that I care about are The Smiths (hears loud
cheering in the distance) and that Beatles tribute band fronted by two
brothers from Manchester - Oasis (hears more loud cheering).</p>

<p>Using Spotify I can access most of my music library from any PC (desktop
or work laptop) and there&#8217;s an option to automatically update last.fm
with tracks played.</p>

<p>Does this signal the death of the music industry and mark my last ever
CD purchase ? Well - no, ironically Spotify has sparked my interest and
unveiled more hidden musical nuggets (&#8216;Entertainment&#8217; by &#8216;Gang of Four&#8217;
to name just one) I had completely forgotten about. Consequently, I will
probably go out and buy now more CD&#8217;s as I also listen to music on my
iTouch and in the car.</p>

<p>Anyway, Spotify is only available in selected countries at the moment
and subscription is by invite only (Google Blog Search is your
<a href="http://blogsearch.google.com/blogsearch?hl=en&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;as_drrb=q&amp;as_qdr=d&amp;q=spotify+invite&amp;scoring=d">friend</a>)
but today Spotify opened up to users in the UK without the need for an
invite.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last Friday, I found myself standing in a short queue at Newcastle
airport. I could immediately discern that the global economic recession
is starting to take hold up in the bleak, industrial North. Normally, at
this time, Newcastle airport is packed with hoardes of Geordie
holidaymakers bound for the Mediterranean and beer swilling lads in
Newcastle football shirts going on a, err, cultural visit to Prague.</p>

<p>However, to my surprise, last Friday, the airport was eerily quiet. No
queue for the self-service kiosk. No queue to check the bag, No queue to
enter the security area. No snaking queues with temporary barriers to
navigate. No smiling, happy, expectant people discussing their fourth
overseas holiday of the year.</p>

<p>In fact, just a scattering of tired, emotional businessmen, pilots and
aircrew passing their bags, belts and shoes through the security
scanner.</p>

<p>As usual, I go to grab my laptop off the conveyor belt and hope my
trousers don&#8217;t fall down. The vigilant lady says &#8216;Brian - get that bag&#8217;.
I sigh as Brian says &#8216;Excuse me, Sir - is this your bag ?&#8217; I own up and
he starts to pull out the various adapters, wires, power supplies and
cables. He looks towards the vigilant lady. &#8216;Is it this lot ?&#8217; &#8216;No -
it&#8217;s round, circular&#8217;.</p>

<p>Brian delves further into the tardis that is my Targus laptop bag. To my
horror, he drags out an empty bag of &#8216;Liquorice Twists&#8217; and a copy of
&#8216;Oracle Magazine&#8217; that I nicked from work. A pretty lady dressed in a
nice trouser suit looks dismissively at me while she puts her shoes back
on. I feel myself start to redden. It gets worse as I realise my
trousers have fallen down.</p>

<p>And, finally, Brian finds it. He triumphantly pulls out a roll of
Sellotape. I have carted this all around Europe and the UK in the
forlorn hope that I would somehow summon up the enthusiasm to do my
expenses in a lonely hotel room. But, of course, I never did.</p>

<p>Vigilant lady scowls: &#8216;Yeah - that&#8217;s it, Brian.&#8217; Brian then quickly
places the almost full roll of high quality Sellotape into an unseen
drawer. &#8216;Sorry, Sir but I am going to have to confiscate that item.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Are you serious ? I have lugged that Sellotape all around Europe for
two years and never been challenged once. In any case, how will I do my
expenses now. You must know that staples are explicitly not allowed by
Section 3.1.2a of the expenses policy. And before you say it, nor is
Blu-Tac.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Sorry, Sir but I must confiscate this item in the interests of
security.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Come on - at least tell me why.&#8217;</p>

<p>Vigilant lady momentarily takes her eagle eyes off the camera and spits
out: &#8216;Because, Sir, that item could be used as a restraining device on
the aircraft. That is why.&#8217;</p>

<p>So, next time, you&#8217;re on a plane and your neighbour reaches for the
overhead locker and pulls out a roll of Sellotape - be frightened, be
afraid, be very afraid because he isn&#8217;t going to simply update his
holiday scrapbook.</p>

<p>That manic psychopath is going to bind and gag you; he is going to wrap
you up tight like an Egyptian Mummy; he is going to wrap you up like a
Christmas present from your mother-in-law (with no air-holes).</p>

<p>Then, he is going to wield you in front of him, advancing forward
through the plane from your aisle seat in 23C, brandishing a roll of
Sellotape. He will then ignore the screams of passengers and break into
the cabin, demanding the immediate release of political prisoners in
Guantanamo Bay and that the plane diverts to Tehran immediately with a
press conference on arrival or you are going to get it !</p>

<p>With the heavy duty duct tape.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Or as New Order once sang &#8216;In a lonely place&#8217;.</p>

<p>Much has been made of Rafa Benitez&#8217;s so-called rant against Alex
Ferguson. Of course, Benitez is correct for the most part but the most
amusing part was when he pulled out a sheet of A4 with the charge sheet.</p>

<p>Benitez is pretty new to this game and he would have been better advised
to speak out after Liverpool had won 4-0 extending their lead and
avoiding the use of the phrase &#8216;mind games&#8217; - particularly when he&#8217;s not
getting involved in them. Supposedly.</p>

<p>Instead, look at Liverpool&#8217;s performance and result at the weekend
(stuttering 0-0 draw at Stoke) and compare and contrast with United&#8217;s
performance (convincing 3-0 win over Chelsea). Now who looks an idiot ?</p>

<p>Of course, Alex Ferguson&#8217;s just as bad - he is similarly obsessive and
keeps his own little black books. When asked for his reaction to
Benitez&#8217;s press conference, he also rose to the bait, claiming Benitez
was &#8216;disturbed&#8217; and you had to ignore the &#8216;venom&#8217;.</p>

<p>How much better would a simple reply of &#8216;You know what - I poured out
another glass of red wine, sat back and just smiled&#8217; ?</p>

<p>Anyway, to yesterday&#8217;s game and Jamie Carragher. He looked decidedly
uncomfortable being asked about United&#8217;s best performance of the season
and he looked distinctly uneasy when asked about Benitez&#8217;s quotes but
what do you expect ?</p>

<p>Would Gary
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/01/26/gary-neville-no-apology-whatsoever">Neville</a>
have taken money to go to Anfield to be a pundit on a crucial Liverpool
game and run the risk of having to awkwardly praise his hated rivals ? I
sincerely doubt it.</p>

<p>Anyway, the most telling remark was when Liverpool&#8217;s vice-captain was
asked: &#8216;So you think Liverpool will be involved in the final weeks to
decide the Championship ?&#8217;</p>

<p>A easy, weak, typically banal question to close the show. Jamie
Carragher just needed to say &#8216;Yeah - we are top. We are playing well. We
have the points on the board. Games in hand don&#8217;t always mean points. We
have already beaten United and Chelsea and they all have to catch us.&#8217;</p>

<p>But he didn&#8217;t. He said:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;Yes. Hopefully.&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>Will this prove to be Carragher&#8221;s
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2008/02/26/top-premiership-star-sectioned">Gallas</a>
moment ?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently I collected Norma-Jean from one of her hobbies. As we departed,
I stopped to bid farewell to a couple of boys who were preparing to
cycle home: &#8216;See you next time, lads.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Dad - why did you have to say goodbye to those boys ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Well I see them here twice a week so I was just being friendly&#8230;&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;God - that was so embarrassing. I actually thought you were going to
say &#8216;Cheerio&#8217; as usual&#8217;.</p>

<p>There followed a brief discussion on the list of all possible farewell
greetings and the acceptability of each. Then we reached the car. She
put her iPod on, I listened to the radio and the matter was closed.</p>

<p>Until the following week. We left the sports centre where the same two
lads were unlocking their bikes. I paused. My daughter stopped and
looked at me in stupefied horror as I waited for the lads&#8217; full
attention.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This week, I have been working in Bergen, near Norway. Normally, I view
my trips to major European cities simply as a means to end and after a
while they all tend to blur into one unified major European city. Same
hotel room, same office, different people, same problems, same
computers, same restaurants with the same cashless transaction
mechanism.</p>

<p>Bergen, however, is different. The city is just beautiful. I love it.
Mountains, water, snow, history. Just stunning. If I didn&#8217;t have ties, I
think I would seriously considering moving here full-time.</p>

<p>Although I flew out to Bergen on Sunday night on a direct flight from
Gatwick, limited availability meant I had to return via Schipol. My
latest commuting story begins at Bergen airport&#8230;</p>

<p>&#8216;Hi - do you think I should check this bag or carry it on the plane ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Its entirely up to you, Sir. I can check your bag all the way through
to London.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Ok. Great. So you&#8217;re promising me that when I reach Heathrow, my bag
will also get there.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Well, we can only hope so, Sir.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;OK. Thanks. I&#8217;ll check it into the hold.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;As you wish, Sir. Now, is there any way someone could have interfered
with this bag or placed items in it without your knowledge ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Well, we can only hope not.&#8217;</p>

<p>As soon as the words left my mouth, I immediately felt a pang of regret,
a twinge of remorse at cracking such a weak joke. This sense of regret
turned into blind panic, and total fear 10 minutes later when I found
myself in a windowless room, buried deep in the bowels of Bergen
airport.</p>

<p>&#8216;Henrick, some new latext gloves, please. Now, Sir, please to be bending
over.&#8217;</p>

<p>Anyway, after enduring the rather extended, lengthy and, err, in-depth
security checking procedure, I arrived in Amsterdam and managed to
navigate from C15 to D24 without further incident. It was quite easy.
You just move your Knight twice and castle on the Kings&#8217; side.</p>

<p>Irritatingly, there was yet another lightweight security check at the
entrance to gate D24. This took forever as the entire population of
China was on this short hop to London and were carrying suitcases,
coats, souvenirs, carrier bags, duty free goods and small, colourful
birds onto the plane rather than use the hold for some reason.</p>

<p>After waiting 25 minutes in the lengthy queue, I didn&#8217;t really want to
be told rather disdainfully by the security guard: &#8216;Sir, are you aware
you need to at the gate 30 minutes prior to departure ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes - I am well aware of that. I was actually here at the gate 45
minutes prior to departure but are you aware I have been standing in
line for 25 minutes because you are so flipping slow ?&#8217;</p>

<p>Finally, I clear security and stand in yet another queue to board the
plane. My boarding card says I am right at the front handily positioned
in seat 2C in the luxury of business class.</p>

<p>Normally, I travel economy which is fair enough as the customer is
paying and the flights are only short hops within Europe. The business
travel flight booking system is similar to the Lottery Balls Selector.
You never quite know how it is programmed or what results it will
produce. Nor can you ever question its decision which is final. However,
for some reason, on this return trip to Bergen, the random business
travel flight booking system has elected to book me into business class
on both legs.</p>

<p>In fact, on the outward journey from Gatwick, this was a little
embarrassing. I was the only passenger on a half-empty plane so I was
privileged enough to have the sole, exclusive, undivided attention of
one, pretty air hostess all to myself.</p>

<p>Every 30 seconds, she would appear with a beaming smile: &#8216;Champagne, Sir
?, &#8216;Hot towel, Sir ?&#8217;, &#8216;Another drink, Sir ?&#8217;, &#8216;Pretzels, Sir ?&#8217;, &#8216;Hot
meal, Sir ?&#8217;, &#8216;Newspaper, Sir ?, &#8216;Could I offer you a beer perhaps, Sir
?&#8217; God, it was never ending. It was eerily reminiscent of the &#8216;Not The
Nine O&#8217;Clock News&#8217; <a href="http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=ZF-U9nL9Ios">sketch</a>
where Pamela Stephenson invites an American Express customer &#8216;Would you
like to put your head between them and go &#8216;Bubble, bubble bubble ?&#8217;.
Almost but not quite.</p>

<p>I finally enter the plane and look at seat 2C which, oddly enough is on
the first row. However, this means there is no hook on which to hang my
coat and there is some metal fixture preventing me placing my laptop
under my seat. I start to panic and look towards the overhead lockers.
Inevitably, as this flight is completely full, so are the overhead
lockers.</p>

<p>There is a hanging cupboard to my right where coats and overflow luggage
has been stowed with some spare capacity so I quickly remove my coat. In
my rush, I forget that I am wired into my iTouch and the my earphones
are pulled out of my ears leaving wires dangling everywhere. A helpful
Dutch Gentleman interjects:</p>

<p>&#8216;Excuse me - but your ears are on the floor.&#8217;</p>

<p>Quick as a flash, I reply: &#8216;Hey come on, My ears are pretty big but they
don&#8217;t reach down that far.&#8217; He laughs. Nervously. The air stewardess is
now desperately trying to close the flight and do the very important
passenger count (2-4-8-11-15-17, doh, 2-4-8). She looks my way and
enquires: &#8216;Excuse me, Sir but is that your laptop ?&#8217;. As I am still
embroiled in the continuing, unarmed struggle to disentangle my ears
from the iTouch and my coat, I look over and nod.</p>

<p>&#8216;Well I am sorry, Sir, but you have placed your laptop on top of the the
defibrillator so I will just have to find another place for it.&#8217; Her
tone implied I had committed a capital offence and I honestly feared she
was going to place my Lenovo T61 on the left wing of the aircraft.</p>

<p>Finally, we sit down to be told in two languages (but not Chinese) that
the rush to board was all for nothing as now there is a small problem
with the navigation system which the engineer is coming fix and then &#8216;we
will be on our way, flying to London&#8217;.</p>

<p>Time passes - we listen to music, we read papers, we look out of the
window looking for a laptop bag. An engineer in blue overalls arrives
and leaves, laughing and joking. I think I heard him say to the first
officer: &#8216;Yes - if it happens again during the flight just reboot it.&#8217;</p>

<p>The smooth talking pilot announces: &#8216;Ladies and gentlemen, the
navigation system is now fully operational so we will just have a 10
minute taxi to the runway and we will on on our way.&#8217;</p>

<p>I must have dozed off, tired after 4 days of intense work and a night in
a Bergen sports bar, drinking expensive Norwegian lager, watching United
somehow contrive to lose to a Championship side.</p>

<p>When I awoke, I stretched out, looked at my watch and glanced out of the
window to find we have arrived in London. I must have slept so soundly I
had even missed the descent and more importantly, my complimentary bread
roll, metal cutlery and glass of wine.</p>

<p>I unbuckled my seat belt when my well spoken neighbour informed me: &#8216;We
are still at Schipol. We haven&#8217;t taken off yet. There is a problem
de-icing the plane.&#8217;</p>

<p>I buckled up again, grunted my appreciation and put wires into my
oversized ears. Eventually, another engineer popped down to the aircraft
equivalent of Halfords, a fresh aerosol can of de-icer arrived and we
taxied to join the rear of a lengthy queue of large aircraft waiting to
depart to various destinations.</p>

<p>Finally, we took off and I was able to enjoy my bread roll and glass of
wine. I arrived in London just an hour late. So did my bag and I got
home at 10:30pm - a full seven and a half hours after I had left Bergen.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Amazon (UK) recently
<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/MP3-Music-Download/b/ref=amb_link_82789473_4?ie=UTF8&amp;node=77197031&amp;pf_rd_m=A3P5ROKL5A1OLE&amp;pf_rd_s=center-0&amp;pf_rd_r=0QH4MW4VEHZ0GDK985R8&amp;pf_rd_t=101&amp;pf_rd_p=464904573&amp;pf_rd_i=468294">announced</a>
an online music store and a &pound;3 discount on all music downloads on
Christmas Day and Boxing Day.</p>

<p>To download an album, you need the Amazon Download utility and the music
is MP3 format encoded at 256kbps. Best of all, the music is DRM free so
you can transfer, copy and play on any device. Normally, I like to buy
an actual CD so I can rip into whatever format I need and also as a
backup so &#8216;The Seldom Seen Kid&#8217; by &#8216;Elbow&#8217; was my first ever purchase of
online music</p>

<p>Downloaded music is automatically added to iTunes or Media Player and
the only glitch was that the Downloader didn&#8217;t appear to work under
Google Chrome.</p>

<p>As this album (and quite a few others) only costs &pound;3, this album was
free. As in beer.</p>
