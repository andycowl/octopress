  <div class="entry-content"><p>Apologies for the delayed transmission but the events of last Saturday
left me traumatised and deeply shocked.</p>

<p>You might find it hard to believe that a once great club has been
relegated to Division 2.</p>

<p>You might even shed a tear for the diminutive, chirpy, cheeky Cockney
who manages this football club.</p>

<p>You might hope and pray that this sleeping giant makes a rapid return to
the heady heights of, err, the Championship.</p>

<p>You might remember the halcyon days of the 70&#8217;s when they were
undoubtedly the top club in the country.</p>

<p>You might feel sorry for the Chairman (aka Grandad Smurf) who ploughed
thousands of pounds out of his own money into the club in a futile
attempt to stem the tide.</p>

<p>You might empathise with their massive, dedicated, loyal, law abiding,
long suffering &#8216;supporters&#8217; and think &#8216;Oh dear what a shame&#8217;.</p>

<p>You might remember the heady days just six years ago when they &#8216;lived
the dream&#8217; and actually reached a European Cup Semi Final.</p>

<p>You might wonder how this has happened just 12 months after the club
were 90 minutes away from a return to the Premiership but narrowly lost
out to the mighty, err, Watford.</p>

<p>You might but I don&#8217;t. Good riddance to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leeds_United_A.F.C._History">Leeds</a>
United.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Dust off that blogroll. Highlight your best technical posts. Update that
photo in the &#8216;About&#8217; tab. Polish the colours on your theme. Prime the
hit counter and prepare for an invasion from the Web 2.0 &#8216;A&#8217; listers.</p>

<p>Justin <a href="http://blogs.oracle.com/otn/">Kestelyn</a> (Oracle Technical
Network) sparked some an interesting and though provoking
<a href="http://blogs.oracle.com/otn/2007/04/26#a439">discussion</a> when he
puzzled over the relatively low profile of Oracle Corporation in the Web
2.0 community.</p>

<p>Robert Scoble picked up the
<a href="http://scobleizer.com/2007/04/26/oracle-cant-get-blogging-respect/">thread</a>
(<a href="http://scobleizer.com/2007/04/27/note-to-oracle-not-me/">twice</a>) and
there are some interesting comments. Certainly, I&#8217;d love to see a Scoble
podcast from Oracle Corporation.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know enough about what Oracle&#8217;s rivals (IBM, Sun, HP, SAP,
<del>Siebel</del>) are doing out there in the blogging community or how these
companies are perceived by the Web 2.0 community to know whether Oracle
is hard done by.</p>

<p>That said, a couple of points on Justin&#8217;s original post</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;Oracle&#8217;s aggressive support of blogging&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>As an Oracle employee, while Oracle encourages and supports the blogging
efforts of both employees and non-employees I think &#8216;aggressive&#8217; is
probably overstating the case. For example, Oracle don&#8217;t offer a hosted
blogging platform for aspiring authors merely a listing in a (albeit
high profile) directory.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8217; rather large blogging community&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>For a company of 70,000 employees worldwide, does a blogroll containing
61 employee blogs, 10 executive blogs and 100 blogs from technical users
truly constitute a &#8216;large blogging community&#8217; ?
It would be interesting to know how the number (in percentage terms) of
Microsoft and Google employees actively blogging compares with Oracle.</p>

<p>I am an Oracle employee and I have a neglected (internal eyes only)
corporate blog only and this blog for my own personal outpourings. I
have also occasionally toyed with the idea of applying for a corporate
blog. However, to date, I have always resisted this temptation because
although I am positive that a listing on
<a href="http://blogs.oracle.com/">blogs.oracle.com</a> would drive a lot of
traffic and boost my ego, maintaining a corporate blog carries a great
deal of responsibility.</p>

<p>I am not referring to the Oracle guidelines governing content on a
corporate sanctioned blog as these are common sense and perfectly
reasonable. In fact, I am already obliged to abide by those guidelines
here on this personal blog.</p>

<p>Authoring an &#8216;official&#8217; Oracle blog would immediately create a wealth of
(self-imposed) pressure on me to maintain that blog and keep adding
technical, well researched, accurate, interesting and valuable content.</p>

<p>In my current role, I spend most of my working time working for
customers. I simply do not have the spare time to spend maintaining a
corporate blog.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;Or maybe I shouldn&#8217;t even care !&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>Justin&#8217;s closing paragraph is interesting. I am an Oracle employee and I
also hold Oracle stock. Consequently, I am more concerned with Oracle
product development and the stock price than how many engineers are
blogging this week and whether Oracle have been invited to participate
or host the latest &#8217;<a href="http://www.web-strategist.com/blog/2007/04/27/dear-oracle-bloggers-host-a-lunch-20/">Lunch

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The climax of the football season is currently dominating my life
somewhat. However, I feel obliged to inform the world of my exciting
plans for the next fortnight.</p>

<p>Following next week&#8217;s UK Bank Holiday, the scheduling goddess informs me
me that I will be doing a &#8216;brown bag&#8217;. This means that next Tuesday will
see me wandering aimlessly around the shopping precinct in Reading,
spontaneously shouting at shoppers while clutching four cans of Special
Brew in a brown bag.</p>

<p>For the remainder of the week, I will be returning to the scene of last
years summer holiday - Norway. Again, the work calendar informs me I
will be spending 8 days embroiled in what is tersely described as a
&#8216;deep dive&#8217;.</p>

<p>While I appreciate the break from work and the respite from staring
blankly at a computer screen, I do have some reservations about this
&#8216;deep dive&#8217; activity. Bear in mind that I very nearly
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/08/22/holiday-highlights/">drowned</a>
whilst hiring a motor boat on the Norwegian fjords last year.</p>

<p>Still, it will be a fantastic opportunity to learn all about the
fascinating world of scuba diving and hopefully realise a lifelong
ambition and gain my Padi Open Water qualification. This means I will be
able to stop boring people with my detailed analysis of the football
season and my offspring&#8217;s sporting prowess and academic abilities.</p>

<p>Now, armed and dangerous with a Padi, I will fully empowered to
participate in prolonged and tedious dinner party conversations about
the joys of scuba diving and the pros and cons of the crystal clear,
warm water in Egypt versus a purpose-built, 20 metre, freezing swimming
pool in Plymouth naval base.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I received a summons yesterday for non-payment of council tax. Ah well.
It was good while it lasted. I reckon at &pound;1,000 each year for 10 years
residence at this address, I probably saved in excess of &pound;10,000.</p>

<p>Still, all good things must come to an end. What a pity those rotters at
the council caught up with me.</p>

<p>Then I realised - I already pay my council tax automatically by direct
debit to fund the firemen, refuse collectors, recycling collections, the
lengthy queues at the tip on a Sunday morning, the multitude of speed
bumps and liquid lunches for the fine councillors of this parish.</p>

<p>I read the letter more carefully and then I remembered. This demand for
council tax was for a property in Dover. I do not own a property in
Dover. I do not want to own a property in Dover. In addition, the named
person on the summons was not actually me.</p>

<p>Then I remembered. I had already received an initial bill from Dover
City Council which I ignored followed by a red letter which I
&#8216;annotated&#8217; and returned to sender. Finally, I received a final demand
from Dover City Council so I had to write yet another letter explaining
the situation.</p>

<p>At this point, Norma started to worry that I might be sent to prison
(and be molested in the showers by hard-core criminals) so now I was
forced to call Dover City Council on the telephone to explain the
situation to a human being.</p>

<p>I was assured by a helpful lady with a funny accent that they would
update their records accordingly and she even apologised for the
inconvenience and upset caused. Then she passed me onto &#8216;Debt Recovery&#8217;
where a menacing, softly spoken gentleman demanded to know if I knew
where &#8216;Andrew Henderson&#8217; actually lived.</p>

<p>This communication ended the whole administrative nightmare and I forgot
about it until the summons arrived yesterday.</p>

<p>Now Norma is locked in the house armed with a shotgun, living in fear of
the baliffs arriving to seize goods to the values of &pound;548.21. I told her
my United programs were absolutely sacrosanct and maybe consider wearing
a short skirt, a wide smile and negotiate &#8216;payment in kind&#8217;. This
strategy worked very well with the driving examiner.</p>

<p>However, I suspect when I return home, I will discover that she will
have buried all our valuables (both of them) in the garden and deposited
all our money (&pound;17.89 and some dollars) in the loft.</p>

<p>I only hope she doesn&#8217;t shoot the window cleaner who calls every other
Thursday.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am very lazy. It takes a gargantuan effort for me to maintain
motivation and continue making material up for this blog.</p>

<p>Therefore, actually sitting down, in my own time, to compose a letter
to appeal against a &pound;20 fine imposed by Transport For London on
my 14 year old daughter, Norma Jean, was not a task I undertook
lightly.</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t appeal because I can&#8217;t afford the &pound;20.</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t appeal because I think my daughter is above the law.</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t appeal because I disputed a similar case five years ago when
I was caught on a train without my monthly travel card and
successfully got the fine waived &#8216;without prejudice&#8217;.</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t appeal because I think I will be successful.</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t appeal because I want my daughter to conduct her own defence in
a court of law.</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t appeal because I want to get in the local paper.</p>

<p>I appealed because my daughter is entitled to free bus travel and
applied for an OysterCard to prove it.</p>

<p>I appealed because a &pound;20 penalty fine for the heinous crime of
dodging a bus fare of, err, zero pounds and zero pence is completely
disproportionate and utterly ridiculous.</p>

<p>So, when my daughter hangs herself from a light fitting using a pair of
tights in Feltham Young Offenders Institute, don&#8217;t blame me, blame the
Nazi Bus Inspector who asked her</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;Do you have an OysterCard ?&#8217;
&#8216;Yes.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Do you have your OysterCard on you ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yea - oh no - err, wait a minute, hang on, no, sorry. I left it at
home.&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>to which he replied</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;Excellent&#8217;.</p></blockquote>
