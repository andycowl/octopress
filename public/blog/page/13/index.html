  <div class="entry-content"><p>Friday</p>

<p>&#8216;Can I touch them ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No. Not yet.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Look - it&#8217;s been four months now. When can I touch them ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Not yet. I&#8217;ve already told you, I&#8217;m not ready&#8217;.</p>

<p>Sunday</p>

<p>&#8216;Please can I touch them ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No - not yet. Just a couple more days. But you can help me, if you
like.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh what is it now ? The footy&#8217;s on in a minute.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Listen. Forget about the god-damned football for just one minute. Put
your pole in here now because I want to drape them all around your
pole.&#8217;</p>

<p>Crikey - this was like birthday, significant anniversary, Christmas and
the last 5 minutes of the 1999 European Cup Final rolled into one. What
a superb, generous, unsolicited and unexpected offer !</p>

<p>&#8216;Norma-Jeane, Norma-Jeane - set the V+ to record the footy - channel
511, will you ?&#8217;</p>

<p>I rammed my pole home hard and wiggled it about a little to ensure is
was erect and vertical.</p>

<p>&#8216;Is that it ? Now what ?</p>

<p>&#8216;I am going to tie three knots at the base, in the middle and on the top
of your pole. Pass me that green twine.&#8217;</p>

<p>Now I&#8217;m open minded and all for experimentation. Just as long as it
doesn&#8217;t end in autoerotic asphyxiation. Especially with my asthma.</p>

<p>&#8216;OK - that&#8217;s not too bad. Now what ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;We wait for a couple of days.&#8217;</p>

<p>Wednesday</p>

<p>&#8216;Maybe I could just hold one - just for a second ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No. Just a couple more days. It&#8217;ll be worth the wait, I promise.&#8217;</p>

<p>Saturday</p>

<p>&#8216;OK - I&#8217;m ready. Shall we take one each ?&#8217;</p>

<p>Finally, the moment has arrived and the waiting is over. I breathed
deeply, leant forward and took the forbidden fruit (the left one) in my
hand.</p>

<p>&#8216;What do you think ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;It is just beautiful; firm, pert, round, perfect shape and just the
right size.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Do you want to bite it - but just gently ?&#8217;</p>

<p>I certainly didn&#8217;t need a second invitation and slowly brought it up to
my mouth. I paused to savour the smell and marvelled as I stroked the
smooth skin, devoid of any blemishes.</p>

<p>I bit - a little too hard. I heard a gasp and a soft moan.</p>

<p>I felt an explosion of liquid in my mouth. I was taken to another place.
I closed my eyes. I was in heaven.</p>

<p>Then, I suddenly realised I had seed dripping down my chin.</p>

<p>&#8216;What are you pulling that stupid face for ? Go and pick six more ripe
ones for tea. Oh - and you&#8217;ve got tomato juice all down your work
shirt.&#8217;</p>

<p>So, if you want to save money in these tense, difficult economic times
and rejuvenate your sex life, grow your own tomatoes.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I like most sports but I hate rugby union with a passion for the
following reasons:</p>

<p>At (Grammar) school, I was forced to play rugby because it was somehow
viewed as &#8216;character building&#8217;. On a cold, wet autumn day, a sports
master took one look at me and grunted &#8216;You. Second row&#8217;. I then
proceeded to grab the crotch of the boy in front of me while a boy
behind me grabbed my crotch. I then had to insert my head between the
thighs of two boys in front of me.</p>

<p>If the scrum didn&#8217;t collapse, which meant we had to start the prolonged
mating ritual all over again, eight lads would eventually extract our
body parts and look across the wet, muddy field in the hope that someone
was running somewhere with the ball. Of course, this never happened and
the sports master would be screaming &#8216;Scrum it down, &#8216;ere&#8217; so we would
have to run to the prescribed point (the only exercise we got all
afternoon) and start all over again. Brilliant, &#8216;character building&#8217;
stuff.</p>

<p>At University, the Union Sports bar was notable for one thing only. It
was only hostelry out of the 27 available that was open during the early
afternoon hiatus between 2pm and 4pm. Consequently, we spent a lot of
time there - not because we played any competitive sport representing
the University but because we liked to drink all day long, if at all
possible.</p>

<p>Our long, wide ranging philosophical discussions were often interrupted
(particularly on a Wednesday) by people standing on the tables, singing
bawdy songs, loud and out of tune. As the afternoon proceeded, various
items of clothing would be discarded until they were fully naked,
singing their stupid, crude rugger bugger songs while we discussed
urgent, pressing, important matters of global interest (which bar should
we adjourn to next). That was just the women&#8217;s first XV - things only
got worse when the blokes arrived fresh out of the showers,</p>

<p>And the final reason that rugby union is a complete joke - the
disciplinary code</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/international/4376306.stm">Spear
tackle</a>
(holding someone upside down and smashing their head into the ground
which could potentially kill them) - no action.</li>
<li><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/8122711.stm">Eye
gouging</a>
(twisting your fingers hard into someone&#8217;s eye socket which could
result in the loss of an eye surprisingly enough) - 8 week ban.</li>
<li><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/my_club/harlequins/8191371.stm">Feigning
injury</a>
to seek a tactical advantage - 4 month ban for player (reduced from
12 months after digging the dirt), 3 year ban for coach, 2 year ban
for physio, &pound;260,000 fine for club.</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This humble blog is four years
<a href="http://nbrightside.com/blog/2005/08/17/dot-bombs">old</a> today so tonight
I will be taking &#8216;Blog in isolation&#8217; and some of its closest friends to
LazerQuest (Mega Death Match Party Edition with Pizza and gallons of
Coca Cola to ensure the kids are well and truly revved up).</p>

<p>Everyone loves meaningful statistics so here is a pretty chart of posts
by month (for all you management types):</p>

Curiously, since I returned from my holiday, I seem to have rediscovered
a little of my zest for blogging. Also, I have a feeling that things are
gradually turning full circle. My initial decision to dip my toe in the
water was prompted by reading and enjoying the writing of other people
and I sense that element is slowly returning. More recently, reading
blogs had turned into mindlessly hitting &#8216;J&#8217; in Google Reader as fast as
humanly possible simply in order to say &#8216;Done&#8217;.</p>

<p>Over the weekend, I spent time enjoying some
<a href="http://diamondgeezer.blogspot.com/2005_07_01_archive.html#112192551110319719">brilliant</a>
<a href="http://diamondgeezer.blogspot.com/2005_09_01_diamondgeezer_archive.html#112615864053932787">posts</a>
from the dusty archives of one of my favourite UK bloggers - <a href="http://diamondgeezer.blogspot.com">Diamond
Geezer</a> (pseudonym alert). This, in
turn, (via his blogroll) led to the discovery of a handful of other
<a href="http://www.dummies-for-destruction.co.uk/random/">interesting</a> and
downright
<a href="http://scaryduck.blogspot.com/2009/08/neither-mirth-nor-woe-sucker.html">funny</a>
UK blogs. I have
<a href="http://nbrightside.com/blog/2006/08/09/the-state-of-the-uk-blogosphere">bemoaned</a>
my <a href="http://nbrightside.com/blog/2007/11/14/top-10-uk-blogs">failure</a> to
find decent UK blogs more than once - maybe I just didn&#8217;t look hard
enough or in the right places.</p>

<p>Before my holiday, I was experimenting once again with
<a href="http://andyc.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a> and
<a href="http://andyc.posterous.com/">Posterous</a> and while these services may
have a place for a rapid fire linkblogs, scrapbooks and ready made, easy
blogs (for people who don&#8217;t know or care what a blog is), I suspect that
posts I made there were simply posts I could have equally made over
here. But I was too
<a href="http://nbrightside.com/blog/2007/02/08/the-art-of-lazy-consultancy">lazy</a>.</p>

<p>Blogging takes time. Blogging is difficult. Blogging is time-consuming.</p>

<p>Firstly, you have to think of a subject. Then you have to waste time
thinking up all the words. Then you have to login. to your blog Then you
have to actually type all the words in. Then you have to endlessly
preview and endeavour to fix all your typos and grammar. Then you have
to add an image to spice things up and break the article into logical
sections for your reader (just like the &#8216;Blogging 101 Guide&#8217; says). Then
you have to add tags. Then you have to monitor and reply to all
comments. Then you have to publicise it.</p>

<p>Yes - blogging is hard. So much easier and a lot quicker to hit &#8216;Like&#8217;
what someone else has produced.</p>

<p>Ironically, the well publicised
<a href="http://blog.friendfeed.com/2009/08/friendfeed-accepts-facebook-friend.html">death</a>
of <a href="http://friendfeed.com/">FriendFeed</a> sparked my interest and I was
briefly active again over there, providing counselling services to the
bereaved.</p>

<p>So, what does all of this mean for the next four years of this blog ?
God knows.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Memories of the annual summer vacation are now fading, the <a href="http://nbrightside.com/blog/2006/09/03/a-short-history-of-digital-photography">digital
photos</a>
have been rationalised and printed, the video footage remains on the

(thankfully) and the entries for &#8217;<a href="http://nbrightside.com/blog/2006/08/22/holiday-highlights">Holiday
Highlights</a>&#8217;
have now been received and short-listed.</p>

<p>Norma - &#8216;So many memories. Catching up with friends and family, the
climate, the lifestyle, The awesome scenery of the Bungle Bungles, the
idyll that is Hamilton Island, sailing to Freemantle, cuddling a Koala,
the endless miles of white sand and blue sky at Cable Beach.&#8217;</p>

<p>Norman - &#8216;When Norma spotted the first kangeroo in the wild but couldn&#8217;t
tell anyone because she was squatting down in the bush, having a pee.&#8217;</p>

<p>Norman Junior III - &#8216;When we were having that lovely Aussie sing-song on
the 4x4 truck, we ran out of songs and there was a brief silence until
Dad piped up with &#8216;Maybe it&#8217;s because I&#8217;m a Londoner.&#8217;</p>

<p>Norma Jeane - &#8216;Free Internet access and those little drawers where you
can charge cameras, phones and iPods at Singapore airport.&#8217;</p>

<p>Auntie Vera - &#8216;When Norma mounted the kerb while driving the beach buggy
on Hamilton Island. And nearly ran that lady over.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s been a lot of chatter recently about Feedburner&#8217;s support for
the
<a href="http://adsenseforfeeds.blogspot.com/2009/07/whats-all-hubbub-about-pubsubhubbub.html">PubSubHubbub</a>
protocol.</p>

<p>Apparently, it means that blog posts show up much quicker in FriendFeed,
Google Reader and other services. I must admit I was fairly sceptical as
my posts still take a couple of hours to appear.</p>

<p>However, I was wrong (again). Look at this recent example. The post
showed up a full three and a half hours on Google Reader before I
published it.</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/4YsjJALcR1Cq7Dq-YSu_mQ?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_l2uGy1RGCiE/SoK2a8H281I/AAAAAAAABY0/b2PMUBmXcGc/s800/gReader.PNG" alt="image" /></a>
Apparently, the next release will read your mind, type the words in,
link to relevant pictures and publish your blog entries automatically.
It&#8217;s called the &#8216;real-time Web&#8217;.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently noticed a couple of additional HD channels now available on
Virgin Media.</p>

<ul>
<li>C4 - not that much of a bonus.</li>
<li>ESPN - will broadcast all the football matches previously screened
by Setanta - in High Defintion - at no extra cost. Superb.</li>

<p>Slightly irritating that Virgin Media can send me a fun packed
newsletter (via email) but don&#8217;t have a blog or sensible way of
communicating this useful information to me.</p>

<p>Sun = wicked. Sea = wicked. Sex = wicked (geddit ?). Loadsa Brits out
here. Able to get The Sun delivered. Happy hour - all day long (nudge,
nudge).</p>

<p>Last night, I asked a bird if she fancied a ride on my very own &#8216;banana
boat&#8217;.</p>

<p>She slapped me (just like being back at home :-) then she poured sambuca
all over me balls.</p>

<p>I went: &#8216;Hey - hang on love, let&#8217;s get back to me hotel room. There&#8217;s
people watching here, innit ?&#8217;</p>

<p>Then she got a lighter and set
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/8189296.stm">fire</a> to me balls.
Ouch.</p>

<p>Bazzer said I should have said &#8216;OK - I suppose a shag&#8217;s out of the
question then ?&#8217; but I was diving into the swimming pool.</p>

<p>Will be laid up in hospital for a bit (but I won&#8217;t be getting &#8216;a bit&#8217;
for a while - geddit ?).</p>

<p>Hope to be out by Thursday as Julian&#8217;s taking us all to Knossos for the
day.</p>

<p>Luv ya - Stuart.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is a quick test to check that Habari is no longer adding additional
paragragh tags and random line breaks for people consuming this blog in
a feed reader.</p>

<p>Both of you.</p>

<p>Many thanks to arthus (possible pseudonym alert) aka <a href="http://newlyancient.com/about">Morgante
Pell</a> (additional pseudonym alert) for
creating the
<a href="http://trac.habariproject.org/habari-extras/changeset/2193">plugin</a>
that made this possible and the death of autop().</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Garry Tan, a developer for <a href="http://posterous.com/">Posterous</a> (a simple
but powerful blog platform), wrote a brilliant
<a href="http://garry.posterous.com/practicing-product-minimalism">post</a> about
product design.</p>

<blockquote><p>Are there any questions? I said yes &#8211; one last one: &#8220;When do we
decide to remove features?&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>In a similar vein, Amit Agarwal asks &#8216;What&#8217;s Common Between an iPod and
Google ?&#8217; Answer:
<a href="http://www.labnol.org/internet/marvel-of-simplicity/9357/">Simplicity</a>.</p>

<p>If I had a cube, I would print both articles out and pin them up.</p>
