  <div class="entry-content"><p>London, near England - 23 April 2008. For immediate release.</p>

<p>Brightside Software Enterprises are pleased to announce the immediate
availability of &#8216;FriendOrFoe&#8217;.</p>

<p>Tired of being followed by those mindless idiots on Twitter, not to
mention those horrid spammers ?</p>

<p>Tired of having to search out new friends with similar interests, sense
of humour and outlook ?</p>

<p>Tired of being a &#8216;soul in isolation&#8217; with 0 (zero) friends in the whole
wide world ?</p>

<p>&#8216;FriendOrFoe&#8217; is a simple Twitter utility that will subject all Twitter
&#8216;Follow&#8217; requests to lengthy and vigorous inspection using sophisticated
algorithms, advanced AI techniques together with analysis of &#8216;social
graphs&#8217; to categorise the prospective follower as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Spammer (Citeh or Liverpool fan filters available soon) - user will
be automatically blocked and receive a DM stating &#8216;Don&#8217;t follow me,
follow Jesus&#8217;.</li>
<li>Friend - automatically follow back, sending a DM to the recipient&#8217;s
mobile, changing the ring-tone to U2&#8217;s &#8216;I will follow&#8217;.</li>
<li>Stalker - automatically followed on Twitter, FriendFeed, Ponce,
Jaiku, NetVibes and footage of user streamed on live Webcam, right
into your bedsit.</li>
<li>Anyone, anytime, anywhere (aka &#8216;Promiscuous mode&#8217;) - all Follow
requests are blindly followed with a DM of &#8216;Hey I&#8217;m pretty
desperate. Fancy a drink ?&#8217;</li>
</ul>


<p>&#8216;FriendOrFoe&#8217; is freely available now as a set of Greasy scripts written
by 1,000 monkeys, bashing away continuously for 8 days, on a Dvorak
keyboard.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Many disgruntled readers have contacted me via email, IM, facsimilie,
phone and anonymous posion pen letters to ask &#8216;Hey Norman - whatever
happened to the unified blogging day scheduled for Friday 18 April ?&#8217;</p>

<p>Apologies for the delay but before we get started, some random,
meaningless statistics:</p>

<ul>
<li>Feedburner: 66 subscribers.</li>
<li>Google Reader : &#8216;From your 189 subscriptions, over the last 30 days
you read 6,807 items, starred 1 items,
<a href="https://www.google.com/reader/shared/08375973873450584543">shared</a>
325 items&#8217;.</li>
<li>Twitter: Following 19. Followers 55. Updates 1,292 in 87 days.</li>
<li>FriendFeed: Subscribed to 35. Subscribed to me: 30.
<a href="http://friendfeed.com/andyc/comments">Comments</a>: 180 this week, 504
all time. <a href="http://friendfeed.com/andyc/likes">Likes</a>: 77 this week,
188 all time.</li>
<li>Disqus: Comments left: 59 in 21 days. Comments on my blog: 31 in 14
days. Precious clout points - 12.</li>
</ul>


<p>Originally, on Unified Blogging Day, I was going to religiously
transcribe every single &#8216;output&#8217; over a 24 hour period into a separate
blog entry (annotated with timestamp and channel).</p>

<p>This was primarily a final effort to alienate loyal (but shell-shocked)
readers who had survived the WordPress to Habari migration.</p>

<p>However, thankfully, <a href="http://friendfeed.com/">FriendFeed</a> already
aggregates that inane stream of consciousness beautifully formatted
<a href="http://friendfeed.com/andyc">here</a>.</p>

<p>A secondary aim of Unified Blogging Day was to conduct a detailed poll
to see how people subscribe to each &#8216;output&#8217; but Habari doesn&#8217;t have a
&#8216;Poll&#8217; plugin so just leave a comment below indicating which channel(s)
you are a) aware of, b) subscribe to c) devour feverishly and d)
blissfully unaware of.
-   <a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/">Blog</a> - a man barely alive but we</p>

<pre><code>have the technology to rebuild him.
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://andyc.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a> - stuff I&#8217;m too embarassed to put
on the blog.</li>
<li>Technical <a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/drupal/">blog</a> - low traffic.</li>
<li><a href="http://twitter.com/andycowl">Twitter</a> - endless stream of drivel
(soon to be upgraded to include &#8216;Hello&#8217;, Goodnight&#8217; and the state of
my runny nose).</li>
<li><a href="http://disqus.com/people/andycowl/">Disqus</a> - every single comment
I have left on the blogoshpere (on Disqus enabled blogs).</li>
<li><a href="http://friendfeed.com/andyc">FriendFeed</a> - unified feed of all of
the above. Filters available to reduce the signal/noise ratio.</li>
</ul>


<p>Anyone owning up to subscribing to duplicate channels will have stay
behind after school for 1 hours detention (unless they have a note from
Mummy).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Thoroughly enjoyed 2 hours of &#8216;The Story of The Who&#8217; last night on
<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/listings/programme.shtml?day=yesterday&amp;filename=20080418/20080418_2130_4544_15851_120&amp;service_id=4544">BBC4</a>.
What a story it was.</p>

<p>The ultimate rock&#8217;n&#8217;roll band. A Rolls Royce driven into a swimming
pool, copious amounts of drugs, lots of girls and the premature death of
two band members. During one gig, Moon was carried off stage -
completely comatose.</p>

<p>30 years on, Pete Townshend looked visibly choked when talking about the
(not wholly unexpected) death of Keith Moon and Roger Daltrey remarked
&#8216;Keith seemed to think he was invincible. He thought I am &#8220;Keith Moon of
The Who&#8221;.&#8217;</p>

<p>Townshend&#8217;s and Daltrey&#8217;s immediate reaction to Moon&#8217;s death was ironic;
they tried to assuage feelings of guilt by going out, doing &#8216;crazy
things&#8217; and experimented with &#8216;even more substances&#8217;.</p>

<p>I never appreciated what a great bass player John Entwhistle was and he
seemed the quiet, sensible one although he later died on tour in Las
Vegas, in bed with a woman, after snorting cocaine (from a heart
attack). Well it sure beats dying in your sleep.</p>

<p>There was some great footage and interviews but this clip epitomised The
Who at their supreme best.</p>

<p>The American host has a chat with the band and introduces &#8216;My
Generation&#8217; with the immortal words: &#8216;You&#8217;re going to be surprised at
what happens. This is excitement.&#8217;</p>

<p>The band ended a brilliant performance by trashing their instruments
with the normal dry ice and smoke bombs.</p>

<p>However, no-one (not even the other band members) knew that Moon had
bribed a stage-hand to pack his drum kit with explosives. The effect
reminds me of the line from the classic film &#8216;Butch Cassidy and the
Sundance Kid&#8217; - &#8216;Do you think we used enough dynamite there, Butch ?&#8217;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A couple of Oracle bloggers
(<a href="http://laurentschneider.com/wordpress/2008/04/disqus-comments.html">Laurent</a>
and <a href="http://oracletoday.blogspot.com">Yas</a>) are experimenting with
Disqus on their blogs but Tim Hall has expressed some
<a href="http://twitter.com/oraclebase/statuses/787098263">reservations</a> about
committing his blog comments to a hosted service outside of his control.</p>

<p>Jake Mckee is also taken by Disqus but eloquently expresses similar
<a href="http://disqus.disqus.com/major_concerns_with_data_ownership_presentation/">concerns</a>
about &#8216;data ownership and presentation&#8217;.</p>

<p>I understand (and used to vehemently share) both Tim and Jake&#8217;s
reservations. It does seem perfectly natural to want all your blog
content stored in your MySql database on your server. What if Disqus
servers are slow and unresponsive or worse, even down ? Your blog would
be accessible but your comments wouldn&#8217;t. What is Disqus isn&#8217;t around
next year ?</p>

<p>How do you unlock your comments from the Disqus repository and migrate
them back into your blog ? How do you backup your comments ? There is an
export utility but, as Jake points out, currently no easy way to import
the data back into the blog.</p>

<p>Having comments hosted on your own blog is entirely logical. Obviously,
blog comments belong with the blog content. Without the associated
comments, the blog is like a half-written book.</p>

<p>You manage the blog comments. You back them up. You moderate them. The
blog comments obviously belong to you. All of them. Yes - even those
1,729 spam comments, you have to scan for the odd &#8216;false positive&#8217;.</p>

<p>However, if I leave a comment on a Harry&#8217;s disqus enabled blog, my
comment is displayed on the original blog. The comment text that I typed
in is no longer stored in Harry&#8217;s database table for &#8216;comments&#8217;. Worse,
my comment is now simultaneously displayed on a Disqus community forum
without my prior knowledge or approval.</p>

<p>But who actually owns that comment on Harry&#8217;s blog. I thought of the
words and typed them into the comment box. Do I own the comment ? Or
does Harry ? Does it even matter ?</p>

<p>As an aside, having used the service for a week, I no longer view Disqus
purely as a comment tracking service. I view Disqus as a &#8216;content
output&#8217; tracking service.</p>

<p>For example, I am now starting to ask idiotic questions and log issues
on the Disqus forums. These posts are not clearly not comments (but
original content) but I still want to track them (and, more importantly,
responses to them) in my Disqus dashboard alongside my blog comments.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This blog used to run on <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> but now runs
on <a href="http://www.habariproject.org/en/">Habari</a> which is a blogging
platform currently being developed by a set of very talented people.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly, the number of developers and users running Habari is far
fewer than the massive community using WordPress. Similarly, the number
of available <a href="http://wiki.habariproject.org/en/Themes">themes</a> and
<a href="http://wiki.habariproject.org/en/Available_Plugins">plugins</a> available
for Habari is relatively small (albeit growing daily) and dwarfed by the
vast, almost bewildering wealth of add-ons and the extensive range of
themes available for Wordpress.</p>

<p>However, this isn&#8217;t a bad thing because it forces anyone contemplating a
migration to Habari to think carefully about the core plugins that are
truly essential to adminster your blog and valuable for your readers.</p>

<p>One such plugin (for me) was an equivalent of the Wordpress sitemaps
<a href="http://www.arnebrachhold.de/projects/wordpress-plugins/google-xml-sitemaps-generator/">plugin</a>.
Rick Cockrum published a excellent
<a href="http://sagrising.cockrumpublishing.com/sitemaps-for-google">summary</a> of
why an automatically generated sitemap is useful.</p>

<p>When I first configured and activated the sitemap plugin for Habari,
nothing happened. No sitemap file was generated. Initially, I thought
that maybe the sitemap was only generated after a post was published. So
I published a new post. Still nothing happened..</p>

<p>I posted a enquiry on the Habari users mailing
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/habari-users/browse_thread/thread/863f82a5f4945ddd/99b4e76e3edd4d05?lnk=gst&amp;q=sitemap#99b4e76e3edd4d05">list</a>.
In an effort to &#8216;help&#8217; the Habari community, I even opened a
<a href="http://trac.habariproject.org/habari-extras/ticket/2">ticket</a> (bug
request).</p>

<p>Then, I made an amazing discovery when an anonymous author was forced to
waste some of his valuable time to close my &#8216;bug report&#8217;:</p>

<blockquote><p>The plugin is not intended to generate a file, rather to serve the
sitemap xml document when requested.</p></blockquote>

<p>So, it transpires that the Habari sitemaps plugin doesn&#8217;t actually
generate a file. The sitemap is simply a
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/sitemap.xml">URL</a> which is dynamically
built, on request.</p>

<p>Now I believe this is a much neater solution. No need for the user to
specify where the file should be placed. Less work for the plugin to do.
Much cleaner. Much simpler. Credit to the author, <a href="http://andrewdasilva.com/">Andrew da
Silva</a>.</p>

<p>The lesson I learned was that just because something has always been
done that way doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean it can only be done that way.</p>

<p>P.S. If you&#8217;re worried about the performance impact of needlessly
rebuilding a sitemap, on the fly for 234,432 entries, don&#8217;t worry - some
clever individual has already implemented a cache for the sitemap data.</p>

<p>Out of morbid curiousity, I pulled over this morning to pay my respects

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Five months ago, I
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/10/31/disqus-powered-comments">experimented</a>
with <a href="http://www.disqus.com/">Disqus</a> powered comments when this blog
was running on WordPress. The trial was rather short-lived because I was
disappointed that Disqus wasn&#8217;t able to fully integrate with all the
existing blog comments. Importing comments still isn&#8217;t possible but
Disqus says this feature is being worked on.</p>

<p>However, I have decided to reinstate Disqus for the following reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>Disqus recently added
<a href="http://blog.disqus.net/2008/03/24/add-your-disqus-profile-on-friendfeed/">integration</a>
with FriendFeed so any contributions I make on Disqus powered blogs
will also be visible in my FriendFeed
<a href="http://friendfeed.com/andyc">stream</a>.</li>
<li>I am encountering an ever increasing number of blogs using Disqus.</li>
<li>I am hoping Disqus will help to trigger more comments, interest and
interaction on the blog.</li>
<li>Disqus provide a nice combination widget providing &#8216;Popular&#8217;,
&#8216;Recent Comments&#8217; and &#8216;People&#8217;.</li>
<li>The most recent
<a href="http://blog.disqus.net/2008/03/14/disqus-releases-beta-2-%E2%80%93-new-features-lots-of-bug-fixes-improved-performance/">release</a>
of Disqus included a raft of changes including support for Open ID.</li>
<li>Disqus is being actively developed and, more importantly,
<a href="http://shegeeks.net/great-quality-customer-support-with-disqus/">listen</a>
to their users.</li>
</ul>


<p>I still have some reservations that the couple of articles with decent
comment threads included replies to earlier comments (which are no
longer visible) so we are literally starting from zero. However,
hopefully some comments will appear soon and the tabs will actually
display something !</p>

<p>Aside: Unfortunately, adopting Disqus means I will no longer be using
<a href="http://mattread.com/">Matt Read</a>&#8217;s recently
<a href="http://twitter.com/MattRead/statuses/779438983">released</a>
<a href="http://www.defensio.com/">Defensio</a> plugin which is excellent and
highly recommended for any <a href="http://www.habariproject.org/en/">Habari</a>
bloggers wading through a torrent of comment spam.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s no good. I simply can&#8217;t go on. I can no longer summon up the
enthusiasm for blogging.</p>

<p>All the warnings from the blogging 101 courses over the years have
proven to be very true.</p>

<p>I foolishly dipped my toe into Twitter and then FriendFeed but it&#8217;s no
good I simply can&#8217;t go on with this any longer.</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t bear to miss my children growing up just because &#8216;Facebook is so
last year, Dad.&#8217;</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t bear to talk to my wife and be abrupt and terse simply because I
am now limited to 140 characters.</p>

<p>The time has finally come for me to declare complete 100%, unadulterated
blogging and Web 2.0 bankruptcy.</p>

<p>Thank you all from the pit of my burning, nauseous stomach for your
comments during the past years.</p>

<p>Tomorrow I will resign from Oracle Corporation and will devote the rest
of my life to my one true love.</p>

<p>Learning to play guitar well enough to cover &#8216;Country Feedback&#8217; by
R.E.M. Wish me luck.</p>

<p>Peace, love, empathy</p>

<p>The byte stream that is &#8216;Blog in Isolation&#8217;.</p>
