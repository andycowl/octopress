  <div class="entry-content"><p>I finally caved in and replaced a 15 year old Sony TV with a Panasonic
32″ LCD TV
(<a href="http://www.dabs.com/productview.aspx?Quicklinx=4HFN&amp;CategorySelectedId=11229&amp;PageMode=1&amp;NavigationKey=11229,48050000,49870000,50300">TX32LXD700</a>)
for Christmas. Although the aging Sony still worked fine, it did cycle
through Red/Green/Blue and took 5 minutes to fully warm up.</p>

<p>Before taking the plunge, I read various reviews and looked at the
televisions on my shortlist in shops. Most stores (understandably) use
High Definition (HD) broadcasts or
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluray">Blu-ray</a> discs to show the digital
technology at its best. Cartoons are another popular choice to
demonstrate LCD TV&#8217;s displaying a very high quality picture.</p>

<p>As the range and number of programs actually broadcast in <a href="http://vmhd.blogspot.com/">HD on Virgin
Media</a> is currently relatively limited, I
explicitly asked to see a conventional TV channel which was
enlightening. You could often see pixellation and blurring which was
disappointing but not wholly unexpected.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly, the Panasonic had the best picture quality both for
standard and HD programs. I could have got a better deal on the previous
model (TX32LXD70) but opted for the 700 for the better sound and
additional HDMI input (3 in total).</p>

<p>Finally, the time came to actually buy the TV but, unfortunately, I now
discovered the model was out of stock at most online retailers and good
old fashioned shops. Eventually, I found the TV in stock (1-2 days
delivery) at <a href="http://www.dabs.com/homepage.aspx">dabs.com</a> for &pound;769
including free delivery (normally &pound;25) so I placed the order and waited.</p>

<p>After placing the order, I received various helpful emails from dabs:</p>

<blockquote><p>Thank you for the order you placed with dabs.com on 01/12/07\
 which included an item or items which were out of stock at the time
of\
 order.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve just received notice of a lead time change from our supplier
which\
 affects the following product(s) included within your order:</p>

<p>Quicklinx : 4HFN\
 Manufacturer : Panasonic\
 Product : TX-32LXD700 32″ LCD TV\
 Old Estimated Delivery : 05/12/2007\
 New Estimated Delivery : 13/12/2007</p>

<p>Please note that the new estimated delivery date given above is the
best\
 possible date we can provide at this time. Rest assured that should
this\
 date move forward or backwards, we will keep you fully informed by
email.</p></blockquote>

<p>Strange. The TV wasn&#8217;t actually listed as ‘Out of stock&#8217; when I placed
the order. Worse, the projected dates kept slipping and slipping (like
an IT project) until, tantalisingly, we reached 18 December.</p>

<p>I took the precaution of printing a large picture of the LCD TV on
glossy paper and wrapped up the HDMI cable to give to Norma for her
Christmas present - ‘This is what you could have won&#8217;.</p>

<p>Finally, some good news - dabs took the payment from the credit card
which meant the TV was shipping imminently and the expensive package was
delivered just in time for Christmas.</p>

<p>I resisted the temptation to open to package to check the contents and
hook the TV up and managed to leave it propped up in the hallway until
Christmas day.</p>

<p>Connecting the Panasonic to the Virgin V+ box was easy. You just need to
buy an HDMI cable (not supplied with the TV) and modify the settings on
the V+ box to output a HD signal.</p>

<p>Using the V+ Remote, select ‘Home&#8217; followed by ‘Settings&#8217;. Then select
‘Change Display and Audio Settings&#8217;. Then select ‘TV Display Format&#8217; and
change the value to ‘Hi Def HDMI&#8217;. You can experiment with the screen
resolution by changing the value of ‘V+ Box HiDef Output&#8217; but I found
the optimal setting was ‘1080′.</p>

<p>Currently, Virgin Media only carries one High Definition channel (BBC
HD) but the picture quality is simply staggering. We watched ‘Extras&#8217;
and ‘Robin Hood&#8217; on HD and were able to compare and contrast the picture
with conventional BBC1 (as both programs were broadcast simultaneously).
The picture is absolutely razor sharp and has a sense of ‘depth&#8217;.</p>

<p>Watching conventional channels is a bit of a come-down after HD but my
fears that a conventional TV broadcast (albeit upscaled) would actually
be inferior to the 15 year old Sony set were unfounded.</p>

<p>Having said that, the picture quality does depend on the program. Fast
moving images (like sports) are still prone to pixellation and blurring
which is irritating given the amount of football I watch. The good news
is that the England friendly international in February should be
available on BBC HD so it will be interesting to see how the quality
differs.</p>

<p>The V+ box solely uses the HDMI cable to connect to the Panasonic so I
connected the DVD player using the Scart cable and the LCD TV has
breathed new life into my DVD collection.</p>

<p>There is also a SD card slot for viewing digital photos which now show
up every single blemish in full colour 32″ glory and Norman Jnr is
delighted as he can also connect the Xbox 360 via a handy HDMI slot on
the front panel and again, the picture quality, as he saves the world,
destroying zombies with a flame thrower and hand held rocket launcher,
is superb.</p>

<p>Overall, I am delighted with the Panasonic LCD TV and I find myself
watching wildlife documentaries on BBC HD just to admire the astounding
picture quality.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just placed a Christmas present under the tree. Had a sneaky look at the
tag to see whether a shake, rattle and roll was necessary. I was very
surprised and somewhat upset to read:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>January - Andy Murray reaches the quarter finals of the Australian Open
but mysteriously withdraws citing a &#8216;bad hair day&#8217;. An inquiry is
immediately launched into irregular gambling patterns preceding the
match and his choice of shampoo. Manchester United triumph 7-4 in a
thrilling FA cup-tie at Villa Park.</p>

<p>February - England beat Switzerland 5-0 at Wembley in a friendly. Frank
Lampard scores a goal that is not deflected. Fabio Capello is hailed as
a footballing genius</p>

<p>March - Liverpool lose 2-0 to Inter Milan in the Champions League.
Rafael Benitez&#8217;s head explodes. Andrew Flintoff is reinstated as England
captain and Ian Botham is appointed Chairman of Selectors after the pair
clinch victory in the opening test against New Zealand. The Kiwi side
are later found drifting on a orange pedalo, kept afloat by empty kegs
of beer. The New Zealand cricket board are fined $5,000 for the late
return of the hire vessel.</p>

<p>April - Paula Radcliffe astounds the athletics world by giving birth to
her second child at the 23 mile marker in the London marathon. Radcliffe
finishes the race in a creditable 5th place.</p>

<p>May - Arsenal win the Premiership. Jens Lehmann wins the prestigious
David May award for &#8216;Best fringe player who intrudes on celebrations and
gets in all the photos&#8217; award.</p>

<p>June - Rioting is reporting in Liverpool, Newcastle, Birmingham and East
London by football fans with no major football tournament to attend.</p>

<p>July - In a bizarre twist, Tiger Woods wins the British Grand Prix and
Lewis Hamilton wins the British Open while filming for the reality TV
series &#8216;Faking It&#8217;.</p>

<p>August - Great Britain win a solitary gold medal in the Bejing Olympics.</p>

<p>September - England lose 1-0 away to Kazakhstan in the opening World Cup
qualifier. Fabio Capello is derided by the press as a hapless Italian
ice-cream salesman, dismissed by the FA who appoint an Englishman
(Borat) as his replacement.</p>

<p>October - After a poor start to the season, that leaves Chelsea hovering
over the relegation zone, Roman Abramovich jettisons Avram Grant as
manager, takes responsibility for team affairs, appoints Shevchenko as
assistant manager and immediately signs Kaka, Ronaldinho, Ronaldo,
Fabregas and Jens Lehmann.</p>

<p>November - Rafa Benitez is appointed manager of Lyon in a dream
partnership with Gerard Houlier. French media carries reports that the
two men have never been sighted in the same place at the same time.</p>

<p>December - England beat Belarus 2-1 in a World Cup Qualifier. Borat is
hailed as a footballing genius and the media salute England&#8217;s golden age
who will surely lift the World Cup in South Africa.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&#8230;from Surrey Traffic Police. Unfortunately, my
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/02/15/undercover-with-surrey-traffic-police/">friends</a>
appear to have sent me a &#8216;Notice of Intended Prosecution&#8217; instead of
their customary Yuletide greetings card.</p>

<p>I wrote and told them I had been a very good boy all year long. Well, a
very good boy apart from my recent brush with their
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/11/21/a-brush-with-the-met/">colleagues</a>
from the London branch.</p>

<p>Assuming Surrey Traffic Police content themselves with another fixed
penalty notice and 3 points, this is quite inconvenient for me as this
takes my tally to 9 points so I will now have to drive like an old man
wearing a trilby hat. This will last for a full seven months when my
current points start to expire.</p>

<p>I scrawled my own festive greeting on the non postage paid return
envelope which I hope I don&#8217;t live to regret.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;Merry Xmas to all at Surrey Traffic Police. You are all doing a great
job.&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>So, if you are stuck behind me and wonder why is that idiot driving
below the speed limit, please accept my apologies but you can blame
Surrey Traffic Police.</p>

<p>Maybe I should hire this

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A week savouring the joys of commuting to Waterloo on South West Trains.
Oxford Street is packed, the Christmas lights are on, the temporary ice
rinks are open and lots of people are enjoying Christmas parties.
Inevitably romance, as well as alcohol, is in the air.</p>

<p>I am fairly shy and reserved so I took the opportunity to place a couple
of small
<a href="http://www.thelondonpaper.com/cs/Satellite/london/love?packedargs=categoryId=1154364220692&amp;date=null">ads</a>
in the wonderful London Paper and am eagerly awaiting a couple of calls
and an early Christmas present next week.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;Monday night. District Line train to Wimbledon. You - beautiful,
blonde hair, long coat, stylish scarf. Me - semi-comatose,
dishevelled, drinking a can of Special Brew, pretending to read &#8216;C#
for beginners&#8217;. Drink ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Tuesday night. Clapham Junction. 9pm. I was train-spotting on
platform 11. You disembarked the 20:47 from Waterloo to Guildford. I
informed you this service was delayed by 3 minutes 22 seconds due to a
person being taken ill at Vauxhall. I then tried to tell you this
locomotive had recently been serviced at Wimbledon Train Care Depot
but you hurriedly walked away. Drink ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Wednesday night. 01:55 Milk train to Portsmouth. Cute brunette who
chose to sit next to me but was too nervous to say anything. I was
desperately trying to remember what I had told the CEO at the office
party. I fell asleep, snored and mistakenly lolled onto your shoulder.
You smiled. Nervously. I missed my stop at Surbiton and ended up in
Gosport. You laughed. Drink ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Thursday night. Football club party. Stunning blonde who stood next
to me under the Waterloo clock waiting for the 23:59 to Wokingham. I
was wearing shorts, white T-shirt with fake breasts and a reindeer hat
complete with flashing lights and antlers.
I smiled and hicupped. A lot. You frowned and stared out the window
while I tried to make eye contact. I asked you: &#8216;Excuse me, but do you
happen to know whether this train is stopping at Chessington South ?&#8217;
I was transfixed by your beauty. At Raynes Park, your boyfriend said
&#8216;What do you think you&#8217;re looking at, mate ?&#8217; and viciously attacked
me. Drink ?&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>Friday. Discharged from casualty with seven stitches. Called in sick.
Quiet night in with the wife.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I always was led to believe that Bobby Charlton and George Best didn&#8217;t
get on. I read it in books and interviews and heard it from various
different sources. Of course, this fact wasn&#8217;t a total surprise as the
two gentlemen did appear to be completely different personalities with
rather contrasting interests and, err, hobbies.</p>

<p>A month ago, I saw Charlton interviewed by Michael Parkinson where he
recounted his memories of the Munich air crash. Charlton also talked
about the frustration of playing alongside Best:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;So I made a run forward &#8216;Pass it George, pass it.&#8217; George dribbles
down the wing and cuts back inside. I move into space. &#8216;Here George -
pass it here. Now&#8217;. George continues on a mazy run past another three
defenders. I move into the box &#8216;George - come on. For God&#8217;s sake, pass
it now - oh what a great goal, George.&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>Then Bobby Charlton recalled visiting Best with Dennis Law during his
final days in a London hospital. Best was drugged and drifting in and
out of consciousness and didn&#8217;t recognise his two friends. Bobby
Charlton had tears in his eyes and his voice was quivering. It really
was an incredibly moving and emotional moment.
So, if anyone tells you Bobby Charlton hated George Best, just ask them
to watch that interview.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Monday 3 December</p>

<p>Get up very early and drive to Birmingham.</p>

<p>09:40-10:30 &#8216;30 years at Oracle&#8217; - Tom Kyte. I own a couple of Kyte&#8217;s
excellent books and various sources report he is an excellent speaker.</p>

<p>10:40-11:00 Visit a few stands. A quick game of &#8216;spot the colleague&#8217; and
ask 27 different companies &#8216;How can XYZ help me grow my business ?&#8217;</p>

<p>11:15-12:00 &#8216;Siebel Keynote&#8217; - David Mills. Possible sales and marketing
fluff alert. Need to sit at the back adjacent to an aisle to allow a
potential rapid escape to &#8216;Oracle RAC versus Oracle Data Guard - which
should I use for Disaster Recovery and which should I use for High
Availability ?&#8217;.</p>

<p>12:25-13:20 &#8216;Under the Covers of Oracle BI Suite Enterprise Edition
Plus&#8217; - Mick Bull/Lisa Dobson. I would like to learn more about Oracle&#8217;s

<p>13:15-14:15 &#8216;TimesTen: Anatomy of an In-Memory Database&#8217; - Chris Jenkins

<p>14:15-15:15 &#8216;Remote Hand Held SFA solutions need housekeeping - Ian
Keleher/Nicola Burrows (Gallaher). A verbose and hardly compelling title
but I have worked with this customer so I might get a mention on the

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Occasionally, people take the time to comment on this blog which is
always welcome.</p>

<p>However, the vast majority of comments however are not so thinly veiled
advertisements by spammers. Unfortunately, due to recent
<a href="http://andyc.tumblr.com/post/17830528">problems</a> with <a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/07/10/out-with-the-old-in-with-the-new/">Spam
Karma</a>,
I have had to revert to <a href="http://akismet.com/">Akismet</a> to block this
torrent of pharmaceutical, financial, pornographic and <a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2005/12/19/probably-the-best-comment-spam-in-the-world/">vacuum
cleaner</a>
spam.</p>

<p>This means I have a few more comments held in moderation for judgement.
The family convene every night with a cup of Horlicks to sit in
judgement on the assorted comments. Norma kindy takes the minutes and
Norman Junior twitters the whole event (live).</p>

<p>The &#8216;Comment Approval Board&#8217; recently approved a comment from a heavy
metal fan. We took care to follow Akismet&#8217;s
<a href="http://blog.akismet.com/2007/11/27/it-really-is-spam/">advice</a> and
checked the <a href="http://heavy-blog.com/">link</a> which purported that &#8216;Heavy
Metal is our life&#8217;.</p>

<p>Approving this was not an easy choice but hey, this is a broad church
and everyone is welcome.</p>

<p>When I subsequently happened to scan the <a href="http://sezwho.com/">SezWho</a>
<a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/nbrightside/Blog/photo#5138181312931498338">profile</a>
of the author (a man with the unusual name of &#8216;HeavyGod&#8217;), I found to my
horror, that he (or a program) had left the identical comment on
multiple blogs.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;Really good and really interesting post. I expect (and other readers
maybe :)) new useful posts from you! Good luck and successes in
blogging!&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>The clues were all there. Commenting on a recent post sandwiched between
other valid comments, a gmail address, the double use of &#8216;really&#8217;, the
smiley, the compliment that I naively fell for. Hook, line and sinker.</p>

<p>I had been tricked. By a heavy metal fan. Oh the eternal shame.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After a detailed, comprehensive &#8217;<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/7100393.stm">root and
branch</a>&#8217;
inspection, the English FA have discovered that the organisation bears
no resemblence to a national Football Association and is, in fact, a
Christmas tree - a mid-range Norwegian pine (non-drop) to be precise.</p>

<p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/7108835.stm">MS Explorer</a> is
listing badly. Passengers have been advised to disembark and board
Mozilla Firefox instead.</p>

<p>Croatia may have beaten England twice twice in the qualifying campaign
but never mind. At least the marvellous Ing-er-land fans booed their
national anthem to motivate their players and the singer improvised an
amusing
<a href="http://www.whoateallthepies.tv/2007/11/croatian_nation.html">change</a> to
the verse.</p>

<p>Applications for annual leave during the summer of 2008 are now open
again and overtime is no longer required for policemen and riot squads
in Austria and Switzerland.</p>
