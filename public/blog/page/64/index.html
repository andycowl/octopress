  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just booked a flight to Oslo and noticed that under &#8216;Meal Options&#8217;
alongside &#8216;Vegetarian&#8217;, &#8216;Non-dairy&#8217; and various religious preferences
was the intriguing option of &#8216;Bland&#8217; so of course I immediately selected
it.</p>

<p>I simply can not imagine how plastic airline fare could be made any more
bland.</p>

<p>Will a cabin stewardess really waltz down the aisles demanding &#8216;Did
anyone ask for a bland meal ?&#8217;</p>

<p>Stay tuned.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Doug&#8217;s
<a href="http://oracledoug.com/serendipity/index.php?/archives/779-Rotterdam.html">post</a>
about early memories of attending football matches got me thinking.</p>

<p>Years ago, I was a LMTB (League Match Ticket Book) holder at Manchester
United and went to every home game at Old Trafford. An LMTB was similar
to a season ticket but only entitled the holder to attend League Matches
with no priority for FA Cup tickets.</p>

<p>Consequently, whenever United got to the latter stages of the FA Cup,
there was a black market in the Manchester Evening News for the little
numbered tokens that were printed in the matchday program. You needed a
large number of tokens (including reserve games) to get a ticket.</p>

<p>However, my father was a bank manager and then, as now, the majority of
tickets for big football matches went to corporate hospitality rather
then the true fans.</p>

<p>So, on Saturday April 3 1976, on a beautiful sunny day, my Dad and I
crossed the Pennines to see United play Derby in the FA Cup Semi Final
at Hillsborough.</p>

<p>The tickets had &#8216;Exeter FC&#8217; imprinted on the back and we were in the
wrong end (Spion Kop) and all the United fans were at Leppings Lane but
none of that mattered. I was so excited and nervous, I could barely
converse properly.</p>

<p>We got into the ground early to watch the ground slowly fill up, soak up
the atmosphere and enjoy the fans taunting each other. Inevitably, there
were pockets of United fans scattered on the massive, steep terrace at
Hillsborough.</p>

<p>United had a young team, managed by Tommy Docherty and were riding high
in their first year back in Division 1 after promotion and Derby were
the reigning champions.</p>

<p>Gerry Daly gave United the lead in the first half but my main abiding
memory of this game was late in the second half when United were awarded
a free-kick at our end. Gordon Hill stepped up and produced a swerving,
curling free-kick past the despairing hands of the Derby keeper into the
corner. 2-0 to United ! The ground exploded, the noise was unbelievable
and the whole stadium was a moving sea of red and white.</p>

<p>When the game ended, United fans invaded the pitch to celebrate.
Inevitably, a significant minority came to the Kop end to taunt the
Derby fans. Some Derby fans responded and joined them on the pitch and
the press carried pictures of the resulting &#8216;ugly scenes&#8217;. I can vividly
remember trying to leave the ground and taking refuge in a concrete
backwater as United fans started to get onto the Kop terrace and most
peace loving supporters desperately tried to get away from the chaos.</p>

<p>All in all, a fantastic day out.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Look at this gentleman&#8217;s very amusing
<a href="http://www.linkedin.com/profile?viewProfile=&amp;key=274536&amp;goback=.con_2">profile</a>
on <a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/03/03/linkedincom/">LinkedIn</a>.</p>

<p>Look at his modest, self-deprecating description - &#8216;I hate it when our
friends become successful&#8217;. Such a refreshing change from some of the
pretentiousness you usually find.</p>

<p>This is the title of one of my favourite Morrissey songs. If only space
had permitted the author to add &#8216;especially when they&#8217;re Northern&#8217;.</p>

<p>Now look at his employment record and the impressive list of high
powered job roles he has fulfilled for major blue chips in an exciting
and varied career spanning over 20 years in IT:</p>

<ul>
<li>Junior Programmer (AmberPoint)</li>
<li>Dogsbody (Kenamea)</li>
<li>Ringleader (Sun)</li>
<li>Plumber (Forte)</li>
<li>Fitter (Sybase)</li>
<li>Jack of All Trades (Ingres)</li>
</ul>


<p>Now take a look at the same gentleman&#8217;s
<a href="http://andrewsherman.blogspot.com/">blog</a> and profile picture. At last,
you have encountered an American with a sense of humour.</p>

<p>Until you realise he&#8217;s another music and football loving Brit who
crossed the water.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Prizegiving ceremonies at school are a similar experience when you are a
parent as when you were a child.</p>

<p>The event seems to last a long time. The tedium is punctuated by the
odd, brief moment of excitement when little Norma (or someone loosely
known to you) walks up to receive her book token.</p>

<p>Your mind starts to wander asking such important questions as: &#8216;What
exactly did Christine Baverstock-Davis do to merit the award of
&#8220;Outstanding effort in &#8216;resistant materials&#8221; ?&#8217;. Did she spend countless
hours after school bashing iron, steel and rocks with hammers, mallets
and pickaxes ?&#8217; You start to wonder why your wife neglected to attend
this years 3 hour marathon in stifling heat. Must remind her that it&#8217;s
her turn next year.</p>

<p>Of course, as a parent, you feel immensely proud when your child steps
up for their book tokens on three separate occasions (Exceptional
Student, Effort in Food Technology and Surrey Schools Trampolining). In
fact, you are so proud, you nudge your two immediate neighbours urging
them to clap a little bit louder.</p>

<p>You furtively reach for those humourous red and white inflatable hands
with England flags on and raise them aloft. As your offspring is
carefully marshalled back though the aisles by a prefect to their
assigned seat, they look absolutely mortifed, go beetroot red and
whisper &#8216;Dad - put those down - NOW&#8217;.</p>

<p>Two hours later, just as the keynote speaker (first ever Head Girl from
1964) nervously steps up for the main speech, there is a kerfuffle
outside as some ruffian runs past the open double-doors singing &#8216;Ole -
Ole - Ole - Ole. Eng-LAND. Eng-LAND&#8217;. You smile to yourself as six
teachers simultaneously arise from their seats and run menacingly (while
skillfully appearing to be walking fast) to identify and silence the
culprit (using force).</p>

<p>You decide to seek the individual out later, give him a lift to hospital
and reward him with the inflatable England gloves.</p>

<p>After the event, you are once again immensely proud when your child
tells you:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;Dad - when Alistair Barnstormworth did that stupid singing outside, I
started to laugh. When I looked round. you were the only mum or dad in
the whole hall of 700 people who was also laughing.&#8217;</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Occasionally, I have had the odd dig at the parochial, inward looking
nature of the US TV
and<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/06/14/the-imminent-death-of-newspapers/">printed</a>
media.</p>

<p>However, last week, the UK media commemorated the first anniversary of
the July bombings in London with endless pages of words and pictures
together with and hours of footage, analysis, interviews, documentaries
and coverage of yet another two minute silence.</p>

<p>Since August 1997, a nation that was once renown for a &#8216;stiff upper lip&#8217;
and dignity has somehow been transformed into 60 million professional
grievers and bereavement counsellors.</p>

<p>This week, four times as many people lose their
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/south_asia/2006/mumbai_train_attacks/default.stm">lives</a>
in Mumbai in a set of horrendous train bombings by terrorists. Curiously
enough, this story is buried on page 13 after important updates on
corrupt politicians, corrupt businessman and corrupt footballers.</p>

<p>I presume all the people affected by this tragedy in India also have
mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters, sons and daughters, so put down
your paper, turn the radio off and spare a thought for them. May all the
victims rest in peace.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>On message <a href="http://www.losttv-forum.com/forum/">boards</a> and
<a href="http://www.filmfodder.com/tv/lost/">blogs</a> around the interweb, fans of
the TV series &#8217;<a href="http://abc.go.com/primetime/lost/index.html">Lost</a>&#8217; are
discussing the many, different storylines speculating about what is
actually going on and proposing far fetched theories.</p>

<p>One such undercurrent is the periodic entry of a secret code &#8216;4 8 15 16
23 42&#8217; into a computer located in an undergound bunker. People want to
know what will happen if the code is not entered.</p>

<p>Warning: Spoiler ahead. I know this because yesterday I failed to get
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/07/11/lost-life-mirrors-fiction/">there</a>
in time&#8230;</p>

<p>A corporate screensaver appears displaying perplexing, enigmatic, dark,
cryptic words which, in turn, only fuels more mystery and suspense&#8230;</p>

<blockquote><p>We lead by example\
 We work together\
 We respect the individual\
 We seek the facts and provide insight\
 We are open and honest in our communication\
 We are committed to our communities\
 Above all, we act with integrity</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When I visit customers, I am usually granted read-access to production
servers. Mostly I am working closely with IT staff to explain what I am
doing and why. I am not normally granted the passwords to administer the
production system which is just the way I like it.</p>

<p>Otherwise, Siebel server CRMPROD1 which has been working fine for 2
years, unexpectedly core dumps, the call center is down, the business is
losing 2 million dollars every minute and everyone is staring
inquiringly in your direction.</p>

<p>Occasionally, the screensaver kicks in after a predefined interval. So
the person has to unlock the screen. However, if the person is in a
meeting or otherwise unavailable, the screen remains locked until he
returns. This can waste valuable time so I prefer to keep the screen
accessible at all times, if at all possible.</p>

<p>Consequently, I find myself acting like John
<a href="http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/L/lost/locke.html">Locke</a>
in &#8217;<a href="http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/L/lost/">Lost</a>&#8217;
who has to strike a key on the keyboard of a computer every 2 hours to
avoid dire (yet unknown) consequences.</p>

<p>So, don&#8217;t be surprised if you are working with an Oracle consultant who
nervously keeps looking at his watch during a fascinating conversation
about Siebel architecture. If he then rudely and abruptly terminates the
dialog by hurtling back to his temporary desk and launches into a
desperate, full length, athletic dive across the room to desperately hit
a random key, that&#8217;s why.</p>

Robert <a href="http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/">Scoble</a> is an intelligent chap
but has some truly bizarre thoughts. This
<a href="http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/2006/07/09/hdtv-will-make-soccer-a-lot-more-popular-in-america/">theory</a>
is perhaps the most bizarre of all.</p>

<p>Playing is better than watching. Watching in the ground is better than
HDTV. HDTV is better than TV. Watching on TV is (sometimes) better than
listening on the radio.</p>

<p>To achieve success at &#8216;soccer&#8217;, you actually need to run around on a
field not slump in front of TV with four gallons of soda and a mountain
of cheesy nachos. If the latter was the criteria, England would surely
have lifted the last two World Cups and European Championships.</p>
