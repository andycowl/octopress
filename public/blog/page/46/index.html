  <div class="entry-content"><p>Another thing on my todo list was to learn PHP and write a WordPress
plugin to randomly select quotes stored in the database to rotate the
tagline.</p>

<p>An admin interface to create, modify and delete quotes was planned for
Version 2.1 (beta) due Q4 2008.</p>

<p>Fortunately for me though, a helpful person called Zombie Robot
(pseudonym ?) has already produced
<a href="http://www.zombierobot.com/wp-quotes/">wp-quotes</a> (and another kind
person <a href="http://hangoversunday.com/?p=260">tweaked</a> it to work properly
for taglines).</p>

<p>All that remains is the interesting part - performance tuning. No -
wait. Existing users have already identified this
<a href="http://www.zombierobot.com/archives/optimizing-wp-quotes/">modification</a>
as efficiently fetching a single, random record. Horribly database
specific of course but worth having when you have 2.4 million quotes.</p>

<pre><code>36c36
&lt; $sql = "select * from " . WP_QUOTES_TABLE . " where visible='yes'
&lt; order by rand() limit 1";
---
&gt; $sql = "select * from " . WP_QUOTES_TABLE . " where visible='yes'";

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Doug <a href="http://oracledoug.com/serendipity/">Burns</a> has a new
<a href="http://oracledoug.com/serendipity/index.php?/archives/1168-A-Fresh-Start.html">job</a>
and is spending some time in Canada, hugging his new colleagues. Like
most roving consultants holed up in lonely, bland, nondescript hotel
rooms with only an ironing board, TV and mini-bar for company (oh sorry
that&#8217;s me not Doug), Doug&#8217;s thoughts inevitably starts to turn to loved
ones back at home (including his cuddly toys and music collection).</p>

<p>Fed up with the banality of Radio Ottawa, Doug recently pleaded for
<a href="http://oracledoug.com/serendipity/index.php?/archives/1185-Singing-Songs.html">suggestions</a>
and recommendations for new music. Unfortunately this desperate plea
met with a deathly silence from Oracle types purely interested in his
detailed investigations into the optimal degree of
<a href="http://oracledoug.com/serendipity/index.php?/archives/835-PX-and-the-Magic-of-2.html">parallelism</a>.</p>

<p>More recently, it would appear that homesickness coupled with the
extreme
<a href="http://oracledoug.com/serendipity/index.php?/archives/1189-A-Bit-Brisk,-Eh.html">cold</a>
is affecting his brain. He is now listening to &#8217;<a href="http://oracledoug.com/serendipity/index.php?/archives/1190-While-The-Chief-....html">The
Proclaimers</a>&#8217;
and viewing questionable videos on YouTube.</p>

<p>So, to preserve poor Doug&#8217;s sanity and seed some new ideas, I have
painstakingly recorded full details of my vinyl record
<a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=pHBwkjgvEIx7p__epg6YXYg">collection</a>which
was sold to a second hand record shop last January for &pound;20.</p>

<p>Obviously, this eclectic collection merely reflects my antique
collection of vinyl so I also resurrected my last.fm
<a href="http://www.last.fm/user/andycowl/">account</a> in an effort to reflect
more recent musical tastes.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for a complete listing of all my bootleg tapes in the next
exciting edition.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In recent weeks, this esteemed publication (Daily Excess) has been
critical of Wayne Rooney&#8217;s recent performances for Manchester United.</p>

<p>One article &#8216;Rooney is finished&#8217; questioned his future, his commitment,
his mental state and his footballing ability. We ran a story that
incorrectly claimed Rooney was &#8216;furious and livid&#8217; at the amount of
media attention, fulsome praise and PFA awards being given to his
team-mate and rival, Cristiano Ronaldo.</p>

<p>After his performance and two wonder goals on Saturday, the Daily Excess
is proud to announce an unreserved, unequivocal and heartfelt apology to
Wayne (John, Paul, Ringo, George) Rooney of Wilmslow, Cheshire.</p>

<p>Wayne Rooney is the best footballer in <del>England</del> the world. Wayne
Rooney is destined to enjoy a long and trophy-filled career for club and
country. John Terry has a dodgy back so must be relieved of the England
captaincy immediately and the honour bestowed on &#8216;our Wayne&#8217;. Wayne
Rooney will bring the World Cup back home in 2010.</p>

<p>Rival publications have compared Wayne to Eric Cantona. That comparison
is grossly unfair. Wayne Rooney is infinitely better than that garlic
smelling, poetry reading, snail eating, karate kicking Frenchman who
can&#8217;t even speak English proper.</p>

<p>Wayne Rooney is a fantastic footballer and an awesome young talent to be
nurtured and savoured.</p>

<p>Until he next goes four games without a goal.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was intrigued by the detailed infrastructure and sophisticated AI
techniques powering the &#8216;world-wide computer network&#8217; that was
supposedly hunting down my
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/01/24/lost-in-transit/">lost</a> bag.</p>

<p>I had a persistent mental image of a person sitting in a dingy, dark
corner office buried in the dungeons at Heathrow airport, lazily typing
into an old-fashioned, amber, VT220 terminal:</p>

<p>Bag Reference: &#8216;AHL LHRBD70414&#8217;</p>

<p>BRU-LHR: Confirm : &#8216;Yes&#8217;</p>

<p>Is the bag at BRU ? : &#8216;No&#8217;</p>

<p>Is the bag at LHR ? : &#8216;Dunno&#8217;</p>

<p>Is the bag stuck on the conveyor belt ? : &#8216;Dunno&#8217;</p>

<p>Did some idiotic passenger take the wrong bag ? : &#8216;Possibly&#8217;</p>

<p>Has the bag been delivered to another carousel (Bug 6695423) ? : &#8216;No&#8217;</p>

<p>Have you asked Barry, the baggage handler Supervisor ? : &#8216;Yes&#8217;</p>

<p>Have you looked behind the sofa ? : &#8216;Yes. No bag but we did find the TV
remote.&#8217;</p>

<p>Computer says: &#8216;Tell customer the search has now been widened to US and
APAC. Wait 3 months before telling the customer it is now too late to
submit an insurance claim.&#8217;</p>

<p>The illusion has just been cruelly shattered. In the early hours, I
received a text message</p>

<p>&#8216;Luggage received. Delivery time will follow.&#8217;</p>

<p>promptly followed by another</p>

<p>&#8216;Your luggage should be delivered before 10:00&#8217;</p>

<p>Half an hour ago, the doorbell rang and I was reunited with my razor and
boxer shorts. Much to the surprise of the delivery driver, we hugged and
enjoyed an emotional, tearful reunion.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I had to tear up the fraudulent insurance claim for a new
digital camera, Timberland boots, iPod, wireless headphones, Treo, 3
crates of chocolates, Hercule Poirot moustache, full size replica of the
<a href="http://www.atomium.be/HTMLsite/dyn/eindex.html">Atomium</a> and electric
guitar.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Sort of.</p>

<p>I decided to remove all posts from my newly created Habari
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/habari/">sandbox</a> in case my readership and
GoogleBot gets confused. As there was no obvious bulk deletion tool, I
simply truncated the `wp_posts` table.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I truncated the `wp_posts` table from the Wordpress
schema instead of the Habari schema.</p>

<p>So, in the space of a mere 24 hours, I had managed to
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/01/24/lost-in-transit/">lose</a> my
favourite boxer shorts, get a brand new shiny blog and then completely
trash my established, trusty, stable blog.</p>

<p>No problem. Earlier today I upgraded to WordPress 2.1 so I can use the
backup I carefully took before that upgrade. Only the Bluehost one-click
upgrades are so reliable and trouble-free, I got out of the excellent
habit of taking my own backup by hand.</p>

<p>No problem. I will just use the backup Bluehost took automatically. Only
I can&#8217;t. That backup is purely of the PHP code (and not the database).</p>

<p>No problem. I will simply use the Bluehost mySQL database backup. Only I
can&#8217;t. Murphy has spoken. The latest daily backup has been made in the
last 2 hours and the `wp_posts` table is empty.</p>

<p>No problem. I will go back to the weekly dump, extract the SQL for
`wp_posts` in isolation and add the raw data by executing the INSERT
statements.</p>

<p>That all works fine. 502 records inserted into `wp_posts`.
Triumphantly, I pat myself on the back and check the blog looks OK.
There are still no articles. Weird.</p>

<p>I create a test article, which is visible, and compare the &#8216;good&#8217; record
against the &#8216;bad&#8217; record. Quickly track the problem to the &#8216;post_type&#8217;
column which is NULL on the imported posts and should be &#8216;post&#8217;. Issue
the necessary UPDATE statement and, magically, all my posts immediately
re-appear. Fix the &#8216;About&#8217; page which imaginatively has a &#8216;post_type&#8217;
of &#8216;page&#8217;.</p>

<p>All that remains is to fill in the gap between last week&#8217;s backup by
manually pasting in articles from Google Reader and modifying the
timestamps. Slightly tedious but much preferable to laboriously typing
in 501 articles.</p>

<p>And the moral of this tale. If I ever cross your threshold to be
interviewed for that production DBA role for a large Siebel deployment,
just thank me and politely show me the door. Quickly.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s been a lot of
<a href="http://www.brokenkode.com/archives/habari/">excitement</a> and
<a href="http://www.bloggingpro.com/archives/2007/01/08/habari-a-new-blogging-tool/">discussion</a>
recently about the
<a href="http://www.skippy.net/blog/2007/01/09/spread-the-news/">emergence</a> of a
new blogging platform called <a href="http://code.google.com/p/habari/">Habari</a>.</p>

<p>A brand new blogging platform being created from scratch with more
developers than actual blogs.The prospect of my blog being completely
broken by the nightly alpha build was an attractive one. A chance to
leave the comfort of a stable Wordpress environment with all those
themes and plugins. A change to live on the bleeding edge. I desperately
tried to resist but the lure was too strong. In the end, I simply
couldn&#8217;t help myself.</p>

<p>The first step was to install
<a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">subversion</a> (much better name than
boring old
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_Versions_System">CVS</a>) on
Bluehost following these excellent, idiot-proof
<a href="http://blog.matharvard.com/2006/11/16/installing-subversion">instructions</a>.</p>

<p>Then you check out the habari code. Or rather you don&#8217;t. You get this
error.</p>

<pre><code>svn: PROPFIND request failed on '/svn/trunk'
svn: No transaction named '26572b6d78b0be18? in filesystem 'habari'
</code></pre>

<p>No need to give up and commit Hari-Kari just yet. Consult the Habari
self-help <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/habari-users/topics">group</a> to
discover there is a known
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/habari-users/browse_frm/thread/6a6e87237e9201a0/00532b95a7212ee1#00532b95a7212ee1">problem</a>
with the SVN repository on the Google server. When this problem is
resolved, I finally get to download the code.
Habari requires PHP5 and PDO (for database access). On Bluehost, the
following lines must be added to &#8216;php.ini&#8217; to activate the PDO drivers
for mySQL.</p>

<pre><code>extension_dir = /usr/lib/php/extensions/no-debug-non-zts-20050922
extension=pdo.so
extension=pdo_mysql.so
</code></pre>

<p>I am already hosted on a server running PHP5 but if you don&#8217;t have PHP5
on your server, open a ticket and Bluehost Technical Support will
promptly move you.</p>

<p>Create a(nother) mySQL database and account, edit the database
credentials in &#8216;config.php&#8217;, create an &#8216;.htaccess&#8217; file to handle
redirects and you&#8217;re away. A simple installation page creates the
initial user account, the blog, tagline and the first entry.</p>

<p>Congratulations ! You are now the proud owner of a Habari
<a href="http://flickr.com/photos/70276096@N00/368029092/">blog</a>.</p>

<p>Obviously, this is an embryonic product but the
<a href="http://flickr.com/photos/70276096@N00/368029093/in/photostream/">Administration</a>
page looks great and is fast and responsive. Although I&#8217;m not sure I
believe the traffic statistics !</p>

<p>The article
<a href="http://flickr.com/photos/70276096@N00/368029099/in/photostream/">editor</a>
is a little minimalistic (especially contrasted with the recently
released WordPress 2.1) but perfectly usable.</p>

<p>A special word of praise about the Habari
<a href="http://flickr.com/photos/70276096@N00/368029095/in/photostream/">import</a>
facility.</p>

<p>This connected directly to my Wordpress database and was blindingly fast
(less than 30 seconds) to import my WordPress blog. In fact, it was so
fast, I had to check that over 500 articles and 400 comments were indeed
correctly imported although I noted that tags weren&#8217;t preserved.</p>

<p>It is not clear how you might import a hosted Wordpress blog where you
don&#8217;t have access to the database but I am sure other data formats will
be added in due course.</p>

<p>Of course, there isn&#8217;t the rich variety of themes and plugins available
for Habari (yet) and, while I will not be jumping ship to Habari from
WordPress today, I will certainly continue to follow developments with
interest.</p>

<p>Auto-discovery detected the availability RSD and Atom (but not RSS)
feeds.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re interested, here is my Habari

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last night I returned to London from Brussels. Unfortunately, my
overnight bag didn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>I guess this was inevitable after four years of multiple short flights
in Europe and I have been pretty lucky thus far.</p>

<p>Curiously, two other passengers on my flight suffered the same fate. One
gentleman was very irate. For reasons best known to himself, he had
buried his car keys in his suitcase which seemed a very odd decision.</p>

<p>Consequently, he had to call his wife in Oxford to drive down to
Heathrow with the spare keys. I happened to notice he held his mobile
phone a full 12 inches from his ear while he made the call to his loving
partner. Hopefully, the box of expensive Belgian chocolates he was
carrying, may help to salvage the situation.</p>

<p>My immediate thought was the stray bags were lurking somewhere in
Heathrow Terminal 1 whereas my new friend and ally seemed convinced that
they had never left Brussels. He was insistent that Hercule Poirot was
summoned immediately to locate the bags in Brussels and placed on the
20:00 flight (in business class with cloth napkins).</p>

<p>My gut instinct was reinforced when four more passengers from Amsterdam
came over to report more lost bags. Again, from the now sadly empty
luggage carousel 4. Maybe there was something interesting on TV or a
baggage handler had popped out for more tea-bags.</p>

<p>Ironically, I was deputising at short notice for a sick colleague so
this flight was booked at very short notice in business class. So, the
bright orange &#8216;Prioritaire&#8217; tag didn&#8217;t exactly help my kit bag much on
this occasion.</p>

<p>Anyway, I remain hopeful of getting my smelly clothes and stolen hotel
toiletries back; particularly when I read this bold assertion on the BMI
claim form</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;We would like to assure you that every effort is being made to locate
your bag using a world-wide computer network designed exclusively for
this purpose.&#8217;</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>27 years ago, in an fruitless attempt to save money, my wife and I hired
a function room above a pub to celebrate our joint 40th birthday. With a
free bar.</p>

<p>We invited friends (both of them), members of the book club and close
family, blew up our own red and white balloons, paid extortionate prices
for prawn volavons and, in an extravagant measure, even hired a DJ with
a Karaoke machine.</p>

<p>In an effort to get things going, I submitted my request at 21:39 (Oasis
- Wonderwall)</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the premium strength lager on offer that night was
Kronenburg 1664 (not Grolsch).</p>

<p>At 23:57, I was summoned to the stage where I grabbed the microphone and
prepared for my moment of glory.</p>

<p>I eagerly sang out the words on the monitor screen</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;Introduction. Introduction..&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>The middle-aged DJ&#8217;s looked aghast and frantically started gesturing to
me.
I kept going to a round of perplexed silence.</p>

<p>In tribute to the world&#8217;s most famous Ciddy fans, I spontaneously
changed the words of the final chorus:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;And, after all, United won f**k all&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>People looked perplexed. My mate (who was drinking bitter) said &#8216;This is
the best 40th I have ever been to.&#8217;</p>

<p>More songs were played. We drank more beer. We eventually went home.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Over Christmas, I was drying dishes, desperately trying to avoid
conversation or being dragged into a impromptu board game. From
upstairs, I heard a strange sound; the (discordant) opening chords to
&#8216;Smoke On The Water&#8217; by Deep Purple. Repeatedly.</p>

<p>Nothing too surprising there as my 12 year old nephew had been given an
electric guitar for Christmas.</p>

<p>I asked him who had taught him the three chords and he answered &#8216;Norman
Junior&#8217;. It transpired my son has been learning to play guitar with a
mate and they are progressing through &#8216;Monsters of Rock&#8217; classics.</p>

<p>Sensing a chance for some Father-Son bonding, a chance to obtain a
guitar and share a common interest, I asked Norman Junior III: &#8216;Would
you like a guitar for your birthday ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No thanks, Dad. I like messing around but I simply haven&#8217;t got the
motivation.&#8217;</p>

<p>I interpreted this as &#8216;Mum will force me to have lessons and I&#8217;d rather
play football.&#8217;</p>

<p>Another chance to play &#8216;She&#8217;s Lost Control&#8217; on YouTube evaporates.</p>
