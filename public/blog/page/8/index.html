  <div class="entry-content"><p>London, near England - Thursday 18 February 2010</p>

<p>British Prime Minister,
Gordon Brown, astounded the world today by announcing the total and
immediate withdrawal of all British troops from the current areas of
conflict in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>

<p>Speaking exclusively to Piers Morgan
on a prime-time chat show with tears in his eye, Brown explained:
&#8216;During the course of the Chilcott Inquiry (led by that England rugby
prop forward), a few facts became clear; Tony Blair misled Parliament
and lied to the British public.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;There were never any Weapons of Mass
Destruction in Iraq. We are fighting a war we can never win in
Afghanistan. The time has finally come to bring &#8216;our boys&#8217; home. We have
lost over 250 young men in Afghanistan. Enough is enough and there&#8217;s an
election imminent.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;A total of 12,500 troops will return home immediately from the
theatres of war in the middle-east and Afghanistan.  They will be
fully de-briefed and given clean underpants. Then they will return
home to their families for emotional reunions. Finally, the daily
funerals of brave bomb disposal experts in Wootton Bassett are over.
Seven TV crews and an opportunistic florist will also be recalled to
London today.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;This is not a day for trite soundbites but I can feel the hand of
history on my shoulder. This day shall be a Public Holiday to be
forever known as &#8216;Honourable Draw in Iraq and Afghanistan&#8217; Day (HDIA
Day).&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;On Monday, all the 12,500 members of the armed forces will all pack
up their kit, say a tearful good bye and fly out to The Falklands to
defend our newly found oil reserves from those pesky Argies.&#8217;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&#8216;Who&#8217;s there ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;It&#8217;s me - Jamie.&#8217;</p>

<p>Thinks to myself - I don&#8217;t know anyone called Jamie. My son isn&#8217;t
called Jamie. My daughter isn&#8217;t called &#8216;Janie&#8217;. Even though the wife
is visiting her parents and I have the house to myself, I don&#8217;t
suppose it&#8217;s that bizarre, twisted fantasy featuring Jamie Lee Curtis.</p>

<p>I reached for a 3 iron to defend myself and finally get myself in the
Daily Mail as a selfless vigilante, wrongly imprisoned for 7 years for
simply defending his own property. An Englishman&#8217;s home is his castle
and all that.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh - wait. Hang on Mister Brightside. Please put the golf club down,
please. I&#8217;ve just come round for an Xbox controller and Norman Junior
said you might be out so he gave me the keys to get in.&#8217;</p>

<p>And with that, I put the golf club down (Wilson Graphite Di9 Steel
4-SW) and said &#8216;Oh that&#8217;s all right then.&#8217;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of the reasons for the reduced blogging frequency, Kenneth, is
that I spend every waking hour devoting time to the thorny problem of
monetizing this humble blog. Previously, I experimented with
<a href="http://nbrightside.com/blog/2008/01/19/adsense-milestone">Adsense</a>
but sadly the revenue stream was insufficient to enable me to retire.</p>

<p>I am now pleased to announce the results of my research and
contemplations.</p>

<p>Do nothing. Absolutely nothing. Be patient. Wait. Don&#8217;t get
frustrated.  Just wait.</p>

<p>Sooner or later, you will receive an email promising you riches and
wealth beyond your wildest dreams.</p>

<p>In return for posting a link to a Web site, I am going to receive a
goodie bag containing the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>2 Packs of Love Hearts</li>
<li>1 Pack of Chewits</li>
<li>1 Pack of Black Jacks</li>
<li>1 Pack of Refreshers</li>
<li>1 Millions Tube</li>
<li>1 Pack of Giant Parma Violets</li>
<li>1 Chunky Drumstick Lolly</li>
<li>3 Packets of Fizz Wiz</li>
<li>1 Marshmallow Flump</li>
<li>1 Pack of White Mice or 1 Pack of White Chocolate Buttons</li>
<li>2 Snap Crackle Chewbars</li>
<li>2 Fruity Pops</li>
<li>1 Piece of Bubbaloo cola gum</li>
<li>2 Fruit Fizzers</li>
</ul>


<p>&#8216;The Retro Sweets Pile comes to you packaged in a clear bag.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8230;which is very important as if the goods were packaged in a brown
bag, people might think your were receiving sex aids through the post.</p>

<p>Prepare yourselves for a bunch of unobtrusive links to mindless,
desperate UK based SEO agencies appearing shortly. Prepare yourself
for a bunch of anecdotes about tooth decay and late onset diabetes.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Rich Manalang is taking a <a href="http://theappslab.com/2010/02/16/my-anti-social-experiment/">back
seat</a> and
suspending some but not all of his online activities which is an
interesting exercise I will follow as it unfolds. Or, rather I won&#8217;t,
because he won&#8217;t be blogging about it. I suppose I could always email
him at work.</p>

<p>I suspect Google Buzz was the final nail in his Web coffin.  It
certainly was for me. The privacy issues, the multiple, loud and
prolonged orgasms from the Technorati, the same old avatars gradually
showing up in my &#8216;Friends&#8217; list quickly followed by the immediate same
sense of &#8216;Emperors New Clothes&#8217; and the inevitable post coital
cigarette: &#8216;How was it for you, darling ?&#8217;</p>

<p>Rich&#8217;s decision to take a step back interests me as in the past, on at
least two occasions, I have gone slightly further and committed Web
2.0 suicide. This entailed spontaneously and maliciously terminating a
bunch of accounts on FriendFeed, Tumblr, LinkedIn and elsewhere. Of
course, it didn&#8217;t last and in due course I miraculously resurrected
myself - but after slightly longer than three days.</p>

<p>What I find slightly odd about Rich&#8217;s decision is that he will
preserve &#8216;IM and email&#8217; - I presume he means in order to work but
maybe he includes personal use too - but he then goes on to include
Google Reader as he finds &#8216;GR adds order to the chaos&#8217;. I agree
completely although I think the experiment would be much more
interesting if he ditched GR and idle Web browsing for that matter
too.</p>

<p>I suspect if I embarked on a similar exercise I would revert to
scanning my small set of favoured Web sites. I also suspect, and it
sounds slightly counter intuitive, that I would find lots more to blog
about.  Of course, Rich can&#8217;t blog more because blogging is also
suspended during this hiatus period. I also find this odd as he states
outputs (5%) are much more valuable, but greatly outnumbered by,
endless, mindless consumption (95%) so it would be interesting to see
whether his outputs increase as a result of his self-imposed exile.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Many years ago, in a parallel universe not far from here, I worked for a
small dot com Internet company.</p>

<p>One day, the boss walked in and proudly announced: &#8216;Right - I&#8217;ve
bought everyone three sessions at the London Float Centre&#8217;. I thanked
him but told him I wasn&#8217;t interested and he could give my three
sessions away to a more needy case but he was insistent and he was the
boss.</p>

<p>So, on a Thursday lunchtime, I found myself nervously walking down to
the mysteriously named &#8217;<a href="http://www.londonfloatcentre.com/">London Float
Centre</a>&#8217; located not in sunny San
Francisco but in grey, cold, dreary Clapham Common. As I nervously
walked into reception, my preconceptions and prejudices were instantly
reinforced when a young lady wearing a colourful, long dress with
braids in her hair greeted me.</p>

<p>I looked around at the arty artwork on the walls and nervously
mumbled: &#8216;Err, this is, err, my first time. How does this all work ?&#8217;
She replied: &#8216;You just go to your cubicle, get undressed and enter the
flotation chamber for 40 minutes. A quiet bell sounds to indicate the
end of your session.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Undressed&#8217; - did she just say &#8216;undressed&#8217; ? My reluctance and lack of
commitment to this ludicrous idea was being severely tested already. I
had packed my Hawaiian swimming trunks specially for the
occasion. No-one back at the office ever mentioned getting
&#8216;undressed&#8217;. The young lady must have sensed my unease or maybe she
saw my brightly coloured swim wear in my carrier bag I was holding
(like Mark. E. Smith but without the broken hip). &#8216;Of course, you
don&#8217;t have to get undressed. You can wear swimming trunks.  It&#8217;s
entirely up to you.&#8217;</p>

<p>I was about to depart for cubicle 3, wondering what the hell I was
doing here and cursing my boss when the young girl bamboozled me with
a surprise, trick question: &#8216;Do you want the music on or off ?&#8217; If I
hadn&#8217;t been so nervous, I would have answered &#8216;Yes please. I&#8217;ll have
&#8216;Bend Sinister&#8217; followed by &#8216;The Sky&#8217;s Gone Out&#8217; but instead I
hesitated, looked blankly and replied: &#8216;Music - how do you mean -
exactly ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Well - some people find the sensory experience is
heightened by music playing during the session. If you don&#8217;t like it,
just press the button to your left to turn it off.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Ah OK then - yeah I&#8217;ll have music. That will be nice. Thanks.&#8217; while
thinking inwardly to myself &#8216;&#8230;nice to ease the boredom of being
immersed in a salt water solution in a darkened room for 40 minutes.&#8217;</p>

<p>I made my way to cubicle 3 and assured myself that the dimensions of
the flotation tanks meant they were single user only and the cubicle
could be locked to ensure stray people could not wander in and
mistakenly stake a claim for immersion chamber No. 3. Finally,
reluctantly, I decided to embrace the full hippie, flower power, free
love experience by casting aside my shorts.  Plus the wife would be
pleased - they wouldn&#8217;t need washing.</p>

<p>Feeling like an idiot, I laid down in a small-ish,
rectangular tank of warm water. Gradually, the concentrated salt
solution managed to float my enormous bulk and I just laid there
floating - in silence - with the light on - staring at the cream
roof. Now what ?</p>

<p>I remembered the girl had told me to press another
button to turn the lights off which I did.</p>

<p>Now I was lying bollock
naked, floating around in a tank of luke warm water, staring up at
nothing - in pitch black. It was dark, completely dark. I waited 40
seconds for my eyes to adjust so I could make out the reassuring lines
of the walls and the ceiling but my eyes didn&#8217;t readjust. It was still
pitch black.</p>

<p>I was floating around aimlessly. I nearly had a heart
attack when my shoulder bumped the side wall. I thought someone,
possibly the not unattractive hippie girl with dreadlocks, had somehow
unlocked the door to cubicle 3 and silently crept in unnoticed to lie
alongside me.</p>

<p>I tried to calm myself down, to be open minded and
lighten up - for 30 seconds at least - and to actually try enjoy the
whole experience. I managed to master floating while remaining
perfectly still. I gradually felt calmer and actually started to enjoy
the silence. No longer was I looking for the solace of the walls or
the ceiling or worrying whether my wallet was safe.</p>

<p>Then, like a bolt from the blue, like a shot to the heart, from
nowhere , soft music started playing. Very quietly, very gently -
whale like music.  This was just like having a water birth at home -
except I was a middle aged man in a flotation chamber in Clapham
Common. Obviously, they didn&#8217;t have anything by The Fall or Bauhaus -
I must put that on the feedback form.</p>

<p>I laid back again and listened - nothing - apart from
the strangely reassuring and apt sound of dolphins talking to each
other. I strained my eyes - nothing. Again, I relaxed and forgot all
about my stupid, small, minuscule, trivial worries at work. I forgot
about everything. I even forgot about the prospect of falling asleep,
drowning in 8 inches of water and winning third place in the 2001
Darwin Awards.</p>

<p>I laid back, floating. My mind became strangely
blank. Completely blank.  It was glorious. A glorious nothing-ness. A
glorious emptiness. A glorious void. I just laid there; doing nothing,
thinking of nothing.</p>

<p>This state of mind continued for another 25
minutes. Not once did I think of the time. Not once did I think of
work. Not once did I think of United&#8217;s chances of lifting the
title. Not once did I think of online media recovery of an Oracle
layout: post
comments: true
database when some of the archived redo logs were in deep in secure
storage offsite and we only had a daily collection from Iron
Mountain. Not once did I think of the appraisals of the four people
reporting to me.</p>

<p>After a beautiful period of more nothing-ness, a
gentle noise told me the session was now over. I lay there for a
little longer and finally pressed the light switch.</p>

<p>The lights came on. I was back in the real world. I could see the
walls. I could see the ceiling. I could see how small the flotation
tank was. I could see a third button next to &#8216;Music&#8217; and &#8216;Lights&#8217;
called &#8216;Emergency Assistance&#8217;. Good job I hadn&#8217;t noticed that
earlier. The whale music CD abruptly ended as if killed by a blood
soaked harpoon.</p>

<p>I got dressed, checked the contents of my wallet and packed away my
dry swimming trunks for my summer holidays in Crete.</p>

<p>I walked back into reception: &#8216;Now - how was it ?&#8217; &#8216;Yeah - it was
great. Thanks.&#8217; &#8216;Oh good - we&#8217;ve had a lot of people from your
company. They all seem to enjoy their sessions here.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Would you like a cup of tea ?&#8217; I was about to reply &#8216;No - really I&#8217;ve
got to be getting ba-&#8217; but I caught myself just in time. &#8216;Yeah - that
would be great. Thanks.&#8217;</p>

<p>So I sat down with some blackcurrant, herbal tea chatting with the
receptionist about the science behind flotation chambers or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isolation_tank">isolation
tanks</a>.</p>

<p>Then I returned to the office. Now this is where is gets really weird.</p>

<p>I couldn&#8217;t concentrate. I felt like I was still floating up high,
looking down on everyone. I felt like I&#8217;d done some drugs. I couldn&#8217;t
type or read my email - well that&#8217;s not true - I could type letters
and read words but they didn&#8217;t seem to make sense. Nothing seemed
important. Nothing seemed to matter. As The Chameleons sang in &#8216;Second
Skin&#8217;, I felt like &#8216;I was floating on air&#8217;.</p>

<p>At 4 o&#8217;clock, I capitulated, politely made my excuses and decided to
go home early.</p>

<p>Years later, whenever I recount this story, my wife says: &#8216;Yeah - it
was weird. When he walked in, he looked like a complete zombie. I

  <div class="entry-content"><p><code>AND TO_NUMBER(TO_CHAR(appt_start_dt + 9/24, 'YYYYMMDDHH24MISS')) &lt;= TO_NUMBER(TO_CHAR((TO_DATE(:b1, 'DD/MM/YYYY HH24:MI:SS')), 'YYYYMMDDHH24MISS'))</code></p>

<p>Please can a clever Oracle person explain, in English, the precise
semantics of this WHERE clause snippet in the comments below.</p>

<p>I realise this construct and variants thereof have probably been
discussed ad infinitum on <a href="http://oracle-wtf.blogspot.com/">Oracle
WTF</a> but I just don&#8217;t get it.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know whether this SQL was written by a human being or a third
party ETL tool but it doesn&#8217;t matter. Currently, all ETL tools are
written by humans in any case.</p>

<p>Why do people struggle so much with date arithmetic ?</p>

<p>When I was a little boy, I used to say &#8216;Only 43
days to my birthday now, Dad&#8217;. Although I didn&#8217;t know it at the time I
could have written this as</p>

<p><code>sysdate + 43 = :my_birthday</code></p>

<p>I even understand that TRUNC(SYSDATE) is midnight - it just seems
fairly intuitive and logical to me.</p>

<p>My tiny brain can even understand
the concept of date subtraction - last Wednesday was two days ago and
Manchester City&#8217;s last trophy was almost 34 years ago.</p>

<p>I understand that a date is a date is a date. I realise that a date is
not an orange. I realise that a date is not a string and I only see
dates in SQL Developer because that was a design decision to perform
an implied conversion using the default date format and a useful user
friendly feature.</p>

<p>I understand that if I want to display the date and be assured of the
date format I need to convert it to a string using TO_CHAR with the
appropriate date format mask.</p>

<p>I understand that Unix systems (and the
next generation blogging platform, Habari) stores &#8216;dates&#8217; internally
as the number of seconds that have elapsed since the Unix epoch on 01
January 1970 00:00:00.</p>

<p>But look again at that code snippet. The author
is obviously familiar with the Oracle functions TO_CHAR and
TO_NUMBER but why in the name of God does he convert a date to a
string to a number and then compare the resulting outputs ?</p>

<p>What is the meaning of that generated &#8216;number&#8217; - 20100129143559 ?
&#8216;Twenty billion, one hundred thousand and and one hundred and twenty
nine million, one hundred and forty three thousand and five hundred
and fifty nine. Or something. Why is that a useful number ?</p>

<p>Why did he waste time and energy doing do all that typing ?  Is he
working on a top secret defence project that requires him to obfuscate
the code ?  Maybe he is paid by lines of code ?  The author is clearly
aware of some elements of date arithmetic in Oracle because he used &#8216;+
9/24&#8217; to add 9 hours to the appointment start date.</p>

<p>Maybe there was a useful index defined on APPT_START_DT that he
wanted to suppress for performance reasons.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not sure but I have an awful suspicion that the object associated
with the bind variable :B1 may already be declared as a DATE data type
but hey, let&#8217;s convert it to a date using TO_DATE - just to be sure,
to be sure.</p>

<p>Why didn&#8217;t he simply use</p>

<p><code>AND appt_start_dt + 9/24 &lt;= [TO_DATE] :B1</code></p>

<p>Why ?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This year&#8217;s Carling Cup Final between Aston Villa and Manchester United
will take place at Wembley on Sunday 28th February 2010.Curiously, this
date marks the exact 34th anniversary, to the very day, of Manchester
City&#8217;s last trophy.</p>

<p>After United defeated Millwall 3-0 in the 2004 FA Cup Final, all the
United players changed into shirts numbered &#8216;36&#8217; in a tribute to the
young player, Jimmy Davis, who had recently died in a car
accident.</p>

<p>Today I have written to the club to see whether United could do
something similar to mark the anniversary of Dennis Tueart&#8217;s
spectacular overhead kick that beat Newcastle in the 1976 League Cup
Final. My proposal is for United to sport shirts sporting a MASSIVE
&#8216;34&#8217; while Dennis Tueart could be the club mascot for the day, wearing
a pale blue and white retro scarf.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The Guardian has a decent
<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2010/jan/29/manchester-city-garry-cook-sheikh-mansour">summary</a>
of the various cock ups, gaffes and clangers dropped by Garry Cock.</p>

<p>The story claims Cook&#8217;s future at Manchester City is in doubt. This
would be a terrible shame but, knowing City, they have probably got
Peter Kenyon lined up as a ready replacement.</p>
