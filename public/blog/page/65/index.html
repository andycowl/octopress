  <div class="entry-content"><p>This lunchtime, after getting my phone past
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/07/06/just-do-what-you-are-told/">security</a>,
I visited the toilet at the same client&#8217;s offices. I was staggered to
see a sign above the
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/06/08/dont-talk-to-strangers/">urinal</a>
that had another red &#8216;No Entry&#8217; sign that said:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;STOP ! If you wish to use this space, please call Facilities
Management on Ext 3131. Reference TZ 864&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>So I dutifully stopped, zipped my flies up, walked to the sink and
called Ext 3131.</p>

<p>&#8216;Hello. I would like to use the space - reference TZ 864&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Hold on. I will just put you through&#8217;</p>

<p>[ A good job I wasn&#8217;t actually holding on ]</p>

<p>&#8216;Good afternoon. FM, Sheila speaking. How may I help you ?</p>

<p>&#8216;Hello. Norman Brightside here. I would like to use the space at TZ
684&#8217;.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh I see. Do you have a specific campaign in mind ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Err, well, no. What do you mean by a campaign ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Well - Recycle more printer cartridges. New deli range available in the
Atrium restaurant. Availability of Single Sign On for another 7 IT
systems. Discounted dry cleaning. Reinforce the corporate mission
statement. That sort of thing.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh I see. Well no. This is more of a personal matter.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh I see. Well is it to advertise a pub quiz night, five-a-side
tournament, sponsored fun run, apartment to let in Portugal, double
buggy for sale, tickets for a Chelsea game. That sort of thing&#8217;.</p>

<p>&#8216;Well no. Actually I was just hoping to use the, err, facilities here.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh I see. Where are you calling from ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;The mens toilets in Block 43.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;The mens toilets ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Err, yes. Just by the sink&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;And you just want to use the toilets ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh I see. So why did you call me ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Well the red, no-entry sign said &#8220;If you wish to use this space, call
FM on Ext 3131&#8221;&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh I see. Well is there a similar sign above the middle urinal ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;OK. Well use that one. Good-bye.&#8217;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This morning, I was waiting at reception in a client&#8217;s offices and was
filling in time by casually reading the various notices.</p>

<p>One, with a red &#8216;No Entry&#8217; sign, caught my eye:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;STOP ! If you are in possession of any camera equipment, please call
Group Security on Ext 4141&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>&#8216;Group Security. Alan speaking. How may I help you ?&#8217;</p>

<p>Good morning, Alan. Norman Brightside here. I just wanted to let you
know that I have a camera.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;OK (pause). Well, Norman, I don&#8217;t seem to have a completed C43
dispensation form from you.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I know. I haven&#8217;t filled in a C43 dispensation form.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Email it over and that will be fine&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I can&#8217;t email it over&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Why not ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I don&#8217;t actually work at these offices&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh I see. What office are you from ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I don&#8217;t actually work for ABC Corporation. I am just visiting today.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh I see. Well why are you bringing a camera onsite ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Well it&#8217;s not a camera exactly but my mobile phone can take pictures.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh I see. Well as you are not a permanent employee and as it isn&#8217;t a
real camera, that doesn&#8217;t matter so much so just sign in and that will
be fine.&#8217;</p>

<p>Strange. I would have thought visitors with concealed camera equipment
would have represented the biggest risk to corporate security.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Saturday 1 July</p>

<p>Get sent off. Lose to Portugal on penalties. After the game, Sven is
absolutely distraught. He is inconsolable, head in hands, weeping
quietly, alone in the corner. I feel guilty and go over to apologise.</p>

<p>&#8216;Sorry, boss. I have left myself down, let the team down, let the
country down, let the fans down and I have let you down.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I can&#8217;t believe it. 22 players, 6 assistant coaches and 15 FA officials
and no-one thought to get me a leaving present&#8217;</p>

<p>Sunday 2 July</p>

<p>Fly home. Thankfully, there are no hanging effigies of me (like Becks
got) but I notice that graffiti about me and &#8216;Grannies&#8217; is still in the
arrivals hall at Speke Airport.</p>

<p>Message on answerphone from Fergie. He wants to see me at Carrington
tomorrow morning. He doesn&#8217;t sound pleased.</p>

<p>Monday 3 July</p>

<p>Fergie gives me the full hairdryer treatment. He is mad about my sending
off and the tangle with Carvallho. He is worried that I may have damaged
my metatarsal on his testicles. Another scan.</p>

<p>Then he says he wants my thoughts on (another) Keano replacement. I say
that I would personally prefer Carrick as he would be better for my game
but Owen Hargreaves is stronger in the tackle and has incredible
stamina. Fergie interrupts and says &#8216;No. Not them. I&#8217;ve had a word with
Moyesy and we&#8217;re getting Phil Neville back on a free&#8217;.</p>

<p>Tuesday 4 July</p>

<p>Night out to watch Italy-Germany with Gary Nev and Giggsy. Call Steven
Gerrard who is too &#8216;tired&#8217;. Call Michael Owen to see if he fancies a
knees-up. Slams the phone down on me. Frankie Lamps is up for it and
drives 180 miles but loses his way right at the end.</p>

<p>Wednesday 5 July</p>

<p>Portugal lose to France. Text Ronny after the game to offer my
comiserations and clear the air. He is inconsolable. The presidential
elections at Real Madrid didn&#8217;t go as he hoped. He fears he will be back
at OT next season. Get Carvallho&#8217;s number and call him too to sympathise
&#8216;That was never a penalty mate&#8217;.</p>

<p>Thursday 6 July</p>

<p>Ruud calls to ask when pre-season training starts. He sounds a bit
strange. Maybe it&#8217;s because he had a disappointing World Cup too. I tell
him I&#8217;m worried that Ronny will be a ball-hog next season and never
release the ball or pass to us. Ruud makes a funny noise that scares me
a little. He tells me that he simply can&#8217;t wait, can&#8217;t wait, can&#8217;t wait
to lay eyes on Cristiano Ronaldo again.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Congratulations to Italy. They deserved to win as they scored two
sublime goals and played the game to the bitter end in the right spirit
and style.</p>

<p>Why - I haven&#8217;t seen so many Germans lying on the turf in crumpled,
disconsolate heaps since Barcelona in May 1999.</p>

<p>At times, the
<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/worldcup/2006/07/why_i_want_germany_to_win_the.html">BBC</a>
made me feel I was the only person in England not supporting our new
best friends, Germany.</p>

<p>Still, if I had just enjoyed a 6 weeks, all expenses paid holiday in
Germany, enjoying the hospitality watching all the World Cup games, I
would probably feel the same.</p>

<p>As for France versus Portugal, that&#8217;s a tricky one. I can&#8217;t decide who I
want to miss the decisive penalty more - Onnn-Reeee or Ronaldo.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Dear Peter Crouch</p>

<p>Listen to Gary
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/world_cup_2006/teams/england/5139040.stm">Neville</a>.
This time, there are no
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/world_cup_2006/teams/england/5145092.stm">excuses</a>.
No ifs, buts or
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/05/18/if-buts-and-maybes/">maybes</a>.
The hangovers have subsided. We have all taken those stupid flags off
our cars and are now looking forward to next season. Let&#8217;s face it -
England simply weren&#8217;t good enough.</p>

<p>As you had only played 60 minutes football and were the only recognised
striker on the pitch, I wondered why you didn&#8217;t step up for one of the
first four penalties ?</p>

<blockquote><p>Was it because you were so
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/world_cup_2006/teams/england/5145092.stm">tired</a>
?
Was it because you lacked confidence in your own ability ?</p>

<p>Was it because you were going to take the final penalty ?</p></blockquote>

<p>Then I remembered - it was probably because of memories of your last
ludicrous, pathetic, laughable attempt at a penalty against
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/world_cup_2006/teams/england/5040586.stm">Jamaica</a>
in a recent friendly.</p>

<p>Yours sincerely</p>

<p>Norman Brightside</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of the few England players who can hold his head up high after this
World Cup.</p>

<p>He silenced the doubters (myself included) with two immense performances
in midfield.</p>

<p>Oh and he converted a kick from 12 yards with just a goalkeeper to beat.
Very unusual and very un-English behaviour. It must be the Canadian
blood and the fact he plays his domestic football in Germany.</p>

have seen him 15 or 20 times this season.&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>And later, Eriksson just can&#8217;t help himself and, once again, shows his
true colours</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;The reason (for Eriksson leaving the job after the World Cup) was a

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Golly. It is very hot today. Thankfully, the UK
<a href="http://www.met-office.gov.uk/weather/europe/uk/heat_health.html">Government</a>
has told me the solution:</p>

<blockquote><p>Stay out of the sun. Keep your home as cool as possible. Shutting
windows during the day may help. Open them when it is cooler at night.
Keep drinking fluids.</p></blockquote>

<p>Now I would never have dreamt of thought of doing any of those things.
Superb advice. May I suggest a couple of additional top tips.</p>

<blockquote><p>Avoid alcohol. An ice-cold beer may seem very tempting but does tend
to dehydrate the body. Particularly if you have 7 pints of ice-cold
beer.
Avoid tea. The popular myth that &#8216;Tea is so refreshing on a hot day&#8217;
is just that - a myth. Tea contains caffeine and also tends to
dehydrate the body.</p>

<p>Remove extraneous clothing (within reason).</p>

<p>If the sight of your partner stark naked (see above) gets you all hot
and bothered, take a cold shower immediately. This will be far more
beneficial than becoming all amorous which will only result in both
parties getting even more hot and sweaty.</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Did my eyes deceive me or did Jamie Carragher come on as an England
substitute specifically to take a penalty in the shoot-out ?</p>

<p>Beckham&#8217;s &#8216;retirement&#8217; as England captain is interesting. I suspect he
will play on until he has 100 caps (currently has 94) and will then
&#8216;retire&#8217; completely from international football.</p>

<p>John Terry will be awarded the captaincy for two reasons. Firstly,
no-one would be able to understand Steven Gerrard in press conferences.
Secondly, Terry reacts in the precisely right way (openly weeping) to
defeat in penalty shoot-outs.</p>

<p>Steve Maclaren is already tainted by association (either he agreed with
Eriksson&#8217;s bizarre squad selection, tactics and substitutions or he
disagreed and was overruled) with this pathetic showing and the media
campaign to oust him <del>will start immediately</del> has already started.</p>

<p>If Gerrard and Lampard&#8217;s penalties were the result of hours of hard
practice on the training ground, then I would hate to see their efforts
without the benefit of that additional preparation.</p>

<p>Wayne Rooney is a excellent footballer but is an immature, young man
with a volatile temperament who is not blessed with much intelligence or
self restraint. It was almost inevitable that Rooney would lose his self
control at some point during the tournament, particularly when carrying
the hopes of the country on his shoulders and being forced to play the
lone striker for two games.</p>

<p>Cristiano Ronaldo&#8217;s intervention was also completely predictable. After
all, he is playing for Portugal in the quarter finals of the World Cup.
After Alex Ferguson backed Ronaldo in his row with Ruud van Nistlerooy,
it will be interesting to see the consequences of this incident at MUFC.</p>
