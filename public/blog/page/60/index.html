  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just returned from the annual torture of the seemingly simple task to
renew two parking permits. Yes folks, we have to pay for the privilege
of parking our cars in a nearby road, miles from our house.</p>

<p>To secure the parking permits, you need a wad of paperwork. In fact, you
probably need to produce fewer documents to adopt a Rumanian orphan. If
you have two vehicles registered to one person but used by two different
people, the documentation requirements and level of complexity increases
exponentially.</p>

<p>This year, I didn&#8217;t do too badly. I only had to make two separate trips
and enjoyed one lengthy, heated discussion. Despite this, my paperwork
was still deficient in two areas but the kind lady let me off with a
thinly veiled warning: &#8216;I&#8217;ll issue the second permit on this occasion
but next year, please ensure you bring <strong>everything</strong> with you.&#8217;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>Rugby players spend a lot of time physical training Compared to other
form of sports. I have read the <a href="http://www.creekrugby.com/">Rugby
laws</a> mentioned on this site. It&#8217;s a
gripping sport which targets the grip strength and the active
mindedness of a player. American football and rugby league are also
primarily collision sports, but their tackles tend to terminate much
more quickly. For professional rugby, players are often chosen on the
basis of their size and apparent strength and they develop the skill
and power over the passage of time. In modern rugby considerable
attention is given to fitness and aerobic conditioning as well as
basic weight training.</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was enjoying a stroll along The Embankment yesterday morning, dressed
in my Pearly King outfit, listening to Chas&#8217;n&#8217;Dave tunes on my iPod,
munching on cockles and mussels, when I noticed banners hanging from
each lamppost proudly proclaiming &#8216;We are
<a href="http://www.london.gov.uk/onelondon/index.jsp">Londoners</a>&#8217;.</p>

<p>The letter &#8216;D&#8217; was shrunk to accommodate the rest of the letters. Just
like a kid writing a Thank You letter to Auntie Joan and suddenly
realising he&#8217;s going to run out of space.</p>

<p>Inevitably, this brilliant campaign is the brainchild of Ken Livingstone
and sponsored by British Gas so if you pay the congestion charge or are
struggling to meet the recent increases in your gas bill, rest assured
your money is being spent very wisely.</p>

<p>Or, as Doug once memorably
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2005/12/20/the-killers-at-live-8/#comment-269">commented</a>:
&#8216;And your point is ?&#8217;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I heard an interesting interview on Radio 5 yesterday with UK blogger,
<a href="http://www.randomreality.org/aboutreynolds.htm">Tom Reynolds</a>. Tom
works for the London Ambulance Service and his
<a href="http://randomreality.blogware.com/blog">blog</a> is a mixture of amusing
anecdotes and real-life experiences.</p>

<p>I really like Tom&#8217;s blog title (&#8216;Random Acts of Reality&#8217;), his tagline
(&#8216;Trying to kill as few people as possible&#8217;), the dry sense of
<a href="http://randomreality.blogware.com/blog/_archives/2006/8/22/2253063.html">humour</a>
(summary of his recent
<a href="http://randomreality.blogware.com/blog/_archives/2006/8/17/2238180.html">holiday</a>)
and his general writing style.</p>

<p>Tom started his blog in 2003 which has just been made into a
<a href="http://randomreality.blogware.com/blog/DaBook">book</a> (&#8216;Blood Sweat and
Tea&#8217;) which is pretty remarkable.</p>

<p>Most definitely, one for the

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The first blog I ever saw was this
<a href="http://fleetie.livejournal.com/">one</a> (this
<a href="http://fleetie.livejournal.com/12067.html">entry</a> to be precise) and to
be honest, I just couldn&#8217;t see the point whatsoever.</p>

<p>Then I stumbled across Tom Kyte&#8217;s <a href="http://tkyte.blogspot.com/">blog</a>
which was relevant, interesting and sparked my interest in reading other
technical (Oracle related) blogs.</p>

<p>Just over a year ago, I
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2005/08/17/dot-bombs/">started</a> a blog
(on blogger.com). Little did I know it but WordPress.com was
<a href="http://lorelle.wordpress.com/2006/08/16/happy-birthday-wordpresscom/">launched</a>
the day before.</p>

<p>The creation of the blog was simply a quick experiment to play around
with the blogging software. Secondly I was interested to see how long it
would take to get a comment on the blog from a standing start. Then I
fully expected to lose interest completely.</p>

<p>The first comment &#8216;Great blog!&#8217; from a German reader duly arrived after
6 weeks. Looking back, this was probably comment spam so I was lucky
enough to count
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2005/11/04/tom-kyte-makes-mistake-shock/#comment-22">this</a>
as one of the first proper comments.</p>

<p>Initially, I thought I would produce more
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/02/20/introduction-to-etl-for-oracle/">technical</a>
content but, to be honest, the blog is done for fun in my spare time and
I think there are a wealth of more interesting, amusing subjects to
write about than Oracle and Siebel. In any case, a lot of very
intelligent, articulate people are already producing a raft of excellent
technical blogs.</p>

<p>So, a year on, and much to my surprise, the blog is still going strong.
I discovered that I actually enjoy writing. Maybe this is because I have
to produce fairly dry technical reports as part of my job.</p>

<p>Over the year, there were bursts of activity (11 consecutive days in
January) mainly from lonely European hotel rooms while on another
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/06/02/half-time-scoreboard/">occasion</a>,
inspiration dried up and my finger was poised over &#8216;Delete this blog&#8217;.</p>

<p>I have made some new contacts and met up with some old friends which was
also quite unexpected and welcome. Anyway, one thing&#8217;s for sure; if
there was no-one out there reading and occasionally commenting, I would
lose all interest in blogging in isolation so thanks for reading.</p>

<p>And finally, please forgive my self indulgence for a moment, but here is
a list of my favourite Top 10 posts from the last year:</p>

<ol>
<li>A narrow
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/03/21/a-narrow-escape/">escape</a>.</li>
</ol>


<p>Yes. That&#8217;s it. After one year, the only memorable post is one written
years before I even started this blog. I simply must try harder this
year.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The annual Brightside family vacation in Norway is now over and the
nominations for &#8216;Highlight of the Holiday&#8217; have just been received:</p>

<p>Norma - &#8216;The fantastic scenery, the awesome mountains and unspolit
beauty of the <a href="http://www.sognefjord.no/">fjords</a> coupled with the
feeling of absolute peace, solitude and tranquility.&#8217;</p>

<p>Norman - &#8216;The 3 hour
<a href="http://www.sognefjord.no/en-GB/PortalObject/659/default.aspx">hike</a> on
the <a href="http://www.jostedal.com/">Jostedalsbreen</a> glacier with spiked
boots, roped together in a group, taking in stunning views back down the
mountain, sticking an ice-axe into ice that is thousands of years old.&#8217;</p>

<p>Norman Junior III - &#8216;When I drove the motor boat at full speed, head on,
into the wake of the massive fishing trawler to ride the waves and Mum
got absolutely soaked, gathered her composure, turned around and then
got absolutely soaked (again).&#8217;</p>

<p>Norma Jean - &#8216;When Norman Junior came into the jetty too fast and
ignored Dad saying &#8216;That&#8217;s fine. Just stop the engine now. Turn the
engine off now. Kill the engine now. I SAID - KILL THE BLOODY ENG -
AARRGGHH&#8217; and Dad fell out of the boat.</p>
