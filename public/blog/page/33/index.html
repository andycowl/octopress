  <div class="entry-content"><p>My friends were disappointed, insulted and absolutely mortified at the
suggestion (from a
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/07/10/damned-with-faint-praise/#comment-83082">comment</a>
on this blog) that the Hook Norton Festival of Fine Ales was merely a</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;Boring, alcohol, induced haze&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>However, I simply loved the turn of phrase that captures the very
essence of Hook Norton in just four words. So much so, I had T-shirts
made up for this weekend&#8217;s
<a href="http://goathurling.blogspot.com/2007_07_01_archive.html#4748719187960821627#4748719187960821627">antics</a>.</p>

<p>New for 2007: The entire event will be live mob-blogged from start to
finish so don&#8217;t forget to tune in to this blog, Twitter, Pownce,
Facebook and BBC World Service for exciting, real-time updates.</p>

<p>PS. This will be news to wives, partners and mistresses who have always
been told that there is no mobile reception whatsoever in the beautiful,
unspolit Cotswold village which is the only reason their loved ones are
incommunicado for a blissful 48 hours.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I own up. It&#8217;s a fair cop. It is 27 years and 5 months since my last
confession. Since then, I have sinned, Holy Father. In fact, I have
committed an absolutely heinous crime. Please forgive me for I have
submitted multiple random guesses.</p>

<p>May the high priests (and priestesses) of the
<a href="http://www.battleagainstanyguess.com/baag/">BAAG</a> movement, please have
mercy on my wretched soul.</p>

<p>Recently, I have been guilty of supporting and even proposing a
multitude of &#8216;any guesses&#8217;, all of which were proposed as possible
solutions to solve a critical system problem on a production system:</p>

<ol>
<li>I failed to cough and splutter in an effort to stifle my laughter
when a manager suggested that 500 European users adopted shift
working to clear the backlog.</li>
<li>I didn&#8217;t shout down a ludicrous proposal to reboot the Siebel
Enterprise every 4 hours in order to maintain some level of service.</li>
<li>I wrote on a whiteboard that consideration should be given to
reinstating the previous version of the application even though this
in itself was risky, time-consuming and unlikely to address the root
cause.</li>
<li>I even proposed patching to Oracle 10.2.0.3 with no supporting
evidence whatsoever.</li>
<li>I shuffled nervously and blushed when the customer asked &#8216;Who do we
escalate to when you fail to fix this problem ?&#8217;</li>
<li>I watched in silence as the SAN man was stood against a wall and
pelted with questions as senior management all pointed fingers in
his direction.</li>
<li>I failed to stand up for righteousness and technical purity as
runaway, rogue sessions were maliciously and arbitrarily terminated
by an Oracle DBA.</li>
<li>I failed to suggest running a trivial SQL to determine index
fragmentation and stood by as 74 indexes were needlessly
reorganised.</li>
<li>I watched helplessly as a systems administrator claimed the problem
was &#8216;definitely in the underlying disk I/O subsystem&#8217; simply because
8,000 operations a second were being performed.</li>
<li>I failed to raise my eyes skywards and embark on a spontaneous two
hour training session with a DBA who claimed the &#8216;buffer cache hit
ratio was fine&#8217; and the problems only started once users were
allowed onto the system.</li>
</ol>


<p>My only defence is that all of the above &#8216;any guesses&#8217; created enough of
a diversionary smokescreen to buy me enough time, alone in a darkened
room, to analyze multiple Statspack reports, reproduce the majority of
the problems in SQL*Plus and then <strong>prove</strong> the behaviour was improved
when statistics on empty tables were dropped and two additional indexes
created.
tags:</p>

<pre><code>- uncategorised
</code></pre>

<p>This lucky &#8216;guess&#8217; miraculously restored performance and stability. So
you see, &#8216;any guess&#8217; is not always such a bad strategy, after all.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>OK. I couldn&#8217;t resist any longer. Scoble&#8217;s recent
<a href="http://scobleizer.com/2007/07/15/google-reader-facebook-yummy/">post</a>
about this killer Google Reader application forced me to sign up for yet
another pointless, short-lived, social network, Web 2.0 application -
<a href="http://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a>.</p>

<p>I was keen to preserve my &#8217;<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2005/08/23/firefox-and-thunderbird/">Johnny Come
Lately</a>&#8217;
status and was relieved to find, coincidentally, that
<a href="http://ocaoimh.ie/2007/07/16/oh-facebook-i-feel-so-dirty/">Donncha</a> had
signed up just ahead of me so I am now confirmed as the very last person
in the world to sign up for Facebook.</p>

<p>Scoble&#8217;s right. Mario Romero&#8217;s Google Reader
<a href="http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php?id=2354684299">application</a>
is blissfully simple and lets you browse friends&#8217; shared items and
aggregates the most popular shared items. Once it gets enough traction,
this application will indeed be &#8216;Digg for intelligent people&#8217; (and me).</p>

<p>Facebook is better than
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/03/03/linkedincom/">LinkedIn</a>
because it&#8217;s more human and it&#8217;s more fun. That senior partner at
Accenture with a tedious, dry 6 page CV can now be seen half-naked, pole
dancing in Bangkok, juggling firesticks, laughing and simultaneously
drinking a colourful cocktail through a novelty straw.</p>

<p>Facebook is aimed at a teenage audience and people who snigger at &#8216;Poke
Norman !&#8217; and I do have some difficulty with people writing
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/11/01/trick-or-treat/">graffiti</a>
on my &#8216;wall&#8217;.</p>

<p>For example, some cheeky Irish builder wrote this: &#8216;Urgently needs
re-pointing. Can do you a deal if you get your drive done at the same
time.&#8217;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The 80&#8217;s pop star - Prince - simultaneously delighted both his fans
and horrified the music industry with his shock inclusion of a
disposable CD with a leading (shurely shome mishtake) UK Sunday
newspaper.</p>

<p>Norman Brightside, an avid Daily Mail reader, was absolutely delighted
with the complimentary inclusion of &#8216;Planet Earth&#8217; with his
&pound;1.40 Mail on Sunday.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;I simply love &#8216;The Artiste Formerly Known As Prince&#8217;. Whenever I get
invited to a fancy dress or themed party, guess who I always go as ?
With this latest gift from The King (geddit?), we really are &#8216;going to
party like it is 1999&#8217;. I had heard a rumour that his latest CD would
cost &pound;8.99 and include a free copy of the Daily Mail but this
surpasses all my expectations. Let&#8217;s go crazy !&#8217;
&#8216;I am hosting a dinner party on December 18. Normally, I like to get
things underway with some David Gray, bread-sticks and dips followed
by Dire Straits and amusingly shaped carrots that resemble human
genitalia. However, this free copy of &#8216;Planet Earth&#8217; will make an
ideal ice-breaker and help initiate stimulating conversation for at
least 3 minutes.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;My wife isn&#8217;t quite so happy. She drove the &#8216;Little Red Corvette&#8217;
round all the newsagents and bought 153 copies of the Mail on Sunday
because she thought she was getting a free CD single featuring the
Duran Duran single of the same name. She is now suing Associated
Newspapers for compensation as she hurt her back lifting the pile of
newspapers into the recycling bin.&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>Zzzzzzzz.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last Thursday, I enjoyed an superbly entertaining taxi ride back from
LHR. Unusually, the taxi driver wasn&#8217;t waiting for me at the meeting
point. I called the taxi company and was told he was &#8216;3 minutes away&#8217;.
He was actually 10 minutes away but, to be fair, he was extremely
apologetic when he arrived.</p>

<p>The driver was a rather tall, imposing, Indian gentleman. Once in the
car, he immediately got into a protracted and increasingly heated
argument with the dispatcher about the address for his next drop-off.
The dispatcher insisted the location was &#8216;Surbiton&#8217; with no address. Not
unreasonably, the driver argued that he needed an exact address.</p>

<p>Finally, he turned to me and asked &#8216;Sir. May I ask you for your address
?&#8217; so I obliged. He then exploded at the dispatcher who eventually
conceded that my address was indeed correct, wasn&#8217;t actually &#8216;Surbiton&#8217;
and did include a road and house number.</p>

<p>Puzzled, I asked the driver why he simply didn&#8217;t ask him where I lived
when I got into the car. &#8216;Because you, Sir, are the customer and I
shouldn&#8217;t have to pester you just because I work with complete idiots.&#8217;</p>

<p>He then informed me that &#8216;while he wasn&#8217;t a racialist (sic), British
people were all incredibly stupid&#8217; and proceeded to expand this sweeping
generalisation with the startling fact that &#8216;last years Mensa study
reported that 68% of the world&#8217;s population was below average
intelligence.&#8217;</p>

<p>He then proceeded to regale me with a variety of hilarious anecdotes
from just two years in the minicab business.</p>

<p>One lady asked &#8216;Are you a cab ?&#8217; to which he replied &#8216;No, madam. I am
not a cab. I am a taxi driver so please do not leap onto my shoulders.&#8217;</p>

<p>Another teenager asked if she could smoke in the car. He politely
pointed to the &#8216;No Smoking&#8217; signs clearly displayed and said &#8216;No. I&#8217;m
sorry madam. That won&#8217;t be possible.&#8217; Undeterred, she then asked &#8216;How
much extra would it cost to smoke ?&#8217;. &#8216;Well, madam, if you pay me the
current market value of this car, I will get the bus home, you can drive
this car to your garage and you can smoke there all night long.&#8217;</p>

<p>On another balmy summer evening, a rich lady from Mayfair didn&#8217;t answer
the door or phone for 15 minutes. When she eventually deigned to open
the front door and announced &#8216;she had been sitting out in the back
garden with a glass of wine because it was sunny&#8217;, he replied &#8216;You&#8217;re
right. It is a lovely evening so I am ending my shift right now and
going to sit in my garden with a glass of wine&#8217;. He promptly left her
standing, speechless, on the doorstep.</p>

<p>Another customer threatened to call the office because the driver was
slightly late and he had a flight to catch. He said &#8216;Well it&#8217;s not my
fault that I&#8217;m late. Blame the idiots working at this company.&#8217; When the
customer said &#8216;That is outrageous. I am going to call your manager&#8217;, he
replied &#8216;Sir, you can call New Scotland Yard for all I care.&#8217;</p>

<p>But my favourite story involved another rich lady. It was late on
Saturday night, the roads were busy and the driver wasn&#8217;t familiar with
the area so he started to enter the destination address into the SatNav
system.</p>

<p>The well spoken lady said &#8216;Oh don&#8217;t bother with that. Just follow that
blue Mercedes&#8217;. My friend said &#8216;Certainly madam but I really would like
to key in the address as well if you don&#8217;t mind.&#8217; The lady said &#8216;Look.
I&#8217;ve already told you once. Just do what you&#8217;re told and follow the blue
Mercedes.&#8217;</p>

<p>The driver complied. 25 minutes later, the blue Mercedes pulled into a
driveway. The taxi driver pulled up at the kerb and stopped. He looked
into the back seat. His well dressed female passenger was asleep and
suddenly awoke. &#8216;Are we there ye - What are we doing here ? Where the
hell are we ?&#8217;.</p>

<p>The driver gestured to the car in the darkened driveway: &#8216;Madam, you
told me to follow the blue Mercedes.&#8217;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My son, Norman Junior III, plays competitive junior tennis. When I
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/10/25/celebrity-watch-2/">watch</a>
him play, I tend to stand at a distance and remain completely silent.
Outwardly at least. I always try to offer positive encouragement -
congratulations if he wins and commiserations after a defeat.</p>

<p>My son wins some matches and loses a handful more. However, he always
enjoys playing, he doesn&#8217;t scream and shout or thrash his racket into
the ground. He wins and loses with the same good grace which makes me
just as proud as his sporting prowess.</p>

<p>However, recently, he was given a real hiding by a lad of a similar age,
ranking and ability. When he came off, I said &#8216;Jesus. If you&#8217;re going to
play and serve like that, I think even I could take a set off you.&#8217; I
always call him &#8216;Jesus&#8217; when I am cross with him.</p>

<p>This lunchtime, work and school commitments finally allowed the great
Brightside veteran-junior invitational challenge to take place.</p>

<p>He thrashed me 6-0. I took him to a couple of deuces but only because he
made a couple of unforced errors and threw in a few double faults. When
Sue Barker interviewed me, in a sweaty and breathless state (me not Sue)
immediately afterwards, she made the preposterous claim that I only made
two outright winners during the whole 24 minutes.</p>

<p>When I asked my son for tips to improve my all-round game, he graciously
replied</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;You actually weren&#8217;t as bad I thought. You did get some serves in.&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>I may have lost but I can tell you, I really looked the part as I
strolled out onto court 14, immaculately

cream blazer with a cream holdall embossed in gold lettering with &#8216;NB&#8217;.</p>

<p>We then adjourned to Asda for an emergency purchase (toilet rolls) and I
cheered myself up with the purchase of
<a href="http://www.editorsofficial.com/">Editors</a> &#8217;<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/End-Has-Start-Editors/dp/B000PUAZDW/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/202-9208489-4082238?ie=UTF8&amp;s=music&amp;qid=1184074770&amp;sr=8-1">An End Has a
Start</a>&#8217;.
This CD has been on my wishlist for a whole but I have been poised on
tenterhooks, waiting for <a href="http://oracledoug.com/serendipity/">Doug
Burns</a> to divulge his innermost
thoughts on this indie band but, sorry, Doug, I simply can not bear the
suspense any longer.</p>

<p>I see <a href="http://www.interpolnyc.com/">Interpol&#8217;</a>s third album (&#8217;<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Our-Love-Admire-Interpol/dp/B000R7HQVW/ref=sr_1_1/202-9208489-4082238?ie=UTF8&amp;s=music&amp;qid=1184074858&amp;sr=1-1">Our Love
To
Admire</a>&#8217;)
is also out which has received negative reviews for being too similar to
the previous two with vivid echoes of Joy Division so that has also been
ordered.</p>
