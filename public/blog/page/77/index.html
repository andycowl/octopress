  <div class="entry-content"><p>Tom Kyte has some favourite
<a href="http://tkyte.blogspot.com/2006/03/some-inspirational-quotes.html">quotes</a>
so here are some of mine.</p>

<blockquote><p>Are you still doing what you did 5 years ago ? Yeah ? Well, don&#8217;t make
a career out of it ? (Mark. E. Smith)
All over Battersea, some hope and some despair (Morrissey)</p>

<p>As she parts her greying hair, voices on the stair (The Chameleons)</p>

<p>Every twenty minutes on the Appalachian Trail, Katz and I walked
further than the average American walks in a week (Bill Bryson)</p>

<p>Doing so will result in obstreperous behavior, usually devoid of any
amusement value. (Dynix/ptx manual on the dangers of mixing BSD and
ABI socket calls)</p>

<p>Is there really no beginning to your talents ? (Clive Anderson to
Jeffrey Archer)</p>

<p>Have you ever thought, just for one moment, that it might be you ?
(Alan Shearer to Glen Hoddle after Luxembourg game)</p></blockquote>

<p>And finally, for all you philosophers out there who managed to get this
far</p>

<blockquote><p>We may seem cold, or\
 We may even be\
 The most depressing people you&#8217;ve ever known\
 At heart, what&#8217;s left, we sadly know\
 That we are the last truly British people you&#8217;ll ever know
(Morrissey)</p></blockquote>

<p>Only joking. Sorry about that, philosophers. Here you go.</p>

<blockquote><p>Those who forget the past are condemned to relive it (George
Santayana)</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interweb">InterWeb</a>.</p>

<p>I think I first heard the term used, while working for a small Internet
company, by an Aussie. I can&#8217;t recall whether we were laughing at him or
he was laughing at us.</p>

<p>Anyway, I now use &#8216;InterWeb&#8217; at dinner parties, hotels and even in the
work environment. People used to stare quizzically but, sadly, no
longer. The term is now in common usage which somehow just makes it all
the more amusing.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just watched Arsenal beat Juventus 2-0 in the Champions League. I
don&#8217;t support Arsenal. I don&#8217;t really care whether they win or lose. I
only watched the game to kill two hours on a slow Tuesday evening in
Newcastle.</p>

<p>In March last year, however, I was also working away from home in
Gothenburg (near Sweden), watching a different game I passionately cared
about.</p>

<p>Here is the barstool correspondent&#8217;s verdict on Inter Milan 1 MUFC 0.</p>

<blockquote><p>Well this time last year (but a month later) I witnessed United&#8217;s
departure from the European Cup in a bar in Amsterdam and this year it
was Gothenborg&#8217;s turn.
The night started badly when we couldn&#8217;t get into the Sports bar as we
hadn&#8217;t booked a table. Good start.</p>

<p>Then my Swedish colleagues took me to an Irish bar which was showing
the Ice Hockey playoffs as Gothenborg were playing. Nice one.</p>

<p>So we sat down to eat and I was promised that the hockey would be over
soon and I could see the 2nd half. Great. Thanks for that. Food took
absolutely ages - it was only a burger for Pete&#8217;s sake and when it
came 40 mins later the chips were bloody cold. Thanks for that.</p>

<p>Eventually got to see 2nd half. We never got close to a shot on goal.
2 games and hardly a shot on target let alone any goals.</p>

<p>Their spawny goal looped over Tim Howard but still, at least we have
got rid of Roy Carroll. Yeah Ruud wasn&#8217;t fit, Giggs got a nose-bleed,
Rooney is too young, Scholes had two bad games, Keane is fine in
Premiership but too old for this level, Ronaldo&#8217;s a greedy,
showboating teenager but let&#8217;s see some PASSION and FIGHT. We needed
to go out and win tonight&#8217;s game !</p>

<p>And now we have to put up with Chelski and their oh so clever manager
in the media for 2 months !</p>

<p>PS. Did you happen to see Lyon&#8217;s result 10-2 versus Werder Bremen -
yes that is not a typo 10 goals against 2 goals. So Fergie&#8217;s squad
rotation against Fernabache doesn&#8217;t look quite so clever now, does it
?</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am fortunate to find myself staying in a pleasant enough hotel in
Newcastle upon Tyne. It is called the
&#8217;<a href="http://www.malmaison-newcastle.com/main.asp">Malmaison</a>&#8217; which is a
little pretentious for my liking (for an unpretentious city where people
wear T-shirts, white socks and mini-skirts in the depths of winter) but
a colleague is also staying here and it does provide a clean bed and a
shower which meets all of my simplistic requirements.</p>

<p>My confirmation email seems to confirm my suspicions with the following
gems:</p>

<blockquote><p>May we commend you on your choice of hotel. We&#8217;re sure you&#8217;ll find Mal
life like no other. Superior service. Choice cuisine. Dazzling drinks.</p></blockquote>

<p>Fantastic introduction. They are praising me (the customer) for my
superb choice in hotels.
They are already promising fantastic cuisine (even though I may choose
to eat elsewhere) and &#8216;dazzling&#8217; drinks (even though I will undoubtedly
choose to drink elsewhere). In any case, I wasn&#8217;t aware that Newcastle
Brown Ale could be described in that way due to legal constraints of the
Trade Descriptions Act.</p>

<blockquote><p>Perfect pampering. Memorable meetings. And of course sleep, with
plenty of zeds.</p></blockquote>

<p>As for &#8216;memorable meetings&#8217;, I have attended lots and lots of business
meetings. In fact, I am not sure that I can actually remember a single
one.</p>

<blockquote><p>Well, there we are. That should be all the bases covered.</p></blockquote>

<p>Promising use of management consultant speak.</p>

<blockquote><p>Please note that after 14th Feb, plastic is only fantastic with a
PIN!!!</p></blockquote>

<p>Excellent use of triple exclamation mark.</p>

<p>However, even my rusty &#8216;O&#8217; level French is still good enough to tell me
that the literal translation of &#8216;Malmaison&#8217; is actually &#8216;Bad House&#8217;
which seems an odd choice of name for a supposedly quality hotel.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The courteous, cheerful, courtesy bus driver from the car park to
Terminal 1 at London Heathrow Airport greeted me with: &#8216;Got your mobile
phone safe, Sir ?&#8217;. Unfortunately, I was a little taken aback by this
opening gambit and simply replied &#8216;Oh yes. I do. Thank you.&#8217;</p>

<p>Two minutes later, a better retort struck me &#8216;Yes. I left my flight
tickets back in the office. I forgot to print the address of the hotel
and my photographic means of identification is back at home but, yes,
please rest assured my toy phone with its irritating ring tone is safely
here in my pocket.&#8217;</p>

<p>It is dull, grey, wet and somewhat blustery in London and when I get to
the &#8216;Fast Bag Drop&#8217; desk, I am informed that my flight to Newcastle has
been cancelled and I am unable to drop my bags here at any speed.</p>

<p>Instead, I am redirected to the BA ticket sales desk to (hopefully) get
booked onto a later flight. When I reach the head of a very orderly,
polite, silent, British queue, I am cheerfully greeted with &#8216;Do you know
what is going on, Sir ?&#8217; which is a very deep, meaningful, thought
provoking and unexpected question.</p>

<p>Infuriatingly, I missed another gilt edged chance for a witty response
and just said &#8216;It is raining and windy so I heard a few flights have
been cancelled so I need to book onto a later flight to Newcastle&#8217;.</p>

<p>15 seconds later, I realised the optimal reply should have been &#8216;Nope. I
haven&#8217;t got the foggiest clue what is going on. The realisation is
slowly dawning on me that my manager, colleagues, friends (and my wife)
have indeed been correct all these years. I simply do not have a clue.
However, please, rest assured, that I do have my mobile phone safe and
sound.&#8217;</p>

<p>But before I could spit the words out, the BA gentleman told me exactly
what was going on. &#8216;Well, Sir. That is only partly correct. ATC (that is
- Air Traffic Control) have limited the number of inbound and outbound
flights to the airfield (I&#8217;m positive he called one of the busiest
airports in Europe an &#8216;airfield&#8217;) due to inclement weather conditions.
Consequently there are many cancellations and even the flights that are
getting away are still subject to lengthy delays&#8217;.</p>

<p>And, in a very British way, I thanked him for these glad tidings.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Student, indie, garage band who obviously love Blur and Half Man, Half
Biscuit (but sadly lacking the humour) and then, one day, after missing
a Physics lecture, the drummer comes in with a Macc Lads tape.</p>

<p>No wonder they gave CD&#8217;s away free at their early gigs. I should have
known better - always give a wide berth to any band who have ever been
described in glowing terms by NME.</p>

<p>I think the pronounced East Yorkshire accent (&#8216;Oop&#8217;) and Sheffield
references (&#8216;Hunters Bar&#8217;) finally did it for me.</p>

<p>A complete waste of money. Music to fall asleep (or drop out of second
year at Metropolitan University) to. Only slightly better (and less
embarassing) than James Blunt and David Gray.</p>
