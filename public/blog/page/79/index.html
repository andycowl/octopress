<p>Hard reset Palm Pilot. Download Thunderbird
<a href="http://kb.mozillazine.org/Talk:PalmSync_(Thunderbird">extension</a>) to
sync address book. Doesn&#8217;t work.</p>

<p>So now my Contacts are in Thunderbird (periodic manual export/import)
and I am using the Palm for Calendar and Tasks. If it&#8217;s good enough for
Dave Allen, then it&#8217;s good enough for me.</p>

<p>Next Action: Wait for Thunderbird/Sunbird to fully support Palm
synchronisation.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There is a terribly sad
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/london/4811626.stm">story</a>
in the UK about clinical trials that have gone (badly) wrong leaving six
people critically ill in hospital.</p>

<p>Radio 5 carried an interview with a person who has taken part in
previous trials. He was so full of praise for Parexel that I thought he
was a stooge.</p>

<p>That was, until, he uttered the unfortunate words</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;So, 1,000 GBP for one trial and 750 GBP for the second. For a
student, that is a lot of money and can actually be life-changing&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>Received an email from the WordPress Workflow Monitor Agent. Clicked the

want to consign the blog to Room 101.</p>

<p>[ Wonder why some <del>idiots</del> people end up posting on the Support Forum

<p>Watch in horror as browser fleetingly accesses &#8216;andyc.wordpress.com&#8217;
instead and brings me to this dashboard. So, on second thoughts, I think
I will leave things just as they are.</p>

briefly appearing in Dave Sifry&#8217;s Link Cosmos (a proud moment indeed)
and a
<a href="http://whiteside.wordpress.com/2006/03/14/starting-from-zero/">citation</a>
from this very odd <a href="http://whiteside.wordpress.com/">gentleman</a>, this

<p>However, the grim realisation is slowly dawning that there is more
chance of MUFC catching Chelsea than my humble blog overtaking Stowe
Boyd. Consequently, I have reluctantly lowered my sights and now have
<a href="http://oracledoug.com/serendipity/">Doug Burns</a> (bathing in the
afterglow of the HotSos effect) on my radar.</p>

the quarter finals of the FA Cup.</p>

<p>The best football banner in the world was very simple and understated -
just two large digits at the Stretford End. The number was incremented
on or around 28th February each year.</p>

<p>The banner is no longer at Old Trafford (following the Glazer takeover)
but can still be seen at
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_United_of_Manchester">FCUM</a> matches
apparently. Easier to get tickets too.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&#8230;not to bury them.</p>

<p>I have been unable to administer this blog for a couple of days.
However, thanks to the unstinting efforts of <a href="http://boren.nu/">Ryan</a>
and <a href="http://blogs.linux.ie/xeer/index.php">Donncha</a>, I am pleased to say
the problem is now resolved.</p>

<p>I was trapped inside a recursive, infinite, endless loop hell which
severely tested my sense of
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/03/12/wordpress-humour/">humour</a>
after 28 minutes. In fact, I was positively irritated, frustrated and
tending towards &#8216;annoyed&#8217;.</p>

<p>I was aware there were a few issues at WordPress following recent
changes. Initially, I assumed my problems were related and just waited.
However, then I saw people merrily posting away on their WordPress blogs
(and not just Scobleizer who has a custom template and a dedicated
server farm).</p>

<p>I tried a few things myself (cleared cookies, different browsers,
different computers) but all to no avail. I started a self-help group
for affected bloggers. I scanned digg, reddit, tailrank memorandum,
Google (and the BBC World Service) in vain for mention of this
catastrophe in the blogosphere.</p>

<p>I posted a few rapid fire entries on my new shiny blog (the soon to be,
sadly, departed
&#8217;<a href="http://whiteside.wordpress.com/">whiteside.wordpress.com</a>&#8217;). I thought
up a fantastic new tag line - &#8216;interminable bytestream&#8217;. I used the
<a href="http://performancing.com/firefox">Performancing for Firefox</a> blog
editor which was excellent and was also impressed by the recently
released <a href="http://performancing.com/metrics/start">Metrics</a>.</p>

<p>However, I persisted reading and posting to the WordPress support forum
and eventually got into an email dialog with Ryan. His email actually
&#8216;thanked me for my report&#8217; (as if I was somehow doing him a favour),
apologised for &#8216;breaking my blog&#8217; (as though I am a paying customer),
described the progress so far (interesting) and assured me they were
&#8216;trying to put it right&#8217; (reassuring).</p>

<p>And within a short period, they did.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am a fan of WordPress. I like their software. I like their
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/03/12/wordpress-humour/">humour</a>.</p>

<p>I pay absolutely nothing for the service so I really can&#8217;t complain when
it breaks.</p>

<p>However, today is the second day I can&#8217;t access my blog on WordPress.</p>

<p>Nothing on <a href="http://technorati.com/">Technorati</a>. Nothing on
<a href="http://digg.com/">Digg</a>. Nothing on
<a href="http://tech.memeorandum.com/">tech.memeorandum</a>. Nothing on
<a href="http://tailrank.com/">TailRank</a>. Nothing from those Wordpress &#8216;A&#8217;
listers, <a href="http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/">Scoble</a> and
<a href="http://scripting.wordpress.com/">Winer</a>.</p>

<p>In fact, as I could see other people sporadically
<a href="http://lorelle.wordpress.com/2006/03/13/probloggers-blogging-for-beginners-series/">blogging</a>
on WordPress, my paranoia took hold and I started to wonder whether I
was the only person in the entire blogosphere affected by this problem.</p>

<p>Then, finally, I read the following
<a href="http://wordpress.com/forums/topic.php?id=1029&amp;replies=6">posting</a> from
<a href="http://photomatt.net/">Matt Mullenweg</a> in the WordPress Support forum</p>

<blockquote><p>We&#8217;re shifting some things to address the problem, and there is new
hardware and such coming online as soon as we can get it.</p></blockquote>

<p>So, that&#8217;s fine. An update from someone in the know although the phrase
&#8216;new hardware&#8230;when we can get it&#8217; makes me slightly uncomfortable and
reaching for my Blogger details and the non-existent WordPress &#8216;export&#8217;
button.</p>

<p>Anyway, I am sure that when a spate of other high profile Web 2.0
companies
(<a href="http://blog.del.icio.us/blog/2005/12/index.html">del.icio.us</a>,
<a href="http://buzz.blogger.com/2005/12/blogspot-is-happy-again.html">Blogger</a>,
<a href="http://www.sixapart.com/typepad/news/2005/12/recap_of_friday_1.html">TypePad</a>)
had problems in December last year, the news was plastered all over
Technorati and elsewhere.</p>

<p>So, are WordPress so fantastic and so powerful, that they are actually
beyond reproach ?</p>

two reasons:</p>

<li>Apart from creating a load of splogs or bribing people, I have

<p>I may well now turn my attention to <a href="http://www.pubsub.com/">PubSub</a>
where my ranking is a much more satisfying 66,425 (InLinks 0, OutLinks
