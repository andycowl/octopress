  <div class="entry-content"><p>Shamefully, I don&#8217;t read many
<a href="http://nbrightside.com/blog/2006/11/29/testing-debut-at-book-club">books</a>
so an eBook reader has never been high on my list of priorities as it
would probably become a moderately expensive white elephant and yet
another gadget to carry around.</p>

<p>However, Amazon&#8217;s high profile marketing campaign for the
<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Kindle-Wireless-Reader-Wifi-Graphite/dp/B002Y27P46/ref=amb_link_157708327_3?pf_rd_m=A3P5ROKL5A1OLE&amp;pf_rd_s=center-1&amp;pf_rd_r=1HW1QM99QH67J6F2RA47&amp;pf_rd_t=101&amp;pf_rd_p=223297127&amp;pf_rd_i=468294)">Kindle</a> eBook reader sparked my interest sufficiently to
download the free Kindle Reader <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html/ref=red_lnd_shrt_url?ie=UTF8&amp;docId=165849822">application</a> for Android to
sample the experience of reading an eBook on a mobile device.</p>

<p>In addition, I&#8217;ve just purchased a higher capacity (16GB) SD card for
the Android phone which means it could replace my iPod Touch as I can
now store all my music on the Android phone and start to consolidate
two of my mobile devices. If the Android Kindle Reader application is
usable, could the <a href="http://www.htc.com/www/product/legend/overview.html">HTC Legend</a> also fulfill the role of an
eBook Reader ?</p>

<p>I downloaded Tom Reynold&#8217;s &#8217;<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Blood-Sweat-Tea-Adventures-Inner-city/dp/1905548230/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1313594801&amp;sr=8-1">Blood Sweat and Tea</a>&#8217; mainly because
it was free and I had previously <a href="http://nbrightside.com/blog/2006/08/22/in-praise-of-tom-reynolds">enjoyed</a> Reynolds&#8217; blog about
his experiences as a paramedic working for the London Ambulance
Service.</p>

<p>I have had (courtesy of my employer) an HTC Legend for 3 months and I
have been staggered at the razor sharp quality and resilence of the
screen. Even without a screen protector, the display is pristine and
crystal clear despite moderate use during that period.</p>

<p>Reading text on the Android is pretty easy on the eye. The font is large
enough and clear enough for me to read easily and the contrast is
excellent. Also, I am only reading for short periods (up to half an hour
on my commute into the city) and the fact that &#8216;Blood Sweat and Tea&#8217; is
merely a compilation of blog posts means each story is a very short and
manageable chunk. This light, casual reading may be slightly easier on
the eyes than ploughing through &#8216;War and Peace&#8217; for prolonged periods.</p>

<p>The larger screen on the Kindle does look great and I have heard great
things about the screen technology but there&#8217;s one reason I would
currently not even contemplate buying a Kindle.</p>

<p>I selected a popular book being advertised for Christmas - &#8216;The Fry
Chronicles&#8217; by Stephen Fry. The paper edition of this book costs
<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Fry-Chronicles-Stephen/dp/0718154835/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1292686033&amp;sr=1-1">&pound;8.20</a> at Amazon (UK). To my amazement, the
Kindle version of the same book costs a staggering <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Fry-Chronicles/dp/B0042JTA56/ref=tmm_kin_title_0?ie=UTF8&amp;m=A3TVV12T0I6NSM&amp;qid=1292686033&amp;sr=1-1">&pound;12.99</a>.</p>

<p>Yes - you read that correctly. &pound;8.20 for the hardback book and
&pound;12.99 for the electronic version of the same book for the
Kindle.</p>

<p>Now let&#8217;s think about this. For the paper edition, the publisher has
to print a book on 448 pages of paper. The book also has to be bound
and this is the hardback edition. For the Kindle edition, the
publisher has to, err, well, create an electronic copy of the book.</p>

<p>How in God&#8217;s name can the publisher/Amazon justify charging an
additional, extortionate, staggering premium of 58% for the Kindle
edition ?</p>

<p>Now this may be a one-off rare example and it&#8217;s true that some books
are cheaper on Kindle than for the paper book. For example, the
popular &#8216;Girl with the Dragon Tattoo&#8217; is slightly cheaper on Kindle
(&pound;2.68) versus &pound;3.89 for the paperback edition. Now I
don&#8217;t have the time or inclination to exhaustively check the
comparative prices of paper versus Kindle editions for the remainder
of the best seller lists and it is true that some classic texts
(e.g. Treasure Island, Sherlock Holmes) are freely available for
eBooks.</p>

<p>However, in a sense that&#8217;s irrelevant - the Kindle edition should
always, always be cheaper than the paper book - guaranteed, 100%,
every time for every book regardless. Until that is the case, I won&#8217;t
be buying a Kindle or any other eBook reader.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Frankly I think the pair deserve each other but some excellent
<a href="http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/football/early-doors/article/303175/">quotes</a> from Tevez&#8217;s agent, Kia Joorabchian, on Garry Cock.</p>

<blockquote><p>‘Garry Cock thinks he&#8217;s bigger than Carlos Tevez.&#8217;</p>

<p>‘Garry Cock has an inflated opinion of himself. I brought him in from
Nike after he begged me to get him a job in football.&#8217;</p>

<p>‘I got him a job which paid him more than four times what he was
earning at Nike and he didn&#8217;t complain about me then but it&#8217;s all gone
to his head.&#8217;</p>

<p>‘Maybe because he played no part in bringing Carlos to the club that&#8217;s
a problem for him. Maybe he&#8217;s upset because he didn&#8217;t have any input.&#8217;</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last week, I went to see The National at Brixton Academy. Twice. Both
shows were great (Monday just shaded it) and the band resurrected a
rarely played classic ‘Lit Up&#8217; (one of my all-time favourite National
songs) on both nights which was an unexpected and brilliant bonus.</p>

<p>I’d been eagerly waiting for these dates to come around since I
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2010/05/07/the-national-royal-albert-hall">saw</a>
the band on election night back in May at the Royal Albert Hall.</p>

<p>This beautiful photo taken by [Alison Philcock][] brilliantly captures
the mood and sense of expectation shortly before the band took the
stage.</p>

<p>My family were genuinely perplexed as to why a grown man was going to
see the same band play twice within three days and were unimpressed with
my reply of ‘Well, I couldn&#8217;t get tickets for Tuesday&#8217;.</p>

<p>I also won a &pound;10 bet with Norma who bizarrely insisted that the band
would play the same set in precisely the same order. On Wednesday, two
of my favourite songs ‘All The Wine&#8217; and ‘About Today&#8217; replaced
‘Runaway&#8217; and ‘Little Faith&#8217;.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>At the weekend, I purchased a new printer after replacing the ink
cartridges failed to reinstate the ability to print in black on my Canon
IP4000.</p>

<p>Previously, I&#8217;d researched which printers had decent Linux support and
decided on an <a href="http://h10010.www1.hp.com/wwpc/uk/en/ho/WF05a/18972-18972-238444-410635-410635-4066450.html?lang=en&amp;jumpid=oc_R1002_UKENC-001_HP%20Deskjet%203050%20All-in-One%20Printer%20-%20J610a&amp;cc=uk">HP Deskjet 3050</a>. This is a wireless printer so I hoped
that the Windows PC&#8217;s in the house would be able to print directly and
the management of the printer (inkjet levels) would be easier. My
current Canon IP4000 has served me well but is pretty old and I was
surprised to find I could pick up an HP wireless printer for &pound;34.</p>

<p>I checked the price on Amazon to find the price has risen to &pound;38.99 in
the intervening two weeks - not just at Amazon but at all online
retailers I normally use. No problem - still excellent value. As Norma
is patiently waiting to submit a couple of essays for her course, I
decided to venture out to try to buy a printer as delivery times from
Amazon could be delayed given the recent cold spell.</p>

<p>I walked into Comet - the HP Deskjet 3050 was on the shelf listed at
the price I&#8217;d originally seen - &pound;34.00. I darted next door to a
cavernous PC World which is the size of a aircraft hanger and a gadget
heaven. They also had the printer but now at the higher price of
&pound;38.99.</p>

<p>I went back to Comet, picked up the last remaining Deskjet box and
walked up to the till. The girl swiped the barcode and said (much as I
expected) - &#8216;That will be &pound;38.99, Sir&#8217;. &#8216;Oh I think that&#8217;s a
mistake - it&#8217;s listed as &pound;34.00 on the display&#8217;. &#8216;No, sorry,
Sir. It&#8217;s coming up on the computer as &pound;38.99&#8217;. &#8216;Sorry but the
price on the display is &pound;34.00 and you have to charge me that
price for the printer. It’s the law&#8217;.</p>

<p>She interrupted me ‘Well I will have to see this for myself. Can you
show me ?&#8217; So we both ambled over to the display area of various
printers. The shop assistant wasn&#8217;t best pleased and she muttered ‘Are
you absolutely sure it&#8217;s the same printer, the same make and model ?&#8217;</p>

<p>We arrived at the display item for the HP DeskJet 3050 printer where the
price was displayed as clear as day, in black and white as &pound;34.00. She
turned back towards the till without a word so I duly followed, feeling
slightly guilty.</p>

<p>&#8216;Right then, Sir&#8217;. And she entered a manual override for the price and
entered &pound;34.99. That will be ‘&pound;34.99 please&#8217;. ‘But the
price is &pound;34 dead, &pound;34 exactly&#8217;. &#8216;Was it ?&#8217; By now my
patience and my good humour at finding the desired printer in stock
and saving &pound;5 was being tempered by this girl&#8217;s surly and
unhelpful attitude.</p>

<p>‘Listen. We&#8217;ve just walked over to check the price. We did that because
I know what the price is but you don&#8217;t. Didn&#8217;t you even look at the
price ? What was the point of going over if you&#8217;re can&#8217;t be bothered
looking at the price?&#8217;</p>

<p>‘So you&#8217;re really going to argue with me over 99p are you ? I&#8217;ve already
keyed it now.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes - because the price is &pound;34.&#8217; She emitted a long sigh under her
breath and she entered the correct price and I proferred my credit card.</p>

<p>And now in a voice scarily reminiscent of Catherine Tate as the TGI
waitress; ‘Would you be wanting extended insurance cover with that, at
all, Sir ?&#8217;. &#8216;Oh no - thanks - just the printer, thanks.&#8217; &#8216;Insurance
cover is available for just &pound;24.99 for 3 years and &pound;34.99
for a full, comprehensive 5 years peace of mind&#8217;.</p>

<p>&#8216;I’m not really likely to insure something that cost me &pound;34 for
&pound;35. If it blows up after 1 year and 1 day, I’d just buy another
printer that is likely to be better, faster and probably cheaper.&#8217;</p>

<p>‘Well that&#8217;s entirely up to you, Sir but these printers can be quite
unreliable.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No really. Just the printer thanks&#8217;. &#8216;Right - so that’ll be &pound;34.00 for
the printer then.&#8217;</p>

<p>I went to nudge the printer box towards me in a precursor to leaving
this godforsaken store and erasing this girl&#8217;s morose, stupid, miserable
face from my memory bank. For ever.</p>

<p>‘Can I interest you in more ink cartridges, Sir ? Special offer in
December on all inkjets - buy one set of ink and get another one at half
price.&#8217;</p>

<p>‘No thanks. I normally get my cartridges off the Internet.&#8217;</p>

<p>‘OK, Sir. That&#8217;s entirely up to you but I must tell you that printers
only come with a &#8216;starter pack&#8217; which only print 50 pages or so so you
might run out very quickly.&#8217;</p>

<p>I smelled bullshit here but I wouldn&#8217;t put it past the printer
companies in an effort to recoup their loss on the actual device to
ship with smaller, low capacity cartridges. Worse, the spectre of
Norma printing out several lengthy papers and articles and the ink
running out just as she printed of the final revision of her essay for
submission was hovering overhead like a hungry vulture.</p>

<p>&#8216;No thanks. No insurance. No additional ink. Just the printer. Thanks.&#8217;</p>

<p>I got home, quickly installed and configured the printer and
discovered HP provide two standard cartridges (black and the 3 colour
mix). No starter pack.</p>

<p>I quickly checked wireless printing from three Windows computers (XP,
Vista and Windows 7) and downloaded the latest version HP native Linux
software
(<a href='http://hplipopensource.com/hplip-web/index.html'>HPLIP</a>)
to configure and manage the printer which was conveniently available
in the Fedora 14 repositories.</p>

<p>Finally, I ordered two spare cartridges from Amazon for &pound;20
compared to &pound;24 at Comet.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In my job as a roving IT consultant, I have given a number of technical
presentations about Siebel. During that time, I have learned that I am
much more comfortable presenting material and content that I have
created myself. I have also presented slide-decks used by technical
pre-sales. This has occasionally led to detailed questions arising about
a very innocuous looking bullet point which I was unable to effectively
answer; not a comfortable situation.</p>

<p>Occasionally, I have delivered technical workshops about a very specific
area of the Siebel product set that was tailored to a customer
requirement for a module that is not covered by a formal course offered
by Oracle Education. I have thoroughly enjoyed this type of work as I
find it stimulating and very rewarding. I also felt the customer also
found these workshops useful and valuable.</p>

<p>Last week, I gave a 2 day workshop about EIM (Oracle&#8217;s ETL tool to bulk
load data into a Siebel OLTP database) and I actually created some
practical lab exercises to give the attendees some hands-on experience
of failing to load data using EIM. I&#8217;m being serious here - I firmly
believe it is very important to be exposed to the different classes of
errors and idiotic mistakes when trying to achieve a seemingly
straightforward task of populating a single customer record.</p>

<p>I visited the client&#8217;s offices the day before to check the logistics and
the Siebel environment provided for the workshop. I also took the
sensible precaution of completing the various exercises myself. To my
horror, I discovered at 3pm on the day prior to the workshop that EIM
wasn&#8217;t actually functional in the customer test environment. Thankfully,
I discovered this was due to a missing Service Pack for the Microsoft
SQL Server database which resolved the problem and saved me from a very
embarrassing situation.</p>

<p>Whenever I&#8217;ve attended training courses, I&#8217;ve always felt slightly
uncomfortable whenever the instructor went walkabout and hovered over my
shoulder as I struggled with the syntax of ‘ALTER TABLE&#8217;. Consequently,
when I set the attendees loose on the first exercise, I tried to take a
back seat and only help if someone requested assistance.</p>

<p>I am not a teacher - in fact, I am a lousy teacher as I have precious
little patience - and I am not a trained instructor. However, I was
quite curious to see how different people attacked the problem. One chap
was feverishly reading the manuals, typing at speed, running the tests,
examining log files, iterating in an effort to win the race. One of his
colleagues had a rather more considered approach and I noticed he chose
to take time to assist his neghbour who wasn&#8217;t as far forward. Another
attendee was very methodical and thorough; he essentially created a full
source-target mapping in Excel before he did anything else and was
completely unfazed by the progress of others around him. Another
gentleman reminded me of myself - he was bludgeoning forward at
breakneck speed, making misakes (syntax errors), immediately fixing them
and iterating rapidly.</p>

<p>I approached one gentleman quietly beavering away in the corner who had
actually completed the orignal exercise but hadn&#8217;t shouted ‘Eureka&#8217; or
called me over to praise his efforts. Instead, he was now creating a
data set of 10,000 customer records to see what throughput he could get
compared with the performance of the existing custom COM based data
loading tool.</p>

<p>All in all, a very enlightening exercise. Psychologists would probably
classify each type of individual with a special name
(‘Starter-Finisher&#8217;).</p>

Redirect module and the Disqus crawler will remedy this given time.</p>

<p>Most of the modules I require are available for Drupal 7 apart from
FeedBurner so I have just re-pointed the feed for now.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s see if this appears on the other side.</p>

<p>I will probably convert to using MarkDown markup in due course too.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was recently in a pub when a lady looked expectantly at me and said
‘Fancy a whip for this ?&#8217; I looked a little taken aback and hesitated
until she helpfully clarified ‘A kitty. For the drinks. Shall we have a
whip round and I&#8217;ll then buy some drinks&#8217;. In a very polite British way,
I proffered a ten pound note and said ‘Oh that will be great. Thanks for
sorting that out. A pint of London Pride for me, please&#8217;.</p>

<p>Whereas what I really wanted to say was. ‘We are two couples having a
quick Saturday night drink after watching some amateur dramatics
featuring some friends. It&#8217;s five past ten so we&#8217;ll probably have two
drinks. Why on earth should we contribute to a kitty ? You buy us a
drink and I promise that we will reciprocate.&#8217;</p>

<p>There are many different problems with these whiprounds and kitties:</p>

<ul>
<li>Someone has to manage the money.</li>
<li>Someone, normally the fastest drinker, always ends up thirsty as,
like a training course, the pace is governed by the speed of the
slowest person present. If girls are involved, you can actually die
of thirst and lose your kitty contribution.</li>
<li>People always think things are cheaper than they actually are so are
sceptical when the demand comes round to top up the kitty.</li>
<li>As the night progresses, people become less inhibited and contribute
massive amounts ‘Here&#8217;s &pound;50. That should sort it for a while.&#8217;</li>
<li>At the end, the kitty has to be sub-divided and the proceeds
returned to all contributors. This is a variant on the ‘splitting
the bill&#8217; syndrome at a restaurant - only more complicated and time
consuming. Forget the last train home. You&#8217;ve missed it. You&#8217;re
getting an expensive taxi. Still, at least the drinks were equitably
divided.</li>
<li>I once had the misfortune to be appointed ‘Kitty Treasurer&#8217;. This
was a complete nightmare because people expect you to continually go
to the bar. Time after time because ‘you&#8217;ve got the whip&#8217;. I never
spoke to anyone but the bar staff all night.</li>
</ul>


<p>So please don&#8217;t invite me into your ‘kitty&#8217; or contribute to your stupid
‘whip&#8217;. This is the correct and proper way to ensure a night of trouble
free, enjoyable drinking:</p>

<ul>
<li>Get in a round with mates who drink at vaguely your rate. With
blokes this doesn&#8217;t matter as slowcoaches simply accrue 5 full,
untouched pints while the rounds continue to be brought over to the
table regardless.</li>
<li>Ensure the rounds are ‘equalised&#8217; by the end of the night. This
means that everyone in the round buys the same number of pints. I
can&#8217;t emphasis the importance of this enough.</li>
<li>Choose the size of the round appropriately. If you&#8217;re in a group of
4, you need to prepare to sup 4,8, 12 or even 16 pints.</li>
<li>Large groups can lead to livers the size and colour of George
Best&#8217;s. Consider splitting large groups into 3&#8217;s or 4&#8217;s.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t skew the financial calculations by having a crafty ‘Southern
Comfort&#8217; on the penultimate round because ‘I&#8217;m a little full of
beer&#8217;. Just drink pints. You&#8217;re a man. That&#8217;s why you&#8217;re in a pub
not a wine bar.</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last week saw the first anniversary of my [adoption][] of Linux on my
desktop PC so I thought I&#8217;d write a quick summary of how things went in
the last 12 months as I always enjoy reading real-life user adoption
stories.</p>

<p>Initially, I installed Linux Mint 7 (Gloria) on my aged Dell Dimension
and in the following weeks, I subsequently upgraded to Linux Mint 8
(Helena) in November and again in May 2011 when Linux Mint 9 (Isadora)
was released.</p>

<p>In April, I finally heeded some not so subtle hints from my wife and
bought her an relatively inexpensive Acer Aspire laptop for her
birthday. The machine came pre-installed with Windows 7 but, as she had
been gradually getting used to the Linux Mint interface and had never
previously used Vista or Windows 7, I took the rather bold step of
unpacking the laptop and surreptitiously installing Linux Mint. This was
mainly because I felt constantly switching between Linux and Windows may
prove to be rather confusing and hinder the drive for Linux adoption.</p>

<p>The laptop proved to be a great success and my wife initially used
[AbiWord][] to write essays for a part-time course she was studying. We
had the inevitable hiccup when she emailed AbiWord format documents to
colleagues at work who were unable to read them. Although I managed to
get AbiWord to use the Microsoft Word .doc format by default, I still
saw the odd compatibility issue which led me to install Open Office
[Writer][].</p>

<p>In June, my wife had to give a short 5 minute presentation for an
interview and created the slides in Open Office [Impress][] and then
presented her work, from a USB stick, on a Windows computer using
Microsoft PowerPoint. Although I had tested this route (48 times)
myself, this successful use of Linux software went down very well and
seemed to boost her confidence that using this ‘Linux thing&#8217; wasn&#8217;t so
bad after all.</p>

<p>My wife mainly uses the two computers for Internet access, email, simple
word processing and printing. It was quite interesting to see that she
fully expected everything (email, files, Firefox favourites) to be
identical and immediately available on both machines. Obviously, this
isn&#8217;t the case out of the box but luckily, my ISP, Virgin Media, had
recently converted to the Gmail platform with IMAP available so I
configured Thunderbird on both PC&#8217;s and, lo and behold, all her email is
simultaneously available on both machines as well as being backed up on
a server elsewhere.</p>

<p>For file synchronisation, I toyed with configuring simple network file
sharing between the two Linux boxes but as the desktop PC isn&#8217;t always
turned on, this wasn&#8217;t too attractive. I also installed <a href="http://www.dropbox.com/">DropBox</a>
which I thought would be ideal but, by then, the wife had already become
accustomed to sending documents to herself via email which did the job
just as well.</p>

<p>For browser synchronisation, there was a useful Firefox addon called
<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2410/">Xmarks</a> that worked seamlessly. Unfortunately, the Xmarks service
will be <a href="http://blog.xmarks.com/?p=1886">closing</a> down at the end of the year so I have converted to
<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/10868/">Firefox Sync</a> that seems to offer similar functionality if not quite
as polished.</p>

<p>As the year progressed, my wife increasingly used the laptop almost
exclusively and really only used the desktop PC for printing documents.
This was a blessing really as it allowed me to embark on a period of
concerted distro hopping to see what other Linux distributions were
available. After experimenting with Debian, Linux Mint Debian, Fedora,
Ubuntu, PepperMint and Arch, I eventiually settled on Fedora 13 (Gnome)
which is very stable and comes with all the main software packages I
use. Being based on RedHat, Fedora offers a nice contrast with Linux
Mint which is based on Ubuntu which, in turn, is based on Debian.</p>

<p>As for the future, well, my wife keeps asking for a quick Nautilus
tutorial on how to effectively manage and organise her growing number of
files as currently, her documents and downloaded papers from the
Internet are liberally scattered across ‘Downloads&#8217;, ‘Home Folder&#8217; and
‘Documents&#8217; and the temporary folder used by Firefox.</p>

<p>My wife seems quite content with Linux; in fact she recently recounted
colleagues telling war stories over lunch about their computers being
out of action after being struck down by viruses and having to purchase
a Microsoft Office license just to be ‘able to work on documents at
home.&#8217; My wife told them that her husband had installed this Linux thing
onto her computer so she didn&#8217;t have to worry about viruses and she used
a ‘free&#8217; version of Word.</p>

<p>From my point of view, the laptop is fast and still boots as quickly as
the day I installed it. No Windows or vendor crapware, no spyware and no
crippled, limited period anti-virus program suites to be uninstalled
which would have undoubtedly been the case had I left Windows 7 on the
laptop.</p>

<p>There are a couple of minor irritations; printing on Linux is OK but it
is still difficult to accurately monitor the ink levels on the Canon
Pixma ip4000 without hooking up a Windows laptop and my wfie is able to
occasionally crash Open Office Writer simply by copying and pasting
content from Web pages into a document which is rather embarrassing.</p>

<p>The laptop runs Linux Mint 9 (LTS = Long Term Support) which means this
version will continue to be supported for a full 3 years until May 2013.
However, there is also the tantalising prospect of migrating to <a href="http://www.linuxmint.com/blog/?p=1527">Linux
Mint Debian</a> which looks and feels like Mint but decouples the
dependency from Ubuntu and is based directly on a rolling Debian release
which is quite attractive as, theoretically, this would never need
upgrading (as in a re-install).</p>

<p>Also, today, hot on the heels of last week&#8217;s Ubuntu 10.10 release, the
Mint development team has just <a href="http://www.linuxmint.com/blog/?p=1554">announced</a> the first Release Candidate
for <a href="http://www.linuxmint.com/rel_julia_whatsnew.php">Linux Mint 10</a> (Julia) today which is another possibility.</p>

<p>As for the desktop PC currently running Fedora 13, I quite like Fedora
as it&#8217;s stable, fast, looks great and offers a comprehensive list of
up-to-date software available in the repositories. Fedora also appears
to be gaining in popularity so I may well upgrade the desktop PC to the
imminent release of <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/get-prerelease">Fedora 14</a>.</p>
