  <div class="entry-content"><p>Two weeks ago, I was working in the beautiful city of Oslo. After a
couple of hours, the client finally couldn&#8217;t take any more of my tedious
hand-waving and badly drawn architecture diagrams so he suggested we had
a five minute coffee break.</p>

<p>In the immaculate pine kitchen, my eyes were drawn to a notice in
Norwegian affixed to the kitchen cupboard. One of my hosts smiled and
said &#8216;I bet you don&#8217;t know what that says&#8217;.</p>

<p>Quick as a flash, I replied &#8216;Oh I bet you a pint of expensive beer that
I do.&#8217;</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;Please, please wash up your plates and mugs. Your mother doesn&#8217;t work
here&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>&#8216;God that is absolutely amazing. Why didn&#8217;t you say you spoke Norwegian
?&#8217;</p>

<p>In a similar vein, Andrew
<a href="http://andrewsherman.blogspot.com/2007/05/best-blog-in-world.html">Sherman</a>
brings my attention to a marvellous
<a href="http://www.passiveaggressivenotes.com/">blog</a> devoted to
passive-aggressive notices posted in office kitchens, officious post-its
stuck on fridge doors and not-so-polite notices hanging on toilet walls
from all around the world.</p>

<p>If only I&#8217;d known, I would have taken a photo of this British
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/12/07/british-toilet-humour/">entry</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I usually hate posts that start</p>

<p>&#8216;Apologies in advance but I am going to be offline for 10 days
because&#8230;&#8217;</p>

<ul>
<li>I am going to a Web 2.0 conference in Dallas</li>
<li>I smashed my hand into a glass window</li>
<li>I am going on vacation</li>
<li>I am really busy at work</li>
<li>Personal stuff</li>
<li>I am getting married</li>
<li>I am going to an Oracle conference in Scotland</li>
<li>The RSI is killing me</li>
<li>My boss/wife/dog discovered this blog</li>
<li>I am having a blogging crisis of confidence</li>
<li>Family matters</li>
</ul>


<p>Mainly because the author inevitably pops up the very next day without
any further explanation.
Apologies in advance but I am going to be offline for 10 days because
the postman delivered a package today. Well, more like a suspect
<a href="http://www.directusbstore.co.uk/cnb/shop/directusbstore?productID=64&amp;search=firewire+pci+card&amp;op=catalogue-product_info-null">device</a>,
actually.</p>

<p>A couple of months ago, I foolishly purchased a digital
<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000MK3XVQ/202-2183615-0611840">camcorder</a>
and now face the unenviable task of transferring the footage to DVD. I
have procrastinated for long enough. My long list of excuses is
exhausted. &#8216;No - we can&#8217;t simply to transfer to VHS tape because we now
own a digital camcorder. What on earth would the neighbours think ?&#8217;</p>

<p>I thought I had stumbled upon the perfect excuse. Not one of our modern
computers is equipped with a Firewire port to connect the Sony camcorder
to the PC. But no. Even that was rejected so I was forced to research
all the options and finally purchase a Firewire PCI card and cable.</p>

<p>This means I am going to have to open the lid on my computer. However, I
can approach this particular task with a great deal of confidence. Last
week, I surmounted this hurdle to check that my aged computer has an
available PCI slot. It only took me 25 minutes.</p>

<p>So, after I have finished work tonight, if I am not too tired, as long
as no-one invites me to the pub and if there is nothing on the telly, I
won&#8217;t be donning a anti-static wrist strap but touching wood (and the
metal PC case). However, it is likely that I&#8217;ll still manage to blow the
power supply.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The recent
<a href="http://scobleizer.com/2007/05/23/dog-distrustdisdain-of-google-moves-in/">storm</a>
in the
<a href="http://www.therssweblog.com/?guid=20070524110855">anti-blogosphere</a>

<a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/05/23/100-million-payday-for-feedburner-this-deal-is-confirmed/">acquiring</a>
<a href="http://www.feedburner.com">Feedburner</a>, the frightening
<a href="http://www.geeknewscentral.com/archives/007047.html">prospect</a> of
Google placing ads in your precious feeds, capturing all your personal
data, monitoring your every movement (online and offline) and logging
your brainwaves into the Google data warehouse is starting to irritate
me.</p>

<p>Despite the corporate
<a href="http://investor.google.com/conduct.html">motto</a>, please remember
Google is evil and 2084 is just around the corner, folks. Be aware
that Google just announced a partnership with global law enforcement
agencies to upload all CCT footage to YouTube.</p>

<p>Thankfully, some
<a href="http://marshallk.com/why-buying-feedburner-is-really-smart-of-google">intelligent</a>
<a href="http://andybeard.eu/2007/05/77-reasons-why-google-buying-feedburner-is-a-match-made-in-heaven-hell.html">people</a>
are able to distance themselves from the hype and present a more
<a href="http://scobleizer.com/2007/05/24/another-reason-i-use-google-reader/">balanced</a>
viewpoint.</p>

<p>Another irritant is idiots bleating, ironically enough, in Google
Groups about the lack of
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/analytics-help-basics/browse_frm/thread/648a3ded5712a1e7/2f37bba1b8a3346c?lnk=gst&amp;q=monthly&amp;rnum=2#2f37bba1b8a3346c">monthly</a>
reports in the revamped Analytics and
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/Google-Labs-Reader/browse_frm/thread/46ecef4ffd2722da">deficiencies</a>
in Reader.</p>

<p>If you don&#8217;t like Analytics V2, go back to <a href="http://sitemeter.sitetoolbox.com/">Site
Meter</a> to track your e-commerce
site.  Let me know how you get on.</p>

<p>If you can&#8217;t stand <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/view/">Reader</a>, shut
up and go back to
<a href="http://www.vecosys.com/2007/05/24/i-hate-the-bloglines-plumber/">Bloglines</a>
and moan about that instead.</p>

<p>If you can no longer tolerate the unreliability and limitations of
Docs and Spreadsheets, upgrade to Office 2007 and use Word and
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/09/14/google-versus-microsoft/">Excel</a>.
The choice is yours.</p>

<p>I
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/02/19/am-i-a-google-whore-yet/">use</a>
a lot of Google products (Gmail, Reader, Calendar, Analytics,
Notebook,
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/03/07/in-praise-of-google-desktop/">Desktop</a>,
Bookmarks, IG,
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/10/11/google-docs-and-spreadsheets/">Docs</a>,
Groups, Webmaster, Adsense oh and, err that Search thingy). My view is
that all are excellent, innovative software products and, best of all,
completely free of charge.</p>

<p>I really don&#8217;t care that Google has stored every single keyword
related to my searches from October 1991.</p>

<p>I honestly don&#8217;t care that Google has copies of my homework
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/06/05/novel-homework-excuse/">excuses</a>
and letters to the Inland Revenue. Believe me, the contents are really
not that earth shattering.</p>

<p>I truly don&#8217;t care that Google has copies of every single email I have
ever sent and received because, surprisingly, I have nothing to
hide. I only wish Google could get behind corporate firewalls and
retrieve the remainder as I have lost some magnificent blogging
material over the years.</p>

<p>If you are genuinely worried that Google is going to tell you what to
&#8217;<a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/c3e49548-088e-11dc-b11e-000b5df10621.html">eat for
tea</a>&#8217;,
maybe you should do the world a favour and start a protest on behalf
of all Interweb users by going on an indefinite hunger
strike. Immediately.</p>

<p>If you are a child molester or jumped the
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/l/liverpool/6686867.stm">turnstiles</a>
last night in Athens, then, by all means, please disable all cookies,
use <a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/05/11/dont-ask/">Ask.com</a> or
give your computer to charity.</p>

<p>As for me, I am putting my money where my mouth in. The next purchase
in my
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2005/11/21/my-personal-pensions-crisis/">SIPP</a>
will be the purchase of &pound;7,000 of
<a href="http://finance.google.com/finance?q=goog">GOOG</a> stock. Tomorrow.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have had an innate
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/01/06/who-wants-to-be-an-adsense-millionaire/">fascination</a>
with Google <a href="http://www.google.com/adsense/">Adsense</a> and the correct
spelling of monetization for a while.</p>

<p>Countless times, I was poised to hit the &#8216;Unsubscribe&#8217; button while
hovering over John <a href="http://www.johnchow.com/">Chow</a>&#8217;s blog. But every
single time, I stopped myself. Is this guy for real ? Is he really
making thousands of dollars every months from blogging ? Does he
really eat in those posh restaurants ?</p>

<p>This decision to place banner ads and a sponsored search box on this
site was not taken lightly and sincere apologies to all my principled,
minimalist, long-standing, traditionalist readers.</p>

<p>Rest assured, the banner ads will only remain in place until I have
raised the sum of &pound;70 to pay for a replacement bathroom door in
my Prague <a href="http://www.hotel-yasmin.cz/en/location.html">hotel</a> room</p>

<p>After a mere 10 minutes, my newly created Adsense account was
unbelievably showing an incredible return of $0.34. If this income
stream is sustained, I calculate I will have generated $14,000
(&pound;7,300) within one month and &pound;87,000 in my first year !</p>

<p>However, on reflection, I assume this surge in activity was caused by
my lengthy trials and tribulations with the WordPress
<a href="http://www.acmetech.com/blog/2005/07/26/adsense-deluxe-wordpress-plugin/">plugin</a>
and getting the confounded advertisements to display properly on the
footer.</p>

<p>These experiments (767 clicks all by me) probably constituted a breach
of the Adsense Terms and Conditions so now I have the mighty
<a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a> suing me as well as
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2005/12/22/confession-time/">Amazon</a>.
Sigh.</p>

<p>Anyway, back to the original reason for the need to raise some capital
quickly. This evening, when I returned to room 516, I was informed by
reception that there is a small dent in the bathroom door. I thanked
them for letting me know, said it was no problem and they could fix it
tomorrow morning.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, events then took a bizarre and sinister twist when the
head of housekeeping maintained I must have been responsible as the
hole wasn&#8217;t there prior to me checking in.</p>

<p>However, I am not so sure. Honestly, I can not recall kicking the door
in a fit of pique, my feet don&#8217;t hurt and my toes are not bruised.
Still, the evidence is stacked against me.</p>

<p>Unless I can stage a CrimeWatch style reconstruction, tomorrow
morning, to prove that a maid&#8217;s trolley laden with shampoo, lemon
scented body wash and fresh flannels was forcefully rammed into the
door by a disaffected and underpaid employee, I am in a very weak
position.</p>

<p>Worse, I am told that I will have to foot the bill for a replacement
door which costs &pound;70.</p>

<p>Now I have occasionally expensed room service, wireless internet,
movies, laundry and sundries but submitting an expense report
including &#8216;Broken Bathroom Door&#8217; might be pushing it.</p>

<p>Still, with my Adsense revenues, I won&#8217;t be shelling out for a cheap
pastel blue door made from MDF, I&#8217;ll be buying the hotel.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>On 3 May 2007, a four year old toddler (not girl), Madeleine McCann, was
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6677803.stm">abducted</a> from her hotel
room in Praia Da Luz, Portugal while her parents enjoyed a well-deserved
pizza and a glass of wine in a nearby restaurant.</p>

<p>Since then the parents have launched a concerted and impressive campaign
to keep Madeleine&#8217;s name in the
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/6668801.stm">media</a> spotlight. The
distraught mother is carrying Madeleine&#8217;s grubby, pink cuddly cat
everywhere she goes.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the father flew home to England to pick up copies of the
Sunday papers together with clean underpants and shirts. He announces
the list of brands and colours of his top drawer to the assembled UK TV,
radio and press who dutifully report every last word.</p>

<p>A two minute video publicising Madeleine&#8217;s plight was played prior to
the FA Cup Final at Wembley on Saturday. Many fans reported it was the
most entertaining part of the whole afternoon. Posters of Madeleine&#8217;s
angelic, innocent face are plastered all over Heathrow Airport.</p>

<p>A &#8216;Bring Madeleine Home&#8217; web <a href="http://www.findmadeleine.com/">site</a> has
been launched and is groaning under the strain of large numbers of
deluded Daily Mail readers hoping and praying for a prompt and happy
outcome.</p>

<p>Celebrities have made media appeals, bands have offered to play benefit
concerts and captains of industry have offered sizeable financial
rewards for information.</p>

<p>While I am loosely following developments (it&#8217;s pretty hard to avoid), I
have a growing unease and sense of incredulity about this story. Not
just because I immediately feared the worse the moment the story broke.
When the pretty, young girl was not found within the first four hours,
wandering around disoriented in a hotel corridor or colouring pretty
pictures in the Kids Club, my instinctive gut feeling was always that
Madeleine McCann is dead.</p>

<p>I am a father and can only imagine what her parents are going through. I
completely understand and appreciate all they are trying to do is get
their beloved daughter back alive, praying to a God they don&#8217;t worship,
sobbing inconsolably at night, fighting off the horrendous feelings of
guilt, torturing themselves with &#8216;ifs buts and maybes&#8217; and desperately
clinging to a fading but faint glimmer of hope</p>

<p>I can partially empathise because my own daughter was nearly run over
when she was five years old. We were walking on a Saturday morning to
the newsagent. Suddenly, and unexpectedly, she ran out across the road
to get to the sweet shop and a car knocked her over, running over her
foot. If the car had been going slightly quicker or if she had set off 5
seconds earlier, she would have been killed. In front of my eyes. In my
sole care. My responsibility. My fault. Dead.</p>

<p>I still have occasional nightmares where I am standing over her grave
and people are saying &#8216;Andy - Listen, it was just an accident. There was
absolutely nothing you could do.&#8217; when all I had to do was not to
relinquish her tiny, precious, little hand.</p>

<p>However, I do not believe that I would go to a restaurant and leave a
four year old girl alone in a strange hotel room as I sat down with my
wife to enjoy lasagne and glass of wine in a restaurant ten minutes
away. There is absolutely no way that I would have left the two year old
twins (yes - two babies just two years old) alone in that hotel room.</p>

<p>Well that&#8217;s not completely true because I do really love pizza and I
strongly feel that parents have every right to enjoy a half-term break
as much as the children.</p>

<p>However, while I might have attempted to book the restaurant and change
into a collared shirt, my wife certainly wouldn&#8217;t. She would have been
fussing so much (&#8216;What if she rolls onto the babies and smothers them?&#8217;,
&#8216;What if she opens the balcony doors and falls 50 feet ?&#8217;, &#8216;What if she
is crying and no-one is there ?&#8217;, &#8216;What if she falls out of bed and
cracks her head on the tile floor ?&#8217;) and checking the room every ten
seconds, we would simply never have made it beyond the end of the
corridor.</p>

<p>Another interesting development is the &#8216;Maddy fund&#8217; to assist with the
search ? Is this to pay for the families extended stay in Portugal, the
father&#8217;s recent flight home or is it to bribe foreign police officials
for information ?</p>

<p>What happens to the fund if and when the search for Madeleine is finally
resolved ? Do all the contributors and Portsmouth Football Club (£50k)
get their money back ?</p>

<p>Or does it go into a fund for middle class professionals who can afford
two foreign holidays a year but are too mean to shell out for a
baby-sitter ?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&#8230;lies in your hands, dear reader.</p>

<p>Another baby when my wife is 57 years old ? - discuss.</p>

<p>My job title when I joined Siebel in April 2003 was &#8216;Junior Architecture
Specialist&#8217;. Four years later, it transpires that I am now officially
entitled to call myself &#8216;Principal Architecture Specialist&#8217;.</p>

<p>However, I have elected not to change my business cards and .signature
as I am simply not worthy. Please remember that I have worked with some
very talented individuals (past and present).</p>

<p>In any case, who needs more boxes of business cards gathering dust ? I
rarely dispense my business card to any client as I much prefer email as
the sole communication channel. This also avoids the possibility of a
customer calling me on Sunday evening to assist with a Service Request
escalation or go-live support. After all, &#8216;Antiques Roadshow&#8217; is
absolutely sacrosanct in our household.</p>

<p>Secondly, such a deluxe, overblown, Rolls-Royce description may set the
client expectations unreasonably high and this may lead to dashed hopes
and bitter disappointment (especially when dealing with me).</p>

<p>So when I cross the threshold of the modern glass-fronted offices,
extracting my contact details and preparing my firm handshake, I
normally introduce myself with &#8216;Hi, I&#8217;m Norman Brightside from Expert
Services. I know a little about lots.&#8217;</p>

<p>To be fair, this statement is unerringly accurate and leaves me with the
perennial &#8216;Get Out of Jail Free&#8217; card: &#8216;Oh I&#8217;m sorry - but that&#8217;s an
area of Siebel I am not intimate with&#8217; (which I tend to use a lot).</p>

<p>Last March, following the Oracle takeover, our group was going to be
re-branded as &#8216;Service Delivery Engineers&#8217;. All Siebel employees were
also eligible for higher rate tax relief on any dental surgery and
liposuction, if required.</p>

<p>I was abroad in Sweden and didn&#8217;t really care - after all, what&#8217;s in a
name ? - Expert Services actually do &#8216;deliver services&#8217; to customers
although we are not (software) engineers in the traditional sense.</p>

<p>However, some of my colleagues fiercely resisted this change with a
vengeance (think 1990 Poll Tax riots) which left me rather bemused. The
standing joke was that we would tell customers; &#8216;Sorry I haven&#8217;t got
that part on the van&#8217; and suck through our teeth &#8216;Hmm - this isn&#8217;t gonna
be cheap&#8217; when faced with a thorny performance problem.</p>

<p>I honestly wouldn&#8217;t care if Oracle called me &#8216;Overpaid, ugly code
monkey&#8217; as long as my salary and benefits were preserved. In fact, when
I was a mercenary contractor, I toyed with using this job title as my
official occupation on my passport.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, the revolutionaries prevailed and the corporation ruled
that we could preserve our job titles or upgrade, at no extra cost, to
&#8216;Electrolux repair man&#8217;, if we so desired.</p>

<p>Twelve months on, my contrarian instincts are twitching so what do you
think ?</p>

<ul>
<li>Service Delivery Engineer</li>
<li>Architecture Specialist</li>
<li>Technical &#8216;Consultant&#8217;</li>
<li>Amusing alternative</li>
