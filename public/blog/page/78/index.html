  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last week, I had to buy a birthday present for somebody. So, quite early
last Thursday morning, I found myself in a cavernous Tesco Extra
Superstore. You could buy anything there at rock bottom (close to
InterWeb) prices: digital cameras, MP3 players, Ipod&#8217;s, Plasma screen
TV&#8217;s, DVD recorders, SmartCars, absolutely anything</p>

<p>I must have looked purposeful and smart as an elderly couple mistook me
for a Tesco employee and asked me where they might find bread and milk.
I tried to be helpful and directed them to aisle 79 and gave them a
pre-printed &#8216;Employee of the Month&#8217; form to complete.</p>

<p>I then used the in-store guide to navigate my way to the music section.
To my horror, the one item at the top of my shopping list was nowhere to
be found. I checked the Top 100 Chart listing. This particular CD was
Number 33 in the hit parade. Inevitably, the Number 33 position was the
only slot in the miles of CD racks which was completely and utterly
empty.</p>

<p>Disaster. Initially I thought about just going elsewhere but then I saw
a young lady polishing her nails at the &#8216;Audio - Customer Service&#8217; desk.
I slowly approached and decided to come clean: &#8216;Good morning. I wonder
if you could help me. I really need to buy the 33rd best selling CD
inthe UK charts but there are none left on the shelves. Please could you
see if you have got any in the stock room out the back (or under the
counter) ?&#8217;</p>

<p>She paused, turned and looked at the CD chart listing. &#8216;Number 33 - Oh.
Do you mean James Blunt - Back To Bedlam ?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8216;Well, yes, err, but you must understand, this is a, err, birthday
present for a, err, very close friend you see, and certainly not for
me&#8217;.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh I understand, perfectly, Sir. I will just go and have a look for you
now.&#8217;</p>

<p>The young assistant smiled and shot me a knowing glance as she departed.
As she was gone for what seemed like an eternity, I continued to browse
the shelves and, suddenly, on impulse, I decided to buy the Arctic
Monkey&#8217;s CD. This was a risk as I had never heard any music by this band
and my all-time favourite music
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/02/23/probably-the-best-music-review-in-the-world/">reviewer</a>
had not even commented on this band yet.</p>

<p>The shop assistant eventually returned with &#8216;Number 33&#8217; in her hand.</p>

<p>&#8216;Thank you very much. And I would also like to buy this CD too. Look -
this CD is the Arctic Monkeys and I am actually buying this one for
myself.&#8217; &#8216;Oh I see, Sir. Are you sure this isn&#8217;t a present for someone
else ?&#8217;</p>

<p>So I buy the two CD&#8217;s and shuffle away. Then I consult my shopping list
(GTD context=&#8217;Tesco&#8217;) and I suddenly realise that I need to buy
something else. Mothers&#8217; Day is imminent and I also need to buy David
Gray&#8217;s latest CD.</p>

<p>Enough was enough. I simply can&#8217;t take any more. Time to leave. On my
way out, I spotted the elderly couple looking perplexed over in the
Garden, Conservatory and Motorized Robotic Lawn Mower section. I simply
couldn&#8217;t face buying the David Gray CD. I couldn&#8217;t face that girl&#8217;s
smirk again so I just cut my losses and bought 24 contraceptive sheaths
as it was much less embarassing and promptly left the store.</p>

<p>So, sorry, Mum. 24 Durex (Featherlite) may seem like an odd present for
Mothers&#8217; Day but I hope this article helps to explain why.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One reason I am slightly averse to presentations is that I once attended
a &#8216;Presentation Skills&#8217; course that unequivocally stated &#8216;There is no
room for humour in presentations&#8217;.</p>

<p>I fundamentally disagree with this assertion.</p>

<p>For example, I think this
<a href="http://tkyte.blogspot.com/2005/11/something-to-aspire-to.html">presentation</a>
is very interesting, thought provoking, refreshing and different. Does
it contain humour ? Not directly but then why are people laughing
throughout ?</p>

<p>It contains repetition, repetition, repetition which helps to enforce
the underlying point (selling his company).</p>

<p>It is brilliantly delivered and undoubtedly very well rehearsed but it
is memorable and different.</p>

<p>So today, I have slides with the following quotations:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;I can&#8217;t manage it. It is Siebel - Anon&#8217;
&#8216;I don&#8217;t understand it. It is Siebel - Anon&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I can&#8217;t tune it. It is Siebel - Anon&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Siebel is just some data in some tables - Me&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>This isn&#8217;t humour although it gets a (nervous) laugh but it is intended
to encapsulate the message of the next two days. So I will repeat these
quotes at various points to reinforce the message.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was just quietly unloading the dishwasher this morning, when my 10
year old daughter enters the kitchen and screams:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;HE&#8217;S DEAD, DAD, HE&#8217;S DEAD. LOOK DAD. HE&#8217;S DEAD !&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>Sure enough, Chewy, the 18 month old gerbil had got himself wedged in a
Xmas wrapping paper tube. Being slightly narrower than a toilet roll,
the poor thing had wedged himself in and was absolutely motionless with
his bottom sticking out of one end.</p>

<p>As I have never held the filthy rodent alive let alone dead, I summoned
my wife, Norma, from the shower. Well, she is a trained Intensive Care
Nurse after all. As Norma went to cut away the cardboard to free Chewy
and prepare him for cremation, we suddenly saw frantic motion.</p>

<p>Thank God, against all the odds, the poor creature is still alive:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;HE&#8217;S ALIVE DAD, HE&#8217;S ALIVE. LOOK, DAD. HE&#8217;S ALIVE !&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>Unfortunately the little gerbil was so frightened, he started thrashing
around uncontrollably like a rodent that had been helplessly trapped for
8 hours unable to see or move.</p>

<p>Consequently Norma inadvertently dropped him into the laundry basket and
spontaneously urinated onto my underpants and socks (Chewy that is, not
Norma).</p>

<p>This comedy of errors continued as Norma&#8217;s towel fell away as she
desperately tried to grab him and stop him entering the narrow passage
by the tumble drier.</p>

<p>In conclusion :-</p>

<p>Never, ever place Xmas wrapping paper tubes into your Hamster/Gerbil
cage, thinking &#8216;This will be fun&#8217; - it won&#8217;t.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well it&#8217;s been a while but tomorrow I will be resuming my battle with
BAA security
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/01/16/revenge-of-the-baa-queue-monitor/">staff</a>
as I pack my thermal underwear for a chilly Stockholm (near Sweden)
where I am hoping the Queen&#8217;s
<a href="../2006/03/19/by-royal-appointment">husband</a> will greet me at the hotel
reception.</p>

<p>I am giving a presentation (sorry, facilitating a workshop)
imaginatively titled &#8216;Managing Siebel on Oracle&#8217;. This should be fun as
this is completely new material and should include a lots of hands on
practical work which inevitably will provoke a lot of questions and
discussion.</p>

<p>Only one major decision is outstanding. Should I use the white
(understated, lighter, easy on the eye) template or the (dark, moody,
almost Gothic) black corporate template ?</p>

<p>Anyone who has seen Oracle presentations should know what I mean. <a href="http://tkyte.blogspot.com/">Tom
Kyte</a> tends to use White. Most glossy
S&amp;M/keynotes use Black. Guess what - I think I have just solved my
dilemma.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Djibril Cisse (tattooed neck, ridiculous shaved head) celebrating his
superb, individual, match winning goal (err, well, a converted penalty)
in front of the Gallowgate End at St James Park by removing his shirt to
remove a grubby white vest declaring his undying love for his wife, his
cat, God, Robbie Fowler, his late gerbil and dearly departed Lady Diana,
Queen of Our Hearts.</p>

<p>After all, I mean, his last goal was last year (28 December 2005) so

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Since the <a href="http://www.binarymoon.co.uk/projects/regulus/">Regulus</a> theme
was
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2005/11/29/new-regulus-theme-for-wordpresscom/">added</a>
to WordPress last November, I have stuck with it through thick and thin,
for richer for poorer, through sickness and in health.</p>

<p>Lots of themes have subsequently been introduced to Wordpress and I
always preview each of them but none of them look as easy on the eye and
as functional as Regulus.</p>

<p>However, I must say that the recently
<a href="http://wordpress.com/blog/2006/03/18/andreas04-and-thirteen/">added</a>
&#8216;Andreas04&#8217; theme is very attractive and had me dithering for a moment.
You can see this theme in action, down under, at
<a href="http://squash.wordpress.com/">squash.wordpress.com</a>, by Phil Sim, who
was obviously similarly impressed.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The British media may have given the impression in recent weeks that we
considered the German national tootball team to be a rather workmanlike,
efficient, collection of young talent coupled with experienced
internationals but lacking in imagination and devoid of much creative
talent.</p>

<p>Some less respected elements of the British media may have given the
impression that England&#8217;s recent, comprehensive 4–1 defeat by Germany
was somehow a freak result that was purely the result of a refereeing
error that denied England an equaliser.</p>

<p>However, after Germany&#8217;s dismantling of Argentina and yet another
comprehensive 4–0 thrashing of Diego Maradona&#8217;s team packed full of
world class striking talent, we are pleased to correct our previous
error and apologise for any offence caused.</p>

<p>We now acknowledge that Germany are the best footballing nation in the
World, rivalling the wonderful Brazil size of 1970.</p>

<p>We would like to issue a heartfelf apology to Bastian Schweinsteiger for
all those silly jokes we made about the translation of his name (‘Pig
Porker&#8217;).</p>

<p>We would like to retract fully the ‘Typical Germans&#8217; comment made by a
certain Sir Alex Ferguson of Stretford, near Manchester after Bayern
Munich had eliminated Manchester United from the Champions League.</p>

<p>We would also like to offer a fulsome 100% apology to Miroslav Klose who
has now equalled the number of goals scored in World Cup tournaments by
Gerd Muller. We withdraw fully the thinly veiled, insane accusation that
Emile Heskey would somehow produce more goals during this tournament.</p>

<p>We also would like to clarify the endless piss taking about the oh so
stylish blue polo neck shirts sported by the German manager, Joachim
Loew. The blue polo neck sweater is a stylish fashion statement and
reflects the smart, modern but casual manner of the way Germany plays
the beautiful game. Contrast this with Fabio Capello&#8217;s featureless,
dour, stiff grey suit.</p>

<p>Die deutsche Fußballnationalmannschaft - World Cup semi-finalists yet
again. We salute you !</p>

<p>But we still hate Michael Ballack.</p>
