  <div class="entry-content"><p>After the Yak was
<a href="http://nbrightside.com/blog/2009/10/14/yak-shaving">shaved</a>, we
suddenly realised we had missed &#8216;Football Focus&#8217; and proceeded directly
to the casting couch.</p>

<p>I fully appreciate that evaluating a Linux distribution is just 18
minutes and 32 seconds isn&#8217;t probably sufficient to probably gain a full
picture of the capabilities (or otherwise) of any software let alone a
full blown operating system.</p>

<p>However, this superficial, high level, cursory review of all the distros
below is useful as it solely focusses on the installation process, ease
of use - both of which are key for prospective Linux users; particularly
those people who might be looking to migrate, as in my case, from
Windows.</p>

<h2>Ubuntu (Hardy Heron)</h2>

<p>As I have installed Ubuntu before, this was fairly straightforward. As I
now had the full 80GB disk to play with, I allocated four 20GB
partitions (root, home, apps and data).</p>

<p>The installation prompted for my timezone, keyboard type and was pretty
quick. Once I rebooted, I was able to configure my Linksys wireless
adapter and access the network. As I was using a Ubuntu version that was
12 months old, the system update utility soon notified me that I had
over 800MB of available updates which I downloaded.</p>

<p>I was mortified to see the file transfer speeds was variable. Very
variable - it ranged between 35-50 KB/sec and I also noticed the
strength of the wireless signal was incredibly sporadic. On Windows, I
would consistently get a signal strength between 75 and 95%. This
computer was in the same room as the router with clear line of sight. I
tried browsing the Web - the experience was painful, It was like the bad
old days of 56KB dialup modems. I killed the system update which only
improved the state of affairs slightly.</p>

<p>I then discovered that there was a Ubuntu mirror hosted by my ISP
(Virgin Media) so reconfigured system update appropriately but still -
no improvement. A ping to ubuntu.virginmedia.com took 4-5 seconds - yes
seconds - not milliseconds. A ping from another Windows PC in the house
took 20 ms. This was a major concern and might kill this experiment dead
in its tracks with yet another Windows install beckoning.</p>

<p>Another of my concerns about adopting Linux full-time was printer
support so I was delighted to see that drivers for my Canon IP4000
inkjet printer were included in a comprehensive list and printed a test
page to prove it.</p>

<p>I imported photos, music and documents from my external USB Windows
(NTFS) drive (which just needed to be mounted as &#8216;root&#8217;). OpenOffice was
able to read all my Word 2003 (and 2007) documents, Excel spreadsheets
(and PDF&#8217;s were also accessible using Document Viewer. I could view
photos fine and I intended to use F-Spot to manage my photo library.</p>

<p>I was puzzled to see Evolution installed as the default email client so
I installed Thunderbird and configured it to access Virgin Media email
servers to send and receive email which worked fine.</p>

<h2>Mint 5</h2>

<p>Next, I installed another year old distribution - Mint 5 with the XFCE
desktop interface (as opposed to the more common Gnome desktop which
comes with Ubuntu).</p>

<p>Again, I simply reformatted the root partition and left the user data
well alone. Mint looked impressive and has a slightly better utility to
manage the wireless network. I was offered the chance to install
&#8216;Restricted&#8217; packages for proprietary software (e.g. the nVidia drivers,
Flash). Open source purists may object but I accepted the invitation. I
was rewarded by being able to play YouTube videos straight away with no
fuss. I recall hunting around on Ubuntu for ages until I discovered the
&#8216;Restricted-Extras&#8217; package.</p>

<p>My main concern, the performance of the networking seemed unchanged (not
wholly surprising as I believe Mint 5 is also based on Hardy Heron).</p>

<h2>OpenSUSE</h2>

<p>Next up was OpenSUSE which offered a slightly different administration
interface and a green theme. This was another old CD and I was gratified
and hugely relieved to see that OpenSUSE started loading system updates
at a decent speed (500-705KB/sec). If all else failed, I could also
revert to this distro although I wasn&#8217;t entirely comfortable with the
Nautilus File Manager after becoming accustomed to Gnome.</p>

<h2>CrunchBang</h2>

<p>CrunchBang was an interesting distro with a very different interface -
Black background, very minimalist with a handy system dashboard (CPU,
memory, disk utilisation) with all applications were available from a
right-click menu.</p>

<p>I really liked CrunchBang as it appeared to have a small set of
carefully selected and useful packages without being overly cluttered
with megabytes of additional software. I prefer distros with a compact
base where I can then install additional software as required.</p>

<p>If I was the sole user of the computer, I probably would have gone for
CrunchBang as the monochrome, minimalist beauty of the desktop was
appealing. However I doubted that Norma would be as comfortable with the
cut-down interface and funereal colour scheme.</p>

<h2>Fedora</h2>

<p>I embarked on the now familiar installation process but once Fedora
booted, I got a couple of disconcerting kernel diagnostic error messages
when using Firefox and the automatic system update failed. There was
also a worrying amount of blue - both during the installation process
and on the default theme.</p>

<h2>Debian</h2>

<p>I dearly wanted to love Debian as I get the impression it is the
distribution of choice for Linux officiandos and the technically minded
crowd. Also, it had lots of red during the installation process which
was very promising.</p>

<p>By now, I was getting bored of these time consuming full blown
installations onto hard disk so thought I would evaluate the remaining
distros simply using the Live CD approach and make allowances for any
sluggish performance.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Debian assume that Debian is the one and only and the
best Linux distribution for you so you will obviously be installing the
software on to the hard disk. For some reason, (as far as I could see)
Debian don&#8217;t see fit to provide a Live CD so people can choose to
evaluate their software so, once again, I found myself performing a full
blown installation.</p>

<p>Thus far, every single Linux distro had correctly auto-detected,
configured my Linksys wireless adapter and managed to connect to my
Linksys Router (running Tomato firmware) which was a pleasant surprise.</p>

<p>But not Debian. Oh no - although the WiFi card was recognised and I
could enable wireless networking, see the available networks, enter my
WPA credentials, Debian stubbornly refused to connect. There seemed to
be a worrying assumption that all wireless networks used WEP and I felt
I would have to do some serious digging to fix this and that somehow
because I wasn&#8217;t prepared to do so, I was unworthy to have the privilege
of running Debian. Maybe it&#8217;s some sort of Debian initiation ceremony.
In any case, life&#8217;s too short.</p>

<h2>Arch</h2>

<p>Arch is an interesting distro - it uses a character based installer. It
reminded me of installing SUSE Linux way back in November 1999 when I
had to recompile the kernel in order to get the mouse to work. Having
been spoiled by all the GUI installers, I was tempted to give up on Arch
there and then but proceeded until the partitioning utility decided that
I had overlapping partitions (which was odd as every other distribution
disagreed) and refused to go any further.</p>

<h2>PCLinuxOS</h2>

<p>Another short lived experiment - some obtuse failure meant I wasn&#8217;t able
to evaluate this distro.</p>

<h2>Mandriva</h2>

<p>Finally, I looked at Mandriva which was a great looking distro and very
user friendly. I particularly liked the WiFi management utility. It also
performed well (even booting off the Live CD).</p>

<h2>Ubuntu 9.04</h2>

<p>After all this effort, I still had a nagging doubt, that I was using
dated versions of Ubuntu and Mint that were more than 12 months old. As
there will have been a lot of updates and two full releases during this
period, I decided to burned two more CD&#8217;s for Ubuntu 9.04 (Jaunty) and
Mint 7 (Gloria). My main reason was to see if the problems with my
wireless Linksys card was resolved in the current stable version of
Ubuntu and I also wanted to try the Gnome version of Mint.</p>

<p>Sure enough, support for the wireless USB adapter in Jaunty seemed much,
much better and I was able to use the network normally and large
downloads were now as quick as with Windows and Open SUSE.</p>

<h2>Mint 7 (Gloria)</h2>

<p>The Linux Mint distribution is based on Ubuntu which means you can also
access the Ubuntu repositories which have a wealth of software packages.</p>

<p>I liked the look and feel of Mint 5 (using the smaller, lightweight XFCE
desktop) and was similarly impressed by Mint 7 (using Gnome).</p>

<p>The software update process is slightly more refined on Mint than Ubuntu
- updates are classified based on priority.</p>

<p>The clinching factor in Mint&#8217;s favour was the new Mint Menu introduced
in Mint 7 which offered a (I hesitate to say it), a start menu that
would be reassuringly familiar to Windows users.</p>

<p>The desktop interface was simple, stylish and uncluttered and I liked
the Mint management tools. Also, support for an Ubuntu based distro
would be easily available.</p>

<p>So that was it - after a day of evaluating various Linux distributions,
I decided to go for Mint 7. Now the boring bit was over with, it was
time to sit back and enjoy my new computer.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&#8216;How I ditched Windows and embraced Linux&#8217; - the prequel.</p>

<p>On Saturday morning, I thought it might be fun to install Linux on my
home computer. A year ago, I had experimented with a few Live CD&#8217;s and
actually installed Ubuntu (not officially supported) followed by Oracle
Enterprise Linux (officially supported) on my work laptop (Thinkpad
T61). For various reasons, I subsequently had to reverse that change so
I thought it might be worthwhile and interesting to install Ubuntu on my
own computer (an aging but reliable Dell 4500).</p>

<p>There was no problem with the computer, there was no problem with
Windows XP. I am not a rabid, freedom loving, Microsoft hating
individual. I just wanted to play around with Linux before &#8216;Football
Focus&#8217;.</p>

<p>As Norma also uses this computer (email, Web, Word documents), I decided
to install Ubuntu as a dual-boot option alongside the existing stable
Windows environment. This was firstly to evaluate whether Linux
supported all my various peripherals and software requirements and
secondly, let people continue to use Windows.</p>

<p>I dug out an old Ubuntu (8.04 - Hardy Heron) Live CD and started the
installation process. When I came to partition the hard disk, I chose
the &#8216;Advanced&#8217; option so I could preserve all my existing data with 60GB
allocated to Windows with another 20GB for Linux.</p>

<p>The re-partitioning failed; the &#8216;ntfsresize&#8217; program helpfully told me
with a typically cryptic Unix style error that &#8216;1028 is greater than
1024&#8217;. No matter - just get a Windows recovery disk and use the &#8216;fdisk&#8217;
utility to re-partition.</p>

<p>I booted from the Windows recovery CD. After a while I saw &#8216;Files being
copied for installation&#8230;&#8217; and wondered if I had missed the prompt to
enter a DOS prompt enabling me to run fdisk. So, I hit &#8216;Control-C&#8217; and
rebooted. As I expected, my computer was now completely screwed as I had
aborted during a full installation.</p>

<p>I sighed inwardly at my impetuousness and stupidity. I also blamed
<a href="http://identi.ca/davidmarsden">David Marsden</a> who had helped sow this
original tiny, little seed in my brain which was now turning into a long
running saga and a complete waste of time and effort. Just to get back
to where we had started. Almost.</p>

<p>This whole exercise was a classic example of <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2005/03/dont_shave_that.html">Yak
shaving</a>
as its finest. I was justifiably proud of myself.</p>

<p>I decided to postpone the Linux experiment to another day and simply
re-installed Windows. One hour later, the machine was usable again. All
my data was preserved so I took a full backup to an external USB drive.
However, although none of my programs were installed and the Windows
registry was pure and virginal, the &#8216;Program Files&#8217; directory was
horrendously cluttered with lots of unused folders.</p>

<p>Now I had a choice; dig out all those drivers and install disks for my
Linksys Wireless Adapter, Canon printer, scanner, reinstall and
reconfigure all the important software (Picasa, Firefox, Office, Outlook
Express) so the machine would actually be usable again. Preferably
before Norma got home and asked &#8216;Can I just quickly check my email ?&#8217;</p>

<p>Alternatively, now I had a full backup, I could do the right thing,
rebuild the computer completely and install Linux. So that&#8217;s what I did.
Only I didn&#8217;t because I wasn&#8217;t entirely sure Ubuntu was the best Linux
distribution for me. Using the excellent, open source program
<a href="http://infrarecorder.org/">InfraRecorder</a>. I embarked on burning ISO
images for all those distributions I was aware of, have seen recommended
or reviewed recently.</p>

<p>I also perused <a href="http://distrowatch.com/">DistroWatch</a> to look for the
most popular and used Dan Lynch&#8217;s excellent, comprehensive, honest,
balanced <a href="http://danlynch.org/blog/category/review/">reviews</a> of various
Linux distributions.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>[Obligatory hat tip to &#8217;<a href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/deploy/availability/pdf/defrag.pdf">How to stop defragmenting and start
living</a>&#8217;.
As an aside, if you&#8217;re an Oracle DBA and haven&#8217;t read this whitepaper,
please do so. Now.]</p>

<p>I have used various devices and software over my 76 years on this planet
to listen to music:</p>

<ul>
<li>Record player</li>
<li>Cassette player</li>
<li>Transistor radio</li>
<li>Ears</li>
<li>WinAmp</li>
<li><a href="http://nbrightside.com/blog/2006/05/02/sonicstage-34-released">SonicStage</a></li>
<li>Windows Media Player</li>
</ul>


<p>18 months ago, I finally caved in and bought an iTouch which I use a
lot; mainly for listening to music
and<a href="http://nbrightside.com/blog/2008/09/21/top-of-the-podcasts">podcasts</a>
at airports.</p>

<p>I duly downloaded iTunes in order to get my music library onto the
iTouch. I seem to remember that iTunes couldn&#8217;t play Windows Media
Player files which was slightly irritating. In any case, with a sense of
a new beginning and a fresh, clean start, I re-ripped all my music CD&#8217;s
into Apple&#8217;s AAC format, added the missing album artwork and
synchronised my music, photos and applications to the iTouch.</p>

<p>Over the last 18 months, Apple proceeded to add more and more &#8216;features&#8217;
to iTunes which I don&#8217;t want or need:</p>

<ul>
<li>Tighter integration with the iTunes store</li>
<li>Genius - some sort of recommendation engine closely linked to the
above</li>
<li>Jukebox</li>
<li>A default assumption that I also wanted to install additional
software packages: QuickTime, Safari and Mobile Me.</li>
</ul>


<p>When Apple recently released iTunes 9, I suddenly realised I was
downloading 98.4MB - just to play music.</p>

<p>It slowly dawned on me that, whenever I started iTunes, my (admittedly
aging PC) was unusable for 40 seconds while iTunes initialised and CPU
usage hit the roof.</p>

<p>I also realised that iTunes consumed a staggering 82MB of physical
memory while playing a tune and this excessive memory consumption could
increase to 134MB after connecting to the iTunes store.</p>

<p>I realised this was madness. Complete madness. Finally, I came to my
senses and sought out alternative programs to replace the oversized,
obese, bloated, multi-function and very slow iTunes.</p>

<p>I soon discovered <a href="http://www.foobar2000.org/">Foobar 2000</a> which is a
small, compact, lighweight audio player for Windows. I downloaded the
program and was immediately struck by the size of the Foobar2000
distribution - 2,985KB, 2.81MB or 3,056,036 bytes to be precise.</p>

<p>This was already promising so I installed the program. I was pleasantly
surprised that Foobar quickly imported my existing iTunes music library
in its entirety and I was immediately able to play AAC encoded music. No
need for additional plugins or codecs.</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.co.uk/lh/photo/j72CrvPfYSct0Vvix_8YvQ?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_l2uGy1RGCiE/StCL0v3-FlI/AAAAAAAABds/UmLwc6xn4aE/s400/Foobar01-DefaultPlayer.PNG" alt="image" /></a>
I was also pleasantly surprised to see Foobar 2000 start up
instantaneously (no delay or hourglass here) and consume a slightly more
reeasonable 25,888KB of memory.</p>

<p>However, all of this was redundant unless I could actually synchronise
music to the iTouch as using two completely separate programs to mange
my music was self-defeating. So I downloaded a Foobar extension
promisingly named &#8217;<a href="http://www.foobar2000.org/components/view/foo_dop">Ipod
Manager</a>&#8217; and
configured it.</p>

<p>For a complete fresh start, I took the rather brave (or stupid) move of
completely resetting the iTouch to the factory settings which deleted
all data and promptly hit &#8216;Sync&#8217; in Foobar.</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.co.uk/lh/photo/Nsg7rXG60ipEpz_LO4KK5Q?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_l2uGy1RGCiE/StCL01_lS1I/AAAAAAAABdw/4OL34SwFBtI/s400/Foobar02-iPodSync.PNG" alt="image" /></a>
Although it took a while, synchronisation was 100% successful and I even
got a &#8216;Preview&#8217; of what songs were going to added/removed from the
iTouch. This feature was incredibly useful as it gives you a chance to
abort if your entire music library is going to be (unexpectedly)
deleted.</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.co.uk/lh/photo/zutHo7-S2NN2Sj52E3RFEQ?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_l2uGy1RGCiE/StCL0xy2G5I/AAAAAAAABd0/hyx_dKTSFYU/s400/Foobar03-SyncPreview.PNG" alt="image" /></a>
There were some minor issues - not all album covers were displayed on
the iTouch. I discovered that iTunes embeds album artwork in the AAC
file. I preferred Foobar&#8217;s method of adding the album art to the folder
as &#8216;Cover.jpg&#8217; so you have complete control over the images used. Later
on, I actually removed the embedded artwork completely.</p>

<p>What else was missing ? I previously used iTunes to manage podcasts
although this was never really satisfactory as iTunes had a weird
concept of when the status of a podcast should be modified to
&#8216;Listened&#8217;. I rather thought listening from start to finish would
qualify but Apple obviously disagreed and repeatedly kept sync&#8217;ing old
content onto the iTouch.</p>

<p>Foobar had another useful extension called
&#8217;<a href="http://pelit.koillismaa.fi/plugins/show.php?id=270">PodCatcher</a>&#8217; which
worked brilliantly. It would automatically download new podcasts (in the
background) and I was able to easily sync to the iTouch simply by
including the new &#8216;Podcasts&#8217; category to the synchronisation list.</p>

<p>I wasn&#8217;t completely happy with the default UI of Foobar so I used the
<a href="http://www.foobar2000.org/components/view/foo_ui_columns">Columns UI</a>
extension to make it look slightly more usable with the album artwork
displayed.</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.co.uk/lh/photo/81HGcOdc-2A2KrJcSubnaw?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_l2uGy1RGCiE/StCL08HOoNI/AAAAAAAABd4/YRGEden4K4g/s400/Foobar04-ColumnsUI.PNG" alt="image" /></a>
Foobar 2000 really is the complete music player - once you add the
appropriate encoders, it can play virtually music in any format (FLAC,
WMA, AAC, WavPack, Ogg Vorbis et al).</p>

<p>One great feature is that Foobar can perform conversion between the
various formats. If I can summon up the energy to re-rip all my CD&#8217;s yet
again, I plan to rip all my music to a lossless format (FLAC) and Foobar
would dynamically convert to the required lossy, compressed format
during the sync to the iTouch.</p>

<p>Another couple of useful extensions for Foobar:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.foobar2000.org/components/view/foo_audioscrobbler">Audioscrobbler</a>

<ul>
<li>to upload my played songs (including those on iTouch) to
<a href="http://www.last.fm/user/andycowl">last.fm</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="http://www.foobar2000.org/components/view/foo_playcount">Playback
statistics</a>

<ul>
<li>generates &#8216;Recently Played&#8217; playlist.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>Although I am now blissfully almost iTunes free, I still need to use
iTunes to update the software on the iTouch but I am delighted to say
that is the sole extent of my iTunes usage. If I need to install any
applications on the iTouch, I can do that directly from the iTouch.</p>

<p>It was particularly satisfying to copy my Foobar configuration and music
library to my work laptop and completely remove iTunes from that
computer.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This morning I commuted, Reggie Perrin style, from my leafy suburb into
the heart of London by train. Nothing too unusual about that.</p>

<p>After I paid for my daily travelcard, I took my place on an unusually
crowded platform. An unusually crowded platform normally means only one
thing. An lengthy delay inevitably followed by an overcrowded, late
running train.</p>

<p>Sure enough, I soon gathered that there had been a fatality on this
section of the railway line last night which caused major delays and now
had a knock-on effect to this morning.</p>

<p>Naturally enough, I didn&#8217;t hear this update from South West Train staff
at the ticket booth or over the loudspeaker system. Instead I heard this
important travel status update from a gentleman in a smart, grey suit
(and not so smart white trainers) giving a blow by blow account to his
secretary, Julie.</p>

<p>The gentleman spoke with such a loud, clear authoritative voice, I took
the opportunity to thank him and suggested that he should get a job as a
station announcer. Thankfully, the delays didn&#8217;t inconvenience him that
much as his first meeting was only at 10:30a.m - a catch up on the Q3
numbers with Brian and Phil.</p>

<p>A train arrived. It was already overcrowded with standing room only.
Everyone attempted to pile on and most of them succeeded. I stood to one
side and watched the melee with a few other commuters who didn&#8217;t fancy
standing for half an hour, uncomfortably positioned, face to face,
desperately trying to avoid bodily contact with a young lady&#8217;s breasts
or worse, with your head positioned directly under someone&#8217;s sweaty
armpits.</p>

<p>Two minutes later, another train arrived. It was empty. Gleefully, we
all boarded and took our choice of seats in the empty carriages.</p>

<p>The train set off - it didn&#8217;t stop at New Malden and it didn&#8217;t stop at
Raynes Park. Even better, it turns out that we are on a fast service
that only stops at Wimbledon, Clapham Junction and Vauxhall. Only this
train didn&#8217;t stop at Wimbledon. Nor did it stop at Earlsfield. It just
sailed straight through both stations at great speed.</p>

<p>We also sailed straight past Clapham Junction (the busiest railway
station in England) which was a surprise to a couple of people who had
got up and stood by the doors, hoping to disembark. I spotted the
earlier train packed to the rafters with yet more people trying to
board, politely enquiring in a very British way: &#8216;Could you possibly
move down inside the carriage - possibly - at all ?&#8217;</p>

<p>Back on our train, no-one got off (even if they wanted to), no-one got
on and no-one spoiled the blissfully quiet environment with their mobile
phones and discarding their copies of &#8216;Metro&#8217; so I was able to enjoy my
high speed journey, listening to &#8216;Boxer&#8217; by The National, in a virtually
empty carriage.</p>

<p>As we approached the final destination (Waterloo) I was slightly worried
I was sitting on a ghost train with no driver at the controls. Briefly,
I wondered whether we were, in fact, even going to stop at Waterloo or
simply plough straight on through the buffers into the station
concourse, killing 34 people who were staring blankly at the
&#8216;Departures&#8217; board.</p>

<p>We arrived at Waterloo and thankfully stopped at platform 4. The journey
which is normally timetabled to take 29 minutes and normally takes
closer to 35 was over. In a new world record of 18 minutes.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last Friday, Norman Junior III emerged from his bedroom, looked
mournfully at me and pronounced in a quiet voice: &#8216;Dad - I&#8217;ve got the
three red rings of death.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Just have an aspirin and sit down quietly for a bit. Your mum will be
back soon.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No Dad - not me. It&#8217;s my XBox. It has the dreaded <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/907534">three red
rings</a> of death and won&#8217;t boot.&#8217;</p>

<p>And so we embarked on a prolonged saga that involved a fruitless hunt
for a two year old receipt that revealed plenty of interesting long lost
items but not the actual receipt from Game.</p>

<p>Then I contacted Microsoft about the prospect of repairing a faulty
console that was out of warranty and had subsequently fallen by &pound;100 in
price.</p>

<p>Much to my surprise, Microsoft told me that, for this specific hardware
fault, the warranty had been extended to three years.</p>

<p>Microsoft checked the date of manufacture from the serial number,
confirmed the box was eligible for the extended warranty and asked me to
courier the faulty console, free of charge, back to their service centre
in Frankfurt, near Germany for repair.</p>

<p>Microsoft sent me the necessary paperwork to ship the XBox to Germany
using UPS. In turn, UPS sent me a package label, invoice, receipt and an
export certificate.</p>

<p>I then booked an appointment with UPS to collect the games console at my
convenience.</p>

<p>And all of this was accomplished without speaking to a single human
being - except for Norman Junior III who is doing well and making a fine
recovery after going &#8216;Cold Turkey&#8217; from Call Of Duty.</p>

<p>It all sounds too good to be true&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have experimented at various times with both
<a href="http://tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a> and <a href="http://posterous.com/">Posterous</a>
which are hosted blog services. I tend to view them as useful services
for a scrapbook style blog, a linkblog, a lifestream or even a fully
fledged blog. If I was starting a blog today, I would probably use one
or the other.</p>

<p>Posterous, in particular, has been getting a lot of coverage recently
and I like the ease of use, the &#8216;Post by Email&#8217; facility and continue to
follow developments with interest.</p>

<p>I often describe Posterous as a &#8216;blog for people who don&#8217;t want a blog&#8217;.
For example, Uncle Harry doesn&#8217;t even know what a blog is and certainly
doesn&#8217;t need a blog. However, Uncle Harry is also perfectly capable of
attaching photos of his sailing holiday in Greece and emailing them to
his daughter, brother, wife, friends and colleagues. He could do this
using Posterous and, lo and behold, without even knowing it, he now has
a blog.</p>

<p>Posterous is a hosted blog service and until recently, was limited to a
single, universal theme. This didn&#8217;t particularly bother me as I quite
liked the plain, minimal looking Posterous design.</p>

<p>I also felt the default Posterous theme actually helped to reinforce the
Posterous &#8216;brand&#8217;. Whenever you encountered a Posterous blog, you could
immediately recognise it as such.</p>

<p>However, custom themes were a frequently requested enhancement by
(potential) users so Posterous have finally added
<a href="http://blog.posterous.com/posterous-theming-its-here-its-live-and-its-t">support</a>
for your own themes including pre-built designs, custom header images,
full HTML customisation and interestingly, the use of Tumblr themes.</p>

<p>Now I suspect that supporting &#8216;Tumblr&#8217; style themes out of the box was a
master stroke. Posterous users immediately have a wealth of pre-built,
attractive looking themes available off the shelf, free of charge.</p>

<p>Tumblr have even helpfully created a theme
<a href="http://www.tumblr.com/themes/recent">repository</a> for Posterous users.
You just find a Tumblr theme you like, copy and paste the HTML, dump it
into Posterous and you&#8217;re done.</p>

<p>You now have a lovely, stylish professional looking Posterous blog that
looks identical to a lovely, stylish professional looking Tumblr blog.</p>

<p>I love the way
<a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/09/17/posterous-adds-theme-support-continues-to-grow/">TechCrunch</a>
uses the the term &#8216;leverage&#8217; to describe the addition of this (almost
seamless - some blocks are not supported) integration with the Tumblr
theme engine.</p>

<p>Of course, all themes are just HTML and CSS but I can&#8217;t help wondering
whether the Tumblr development team and their own band of loyal and
passionate users feel quite the same way about this wonderful, new
addition from Posterous.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I believe <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1495692/Innocent-gentle-giant-Or-remorseless-thug-guilty-of-attempted-murder.html">Michael
Shields</a>
is guilty of attempted murder by dropping a paving slab on a Bulgarian
waiter&#8217;s head, putting him in a coma for 4 days.</p>

<p>I find it worrying and bizarre that Jack Straw sees fit to grant Michael
Shields a &#8217;<a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/crime/article6827249.ece">Royal
Pardon</a>&#8217;
in the light of an &#8216;oral confession&#8217; made by another individual when
Shields&#8217; parents just happened to pay him a visit.</p>

<p>Particularly, when Jack Straw was fully aware of this information when
Shields returned to serve out the rest of his sentence in England back
in 2006 and rejected an appeal as recently at 2 July 2009.</p>

<p>I believe that the Bulgarian authorities correctly discounted the
written confession of Graham Sankey, made way back in July 2005 from the
safety of England, on the condition that he didn&#8217;t stand trial.</p>

<p>Michael Shields was involved in football related violence. He should be
serving 15 years in jail for a vicious, unprovoked attack. He should not
be feted in the press as a gallant returning war hero. He should not be
allowed to attend another football match and should be the subject of a
banning order that prevents him from travelling abroad.</p>

<p>But he won&#8217;t. Michael Shields will be leading the team out at
Liverpool&#8217;s next home fixture and leading the singing of &#8216;You&#8217;ll never
walk alone.&#8217;</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know how the friends and family of Martin Georgiev feel but I
feel sick to my stomach and ashamed to be British.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Andy Murray&#8217;s hopes of lifting his first major were thwarted by
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tennis/8242435.stm">defeat</a> yesterday
in the last 16 of the US Open to Croat, Marin Cilic.</p>

<p>I like Andy Murray. I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;s a dour individual. I think he&#8217;s a
very talented tennis player who is focused and determined. I admire the
fact he coped with being sent to live in Spain at the age of 15 to
improve his tennis.</p>

<p>Occasionally, I have even stalked him by scanning his
<a href="http://twitter.com/andy_murray">Twitter</a> stream. Yes, it&#8217;s genuine.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not a pathetic &#8216;Little Englander&#8217; who hates Andy Murray simply
because he once said &#8217;<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/5128028.stm">anyone but
England</a>&#8217; on radio 5
during the 2006 World Cup. I thought it was a funny response during an
amusing exchange of banter with the interviewer, fellow Scot Nicky
Campbell, and his English friend, Tim Henman. Each and every one of my
Scottish friends would have said precisely the same thing.</p>

<p>Since my own lad started playing junior tennis at a competitive level,
my admiration for what Murray has already achieved (No.2 in the world)
has increased ten fold. However, the real reason I believe Andy Murray
will win a major tennis tournament in the not too distant future stems
from an incident a couple of years ago.</p>

<p>I was watching my son play in a junior Surrey tennis competition held at
the <a href="http://www.lta.org.uk/About-Us/National-Tennis-Centre/">National Tennis
Centre</a> in
Roehampton. I was walking around the 22 courts, admiring the excellent
facilities and killing time before he played his first match.</p>

<p>I walked along a balcony overlooking four, immaculate indoor courts.
Andy Murray was warming up with his coaching team. They were playing
keepy-uppy with a tennis ball and generally messing around. As word got
round the complex that Murray was present, a small crowd of aspiring
young tennis players and their doting parents gathered to watch.</p>

<p>I was surprised at the sheer number of people in the Murray entourage.
After ditching Brad Gilbert, Murray now employs Miles Maclagan (coach),
Matt Little (strength and conditioning coach), Jez Green (physical
conditioner) and Andy Ireland (physio).</p>

<p>Once the warmup was complete, the laughter stopped and Murray started
doing serious tennis drills. He was rallying from the baseline with his
coach. I watched in awe as he repeatedly and monotonously hit shots from
the baseline low and hard over the net.</p>

<p>Each shot was powerful and landed just within the baseline or even on
the line. I soon realised that that&#8217;s why tennis players knock up (or
&#8216;hit&#8217;) with fellow proferssionals. Most mortals or even decent club
players would be incapable of taking part in this drill.</p>

<p>Murray continued his exercises. He didn&#8217;t acknowledge the people
watching. In fact, I&#8217;m pretty sure he wasn&#8217;t even aware of our presence.
He was solely focussed on hitting that ball.</p>

<p>Another rally started. Murray continue to hit ball after ball low and
hard over the net. Occasionally, he&#8217;d readjust his position to reach to
a shorter or wider shot but he kept on returning the ball. Slowly but
surely, the pace of the rally and the variety of shots increased. Now
Murray was exerting himself but he kept on hitting balls back like a
machine - low and hard, each shot just skimming over the net at great
speed.</p>

<p>Finally, the rally came to an end when Murray netted a baseline shot. He
shouted &#8216;Oh - for fuck&#8217;s sake. COME ON !&#8217;.</p>

<p>Some of the parents assembled on the balcony looked aghast and told
Jocasta to shield her ears from such Scottish profanity and gently
suggested it was time to get a drink while I just continued to watch on
in admiration.</p>
