  <div class="entry-content"><p>After over five varied and enjoyable years working for Siebel (and then
Oracle) in Expert Services, I am changing jobs. However, I will continue
to work for Oracle as part of the group responsible for &#8217;<a href="http://www.oracle.com/applications/socialcrm/index.html">Social
CRM</a>&#8217;.</p>

<p>Although this was a internal transfer, my interview process was quite
unusual. Instead of being forced to massage my CV into Microsoft Word
format and send an email attachment to a faceless recruitment agency, I
was able to publish my CV using Google Docs and the whole interview
process was conducted by telephone.</p>

<p>A colleague had already thoughtfully pointed my prospective manager to a
blog
<a href="http://nbrightside.com/blog/2008/07/16/how-to-make-100-friends-on-identi-ca-in-14-days">entry</a>
that was loosely relevant and he also was keen to review more technical
oriented <a href="http://nbrightside.com/drupal/node/27">content</a> on my Siebel
related blog.</p>

<p>As an aside, you can only imagine the feelings and thoughts that flooded
into my brain when my colleague uttered the immortal words: &#8216;Hey Andy,
I&#8217;ve given your <prospective new manager\> a pointer to a couple of
articles on your blog.&#8217;</p>

<p>The role will mean a few changes for me:</p>

<ul>
<li>I will now revert to having difficulty explaining to friends and
relatives what I actually do.</li>
<li>I will probably spend less time in airport lounges and more time
with my family. Norma has already expressed grave reservations about
this element of my career change.</li>
<li>My manager will be in a different continent and timezone.</li>
<li>I will be contributing to a corporate
<a href="http://blogs.oracle.com/socialcrm/">blog</a> for the first time which
will necessitate a slight shift in subject matter, terminology and
slightly less of my dry, cynical, off the wall, British sense of
humour although I do intend to maintain this personal blog.</li>
</ul>


<p>I am currently tidying up a few loose ends in Expert Services and
embarking on a emotional, sell-out, European farewell tour to all my
favourite Siebel customers so I won&#8217;t actually be starting my new role
until mid-October but it will be an exciting change for me and I&#8217;m
really looking forward to it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recently got an iTouch and, as I have been commuting into London
recently, I have been listening to a few podcasts in an effort to
usefully pass the time.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/podcasts/digitalp/">Digital Planet</a> -
BBC&#8217;s short (30 minute) roundup of technology news. Tends to cover
new and interesting topics not on my conventional radar.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.rickygervais.com/podcasts2.php">Ricky Gervais</a> - Yes,
sometimes he&#8217;s repetitive and childish but Ricky Gervais still
produces occasional moments of pure genius that bring you to tears.
Also features co-writer Stephen Merchant and Karl (perennial
scapegoat) Pilkington.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.forimmediaterelease.biz/">FIR</a> - <a href="http://www.nevillehobson.com/">Neville
Hobson</a> is one of my favourite UK
bloggers and this twice weekly &#8216;For Immediate Release&#8217; podcast
(co-hosted with Shel Holtz) covers a wide range of developments in
social media and use of new technology in the Enterprise both in the
US and Europe.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/podcasts/ft/">Fighting Talk</a> - Like
Gervais, Colin Murray seems to provoke strong opinions but I like
his sense of humour and quick wit as he comperes a sporting &#8216;Have I
Got News For You&#8217; style quiz.</li>
<li><a href="http://twit.tv/twit">This Week in Tech</a> - Leo Laporte&#8217;s popular
podcast. If you&#8217;ve been away from Google Reader for a while, this
podcast is a great way to catch up with events from the tech world.</li>
<li><a href="http://linuxoutlaws.com/podcast">Linux Outlaws</a> - Last but by no
means last, my favourite podcast. Co-hosted by Dan Lynch (Liverpool)
and Fabian Scherschel (Germany), Linux Outlaws is a comprehensive
summary of OpenSource news, Linux distros, &#8216;Micro(soft) watch&#8217;
including interviews and feedback from the community. Informative,
honest and occasionally very funny. Love the theme music (created by
Dan) too.</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last night, I took a number 521, red, bendy bus from St. Paul&#8217;s to
Waterloo station.</p>

<p>As the journey progressed, someone insistently and repeatedly pressed
the bell to indicate they wished to disembark at the next stop. Nothing
too unusual in that.</p>

<p>At the next stop, again the bell was sounded early and rang repeatedly.
I assumed the &#8216;Bus stopping&#8217; sign didn&#8217;t light up as the individual
concerned continued to sporadically, but repeatedly and insistently,
press the bell.</p>

<p>All of this got too much for the South African lady sitting directly
opposite me, who was simply trying to ask her partner: &#8216;Why don&#8217;t you
tell me all about your day, darling ?&#8217;</p>

<p>I was forced to avert my gaze because the couple were now holding hands
and I am British. So I carefully and intensely scrutinised an advert for
London South Bank University.</p>

<p>The lady said, to no-one in particular, in quite a loud and very
un-British voice:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;For God&#8217;s sake, who the f**k keeps pressing that damned bell ?&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>The bus stopped. The bell stopped. We all looked inwardly into our free
copies of &#8216;The London Paper&#8217;.
The bus set off again and so did the bell. This time, the South African
lady unlinked hands from her loving partner and erupted:</p>

<blockquote><p>Oh, for f**k&#8217;s sake, the bus is stopping ! Will you stop pressing
that bloody bell, already !&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>As I was sitting directly opposite the disgruntled lady, I was forced to
avert my gaze in a very British way and, to my horror, immediately
identified the root cause of the problem. I don&#8217;t have the word
&#8216;consultant&#8217; on my business card for nothing.</p>

<p>A young man was standing in the aisle chatting to his friend. He was
leaning on a pole. Every time he leaned back, the bell rang. When he
stood upright, the bell stopped. When he rested on the pole, the bell
rang. Continuously.
I averted my gaze. Again. By now, I was nervously staring at my feet.</p>

<p>Thankfully, an Australian woman ended my discomfort by politely
interjecting</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;Excuse me, mate. You keep leaning on the buzzer and it&#8217;s actually
quite irritating.&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>The South African lady looked around with a look of disbelief and
complete disdain - if looks could kill, the young man would have
spontaneously combusted there and then.</p>

<p>My immediate neighbour started smiling inanely and the gentleman
concerned reddened and immediately apologised to the front half of the
bus:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;Oh I am awfully sorry and thank you. I was just starting to wonder
what that irritating noise was.&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>And with that, normal service (and near silence) on the 521 was resumed.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have a penchant for some of Oasis&#8217; tunes and, although he&#8217;s a City
fan, I also like Noel Gallagher.</p>

<p>I like his sense of humour, I like his professional Mancunian accent and
his occasional
<a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/premier_league/manchester_city/article4666342.ece">digs</a>
at United. I also agree with him that Morrissey&#8217;s lyrics are hilarious
rather than morose.
I also love some of his quotes. Just one recent, brilliant
<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/celebritynews/2567284/Noel-Gallagher-calls-Amy-Winehouse-a-destitute-horse.html">example</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;Amy Winehouse is like a destitute horse.&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>Having said all that and although I abhor physical violence and drunken
behaviour, this recent clip of Noel doing some impromptu stage diving at
a Toronto concert raised a smile.</p>

<p>If you want to skip the &#8216;Morning Glory&#8217; intro, the incident happens at
1:30. It was just a good job for the culprit that Liam didn&#8217;t manage to
get hold of him !</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have written before about the
<a href="http://nbrightside.com/blog/2005/11/21/my-personal-pensions-crisis">consolidation</a>
of my various pension pots into a self-invested pension plan (SIPP).</p>

<p>One slight
<a href="http://nbrightside.com/blog/2006/09/19/staggering-incompetence">irritation</a>
was that the Protected Rights elements could not be transferred so I was
forced to hold these funds in a stakeholder pension.</p>

<p>However, today I received an email from
<a href="http://www.sippdeal.co.uk/">Sippdeal</a> stating that the Government is
<a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/5ef147b2-706b-11dd-b514-0000779fd18c.html">lifting</a>
these restrictions and that, from October 1, protected rights
contributions can be transferred into my SIPP.</p>
