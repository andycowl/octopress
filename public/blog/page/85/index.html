  <div class="entry-content"><p>The Mayor of Liverpool announced that there would a extraordinary 5
minute silence held across the city tomorrow at 12 noon.</p>

<p>A special religious service will be held at the Anglican Cathedral and
the two remaining Beatles will reunite and record a special version of
&#8216;(Please) Let It Be (disallowed)&#8217;.</p>

<p>Robbie Fowler will indicate the start and end of the silence by holding
up five fingers. This is the number of European Cups that Robbie Fowler
has watched Liverpool win on TV.</p>

<p>Guests of honour at the service will be Boris Johnson, Phil Neville and
his father, Neville Neville.</p>

<p>Counselling will be available in job centres across Liverpool for those
affected by the tragic events at Old Trafford on Sunday afternoon.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in Manchester, people will not be bleating, moaning and
endlessly complaining about being taunted by Robbie Fowler holding up
various numbers of fingers to the away section in their recent 3-1
defeat at the Council House.</p>

<p>If you give it, be prepared to take it.</p>

      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday, I had a credit card transaction rejected which is always a
little embarrassing. Thankfully, this was over the phone and not in a
shop where embarrassed people would quickly avert their gaze, thinking
&#8216;Poor man, he&#8217;s probably lost his job. Just look at his clothes&#8217;.</p>

<p>Normally, such rejections happen because the card number or expiry date
was incorrectly transcribed and are quickly resolved - &#8216;No I said
607<strong>9</strong> at the end&#8217;.</p>

<p>However, this wasn&#8217;t the case on this occasion, so I called the credit
card company to check my card hadn&#8217;t been skimmed and someone was
blowing my outrageously high credit limit (that I never asked for or
wanted but was given to me by the credit card company, funnily enough)
on holidays, fast cars, gambling, online retailers, weekend breaks in
Prague and expensive gadgets.</p>

<p>Firstly, we have to dance the security dance where I am asked to confirm
my full name, address, postcode, date of birth, my mother&#8217;s maiden name,
the names of all my tropical fish, favourite United player and my best
album of all time.</p>

<p>Then I am asked for the fourth and seventh letters of my password
&#8216;without divulging the complete password&#8217;. For some reason, I find this
incredibly difficult. I can type the password in seconds but, to satisfy
this request, I always have to write the password out on paper and
slowly identify the requested characters (or digits). Then I have to eat
the paper which means I am unable to speak properly for 90 seconds.</p>

<p>So, let the straightforward enquiry begin. Hang on - wait a minute. The
agent is sensing a cross-sell opportunity.</p>

<p>&#8216;Are you interested in transferring your balance to us, interest free
for 6 months ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No thanks. I only have one credit card&#8217;.</p>

<p>A schoolboy error. The agent has a scripted &#8216;retort&#8217; ready for this very
weak &#8216;objection&#8217;.</p>

<p>&#8216;But the 6 months, interest free transfer needn&#8217;t be from another credit
card. You can transfer your ABC balance to your current account,
interest free for 6 months&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No. Thanks. I don&#8217;t have a current account with ABC. Now about this
rejected trans-&#8217;</p>

<p>Another fatal error. Again, I have said too much and the agent has
another &#8216;retort&#8217; ready.</p>

<p>&#8216;The current account doesn&#8217;t have to held with ABC. Any bank account
will do&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No thanks. I do not want to use the 6 months interest free transfer
offer for any credit card for any bank account now or at any time in the
future.&#8217;</p>

<p>Finally. But wait. The agent (script) has something else to add.</p>

<p>&#8216;Is is all right to call you Norman today ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes.&#8217;</p>

<p>Next time, I swear I will reply &#8216;No. I really would prefer it if you
called me Janet.&#8217;</p>

<p>And so, finally, to the rejected transaction. It transpires that a
sophisticated, pattern matching computer program using the latest AI
techniques detected that this transaction (Flowers for the wife)
contravened the normal pattern of usage (No flowers for the wife. Ever.)
and flagged it up as potentially suspect.</p>

<p>Alternatively, &#8220;Computer says &#8216;No&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>The credit card company immediately tried to contact me on the phone to
verify the validity of the transaction. However, as they were unable to
reach me on the phone, they rejected the authorisation and placed a
complete block on the credit card. I explained that I was probably on
the phone at that time to the merchant desperately trying to explain why
the transaction had been rejected.</p>

<p>So, everything was finally resolved, and the agent kindly unblocked the
card, I thanked them for their vigilance in the ongoing fight against
crime and everything was back to normal.</p>

<p>Well, almost everything. When I got home at night, I received a deeply
disturbing telephone phone call from an AI automaton who announced</p>

<p>&#8216;This is a call from ABC credit cards about a transaction on your
account today (normal female voice). MR NORMAN BRIGHTSIDE (abnormal,
very scary, synthesized male robotic voice).</p>

<p>So, I duly input my date of birth in the wrong format twice and then get
told off by a robot.</p>

<p>&#8216;Sorry - that is incorrect. Please call customer services for
assistance&#8217;.</p>

<p>I just read on <a href="http://www.thechameleons.com/">The Chameleons</a> message

Glancy</a>, died at
the weekend. I didn&#8217;t know Bryan Glancy. I never met Bryan Glancy. I
just happened to see him supporting The Chameleons in Camden back in
November 2002. Just very sad for his friends and family to think of
another young person gone before his time.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, four young people are convicted of manslaughter (not murder)
for kicking a man to

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Amazing news - whales have feelings and can understand humans.</p>

<p>&#8216;How a wave of human compassion will have comforted the whale in his
final hours&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;He&#8217;d have known we&#8217;re trying to help but it couldn&#8217;t save him&#8217;</p>

<p>But what was really amusing about the bottlenose whale stranded in the
River Thames story was that a friend recently returned from a holiday in
Canada where he went whale watching. He was unlucky and saw absolutely
nothing apart in a whole day apart from the bobbing waves. He then
returns home to London to find one sitting on his doorstep.</p>

was in the news recently where a entrepeneurial UK student sold

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.curiostudio.com/">GreatNews</a>, in fact. I just discovered
this RSS reader which is a Windows desktop RSS reader but can
synchronise with Bloglines for Web based access.</p>

<p>GreatNews is fast, has a clean logical interface, with an integrated
browser, highly configurable (2 or 3 pane display), supports newspaper
style for reading groups, drag&#8217;n&#8217;drop for organising folders, auto feed
discovery and perhaps most importantly, displays as much content as
possible (no ads), enabling you to quickly focus on what is of interest.</p>

<p>You can&#8217;t display the feeds into your preferred order but there is a
&#8216;Most Visited&#8217; view which amounts to the same thing.</p>

<p>So, I have exported all my feeds from Newsgator and will be trying out
GreatNews as my RSS reader now.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The BBC have a program called &#8216;Pay off your mortgage in 2 years&#8217;.
Tonight&#8217;s episode featured a couple from
<a href="http://www.thisisthewestcountry.co.uk/the_west_country/cornwall_redruth_camborne/news/CORNWALL_REDRUTH_CAMBORNE_NEWS_NEWS3.html">Cornwall</a>
with a mortgage of 90,000 GBP.</p>

<p>The program is moderately interesting for the various ideas people come
up with to earn extra income (not for the scrimping, living off baked
beans and giving up alcohol).</p>

<p>However, the program is spoiled by some very basic flaws.</p>

<p>Firstly, any extra income seems to be tax-free. If they did raise 45,000
GBP in one year, the Inland Revenue would demand a significant element.
It&#8217;s a shame but it&#8217;s the law, you see.</p>

<p>The mentor repeatedly refers to his very clever &#8216;accumulator principle&#8217;
which involves simply multiplying a weekly income of &#8216;X&#8217; by 104 to
determine the additional income over two years. He (and the
participants) seems to view this basic mathematics as some startling
revelation.</p>

<p>Secondly, the mentor also dangles the thought of all the mortgage
interest payments saved as an incentive to realise a livelong dream.</p>

<p>For example, he told tonight&#8217;s couple that if (surely when) they
eventually do achieve their goal and pay off their mortgage of 90,000
GBP, this would free them from the shackles of 22 years of interest
payments totalling 76,000 GBP.</p>

<p>The couple could then use this &#8216;money&#8217; to buy a large, light, airy
studio for painting and a home office.</p>

<p>The couple looked genuinely astounded and delighted. They did not have
the basic common sense to understand that the very intelligent mentor
had neglected to point out one important fact; to obtain this dream
studio, they will either have to raise a further 76,000 GBP (which might
take a while) or take out another mortgage.</p>

<p>Oh, the del.icio.us irony of it all.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Tonight&#8217;s Money Programme (&#8217;<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4598090.stm">&#8216;The world according To
Google</a>&#8217;) on BBC2 was
about the history, the success and the possible future diversification
of the popular search engine, Google.</p>

<p>Now I use Google a lot and to me it is an excellent, fast, free service.
I can hardly ever recall clicking on an ad that was presented alongside
a search (even if I am actually looking to buy something).</p>

<p>I use Google Groups for searching for technical information as someone,
somewhere at sometime has probably encountered the same problem as me
and better, someone, somewhere at sometime has probably, kindly,
provided the solution.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t particularly care if they track all my searches ever, aggregate
them or give them to the UK authorities.</p>

<p>I am quite interested in innovative developments like Google Earth. I
have a Google Mail account which I don&#8217;t currently use but might do in
the near future to replace my spam ridden Yahoo! email account.</p>

<p>I can remember when AltaVista was the most powerful, standard choice for
a search engine and they were discussing a flotation. I respect Google,
being founded by two students, coming from nowhere? to a position of
virtual monopoly, immense power and wealth.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t care if Google staff are all geeks with 5 million dollar houses
and rocket lava lamps in the Google colours scattered everywhere.</p>

<p>What I do care about is people continually discussing &#8216;Google O/S&#8217;.</p>

<p>Google have a suite of powerful software applications. Google may have
(ambitious plans) for an operating system. Google does have links with
other computer companies that develop operating systems (Sun
Microsystems).</p>

<p>IBM develop operating systems (AIX). Hewlett-Packard develop operating
systems. Microsoft develop operating systems. Linux in all its various
flavours is an operating system.</p>

<p>However, the last time I looked, Google does not have an operating
system.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>You spend 3 months watching your WordPress statistics bumbling along the
horizontal axis close to zero.</p>

<p>Some traffic dribbles in. The graph accelerates into 10&#8217;s of hits daily.
You feel better. You will persist with this blogging experiment for a
little longer.</p>

<p>At this rate, it may soon be time to consider a proper blog using
WordPress.org and Adsense to make the millions that eluded me during the
dot com boom.</p>

<p>Then those pesky developers from WordPress.com alter the Y-axis
dynamically, on the fly without even asking so the statistics now start
at 40 and the graph looks just the same.</p>
