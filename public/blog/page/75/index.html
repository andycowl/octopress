  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/01/27/unix-for-lazy-people/">lazy</a>.
I buy my gas from British Gas and my electricity from Seeboard. It takes
a lot for me to overcome my inertia and change provider to save money.</p>

<p>However, I am interested in Carphone Warehouse&#8217;s
<a href="http://www.talktalk.co.uk/talktalk/servlet/gben-home-Home">offer</a> of 8
M/bit broadband, unlimited UK landline and international (28 countries
including Australia) calls, all for 21 GBP per month.</p>

<p>This is much less than I am currently paying Telewest for an inferior
package of telephone and broadband services.</p>

<p>The only downside I can see is that the contract is for 18 months.
Obviously a lot depends on the quality of service Carphone Warehouse can
provide to this influx of new subscribers but worth keeping an eye on.</p>

<p>PS. Well I was interested but I just entered my phone number and
postcode to be told &#8216;Your telephone number is not on a BT exchange so we
can&#8217;t offer you TalkTalk&#8217;.</p>

<p>So that is why Carphone Warehouse can only offer coverage to 70% of the
UK.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I enjoyed these <a href="http://funny2.com/inflight.htm">quotes</a> from airline
staff with a sense of humour (via <a href="http://tkyte.blogspot.com/2006/04/just-for-fun.html">Tom
Kyte</a>).</p>

<p>A couple of years ago, I was on a British Airways flight that was making
its final approach to some anonymous airport in Scandanavia.</p>

<p>Quite suddenly and without any warning, the landing was aborted. The
plane stopped descending, quickly started to climb, levelled out and
then resumed a familiar, circular holding pattern.</p>

<p>I was a little perturbed but no-one else seemed bothered as though this
was perfectly normal so I stopped screaming, apologised to my immediate
neighbours, dabbed the sweat from my brow with a napkin and picked up my
copy of &#8216;High Life&#8217;.</p>

<p>The pilot announced:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;Ladies and Gentlemen. You have probably noticed that we have been
unable to land and are in a now holding pattern. This is because the
aircraft in front struck a bird during landing and the ground staff
are currently clearing the runway of debris so it is safe for us to
land. British Airways apologises for the delay to your onward journey
and the inconvenience caused. However, please spare a thought for the
poor bird.&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>Of course, the last sentence was my input but what a glorious, wasted
opportunity.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I go away to spend a few days sitting on the UK&#8217;s gridlocked motorway
network and I discover those chaps at WordPress have been making yet
more changes.</p>

<p>The Regulus theme has been
<a href="http://www.binarymoon.co.uk/2006/04/regulus-wordpress-theme-version-21/">upgraded</a>
to 2.1.1 and now includes bug fixes, support for sidebar widgets,
personalised header graphic and lots more besides.</p>

<p>In addition, every single post is now prefixed by &#8216;Posted by Andy C&#8217;.
This is completely superfluous in my case and I would dearly like to
turn it off. This is my personal blog. Who else is going to be posting
to it ?</p>

<p>Also, the categories and &#8216;Add comment&#8217; now appear at the top of the
article rather than the bottom which I also dislike intensely as it adds
distracting clutter.</p>

<p>WordPress have also added feed
<a href="http://lorelle.wordpress.com/2006/04/15/wordpresscom-new-feature-feed-stats/">statistics</a>
which is a welcome addition although the statistics are not as
comprehensive as those provided by
<a href="http://www.feedburner.com/">FeedBurner</a> so I&#8217;ll continue to keep the
Feedburner feed alive for now.</p>

<p>Oh - and before you all jump to signup at once - WordPress had an outage
over the Easter weekend.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Buoyed by my recent, successful firmware
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/04/11/wireless-upgrade/">upgrade</a>
of my Linksys wireless router, and for the sake of completeness, I
decided to upgrade the driver software of the Linksys Wireless USB
adapters to the latest version (2.0.2).</p>

<p>In addition, prompted by my wife&#8217;s perceptive question of &#8216;Is it not
working because someone has hacked into it ?&#8217;, I also decided to
increase the security on my embryonic wirleless network by disabling
SSID broadcasts and enabling MAC address filtering so only specified
PC&#8217;s can connect.</p>

<p>Apologies to all my neighbours. This is probably undue paranoia on my
part but if only you could have provided demerara sugar instead of
fobbing me off with caster sugar all those years ago, none of this would
have been necessary.</p>

<p>These simple configuration changes and software upgrades went
surprisingly smoothly. Until, of course, I came to complete the very
final task of upgrading the driver of USB adapter #2. This USB adapter
is identical to the (upgraded) USB adapter #1, was purchased around the
same time and was working perfectly on the old 1.x driver.</p>

<p>Inevitably, when I upgraded this driver, it stubbornly refused to
connect to the wireless network. I uninstalled, reinstalled, rebooted,
reinstated the original driver to confirm the adapter was still working
in the new wireless configuration but, still no joy. So this irritating
minor issue will now continue to nag away like a dripping tap until I
can be bothered to revisit it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have been experiencing more wireless
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/02/24/wireless-wierdness/">weirdness</a>
recently. What once was stable and reliable has become increasingly
sporadic, unreliable and damned irritating for no obvious reason.</p>

<p>I am not a networking sort of guy. I am not particularly interested in
wireless networking. I use WEP in an effort to secure my network and
stop my neighbours piggy backing off it but that&#8217;s about it.</p>

<p>I am ashamed to admit that, on one occasion, when my wireless network
was broken, I briefly piggy backed on an unsecured network just to
temporarily solve the problem.</p>

<p>I am even more ashamed to admit that, on another occasion, I simply
unplugged the USB wireless adapter and just plugged it into an
alternative USB port. Coincidentally, this just happened to work and I
thought I had somehow miraculously addressed the problem (but deep down
inside, I knew I hadn&#8217;t).</p>

<p>Anyway, my kids have been moaning about this intermittent access to the
internet for a while (can&#8217;t play World of Warcraft, can&#8217;t access email,
can&#8217;t use MSN, can&#8217;t do homework etc etc) but today there was an
important new development with very severe and wide reaching
implications.</p>

<p>I was affected. I was trying to work from home and couldn&#8217;t because my
VPN connection kept dropping as I got kicked off the network.</p>

<p>Time for action. Could this action be completed in five minutes ?
Probably not but let&#8217;s have a go anyway.</p>

<p>I connected my laptop in directly to the Blueyonder cable modem with an
Ethernet cable and the internet connection is fine. No need to waste
anyone&#8217;s time by calling Telewest technical support.</p>

<p>Then I connected the laptop directly in to a wired port on the Linksys
wireless router and, again, the connection is rock solid.</p>

<p>So I head over to <a href="http://www.linksys.com/">www.linksys.com</a> and
register for an account as a precursor to searching the FAQ and support
forums. Then I register the wireless router so I can check the latest
available firmware version for this model - WRT54G (V2.0).</p>

<p>The latest firmware version is 4.20.7 (dated 25 August 2005). I check
the current firmware version and am surprised to discover that I am
running version 2.02.7 which dates from the 2004 Jurassic period.</p>

<p>Ooh - how exciting. A difference of two in the &#8216;major&#8217; version number
for the firmware. Why this is akin to upgrading from Oracle 8i (RULE) to
Oracle 10g (ALL_ROWS) ! I immediately download the software and briefly
pause for a moment to read the dire warnings on the Admin screens about
&#8216;Only upgrade the router firmware if you are experiencing problems&#8217;.</p>

<p>I fleetingly worry that this is an American company and I stupidly
reside in England so the firmware may be incompatible and could break
absolutely everything. Then I take a sharp intake of breath and I press
the inviting &#8216;Upgrade the firmware now&#8217; button.</p>

<p>The firmware upgrade is successful ! There are some new menu options
visible on the Administration screens. The firmware version is now
listed as version 4.20.7.</p>

<p>I reconfigure to Channel 7 as Channel 11 is so &#8216;last year&#8217; and also
limit connections to 802.11G only.</p>

<p>Everyone is reconnected, connectivity is much improved and very stable
with no drop outs thus far. Service to the
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/03/28/simple-things/">InterWeb</a> is
restored !</p>

at the airport.</p>

<p>Today I went to a meeting in a conference

listened, answered a few questions and asked a few questions.</p>

<p>Then I flew home from Stockholm airport.</p>

<p>18 hours in Stockholm and I never left the airport complex. Weird.</p>
