  <div class="entry-content"><p>Oracle Corporation - Redwood Shores, near California.</p>

<p>Oracle today announced the release of a major maintenance release of
version 11g of the companies flagship database server product.</p>

<p>Charles Phillips took the world by surprise by making a major
annnoucement a full six months ahead of Oracle Open World as he
addressed the media (including 17 carefully selected representatives
from the blogging community):</p>

<p>&#8216;This release is the culmination of years of engineering effort aimed at
delivering deterministic and reliable performance with the very highest
levels of throughput. Oracle 11gR7 offers proven scalability for all
Oracle applications including universal support for third party (aka
legacy) applications while simultaneously reducing the cost of ownership
and maximising the return on investment for all our customers.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oracle are delighted to annouce the immediate availability of Release
11.1.0.7.0 which is now available for every single platform (well apart
from OpenVMS).&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;The release includes the productisation of a previously, hidden
parameter known only to highly paid consultants. Previously, the
configuration setting could only be invoked by dressing up in long white
robes, waving a magic wand while dancing over sheep&#8217;s entrails and
simultaneously chanting holy, mystical incantations. The parameter
previously known as &#8216;_GO_FASTER&#8217; is now available as a documented
SPFILE parameter with possible values of &#8216;FALSE, SAFE, CHEAP, TRUE or
TURBO.&#8217;</p>

<p>Wall Street analysts were staggered at the news and, as soon as they
sober up after yet another Web 2.0 lunch, they will give their carefully
considered verdict but the Oracle stock price is expected to rocket
following the press release.</p>

<p>Oracle also hopes to have a back-port for Oracle 10g and the legacy
Oracle 9i database server available by the end of the month.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>London, near England - 28 February 2008</p>

<p>Arsenal Football Club were left reeling following another hammer blow
to their chances of winning the Premiership. Last night, the French
international defender and club captain, William Gallas was sectioned
under the mental health act. A spokesman commented: &#8216;This is an
unusual step but the action was necessary for the safety of the
individual and those around him.&#8217;</p>

<p>Investigations reveleaed that William Gallas&#8217; mental fragility was
long standing and deep rooted. Our intrepid reporter tracked down his
parents in Asni√®res-sur-Seine:</p>

<p>&#8216;Mais oui, Willy would often scream and thrash around on the floor if
his elder sister played with his favourite blue train engine.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;But that&#8217;s not unusual behaviour for a toddler.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Certainment mais Willy was 23 years old at the time.&#8217;</p>

<p>Gerard Houlier of Olympic Marseille also remembers Gallas&#8217; fiery
temperament: &#8216;He once head butted the head coach for berating him for
a single, misplaced pass in training.&#8217;</p>

<p>Jose Mourinho also endured a volatile relationship with Gallas: &#8216;He
disliked playing at left-back. We often had to make him sit in the
&#8216;naughty corner&#8217; until he relented. Gallas never really forgave me for
giving away his beloved number 13 shirt to Michael Ballack. This was a
punishment for turning up late for pre-season training. The last straw
came when he threatened to score an own goal or concede a penalty in a
crucial game against Manchester City. The guy is mentally unstable and
we feared no-one on their right minds would buy him.&#8217;</p>

<p>Fortunately for Chelsea, fellow Frenchman Arsene Wenger miraculously
&#8216;had not seen&#8217; any of these previous incidents and paid &pound;5
million plus Ashley Cole to secure Gallas&#8217; services.</p>

<p>Initially, things went reasonably well for Gallas who thrived on the
Arsenal captaincy and quickly established himself as a favourite with
Arsenal fans at The Emirates.</p>

<p>Sadly, the wheels started to come off for William Gallas in February
2008. Back at Old Trafford, the scene of the &#8216;death of the immortal
49&#8217;ers&#8217;, Gallas endured a torrid afternoon in a 4-0 FA cup defeat and
was tormented for 90 minutes by Wayne Rooney.</p>

<p>Gallas lost control after Nani taunted Arsenal by indulging in a quick
demonstration of ball juggling skills. This showboating was brought to
a premature end by a swift and full blooded tackle from Flamini and
later, by a viscous reprisal, from Gallas himself.</p>

<p>A week later, Gallas was tipped over the edge by a combination of
unfortunate events at St Andrews. Following Eduardo&#8217;s horrific injury,
missing a chance to seal a crucial win 3-1 over Birmingham, then being
denied a penalty, Gallas finally lost control and his sanity by
another controversial refereeing decision when a injury time penalty
allowed Birmingham to secure a 2-2 draw and deny Arsenal two vital
points.</p>

<p>Gallas, the club captain, left his position and sat down distraught in
the opposition half. Psychologists think this may be a cry for help
and a regression to the &#8216;naughty corner&#8217; punishment. When James
McFadden converted the penalty, Gallas launched an unprovoked attack
on an advertising hoarding, obstinately remained on the pitch and had
to be lured back to the dressing room by Wenger, Pat Rice and two men
in white coats.</p>

<p>Gallas&#8217; late night arrival at the mental institution triggered the
departure of another high profile football star with well publicised
problems. Paul Gascoigne, 40 of Gateshead, immediately discharged
himself after a brief chat with Gallas: &#8216;God I thought I had
problems. I realise I am battling the demons in my head and trying to
overcome long standing addictions to drugs, alcohol and false breasts
but compared to Willy, I just feel like a fraud even being in
here. Let me out now but please, just don&#8217;t tell him I&#8217;ve nicked his
blue Thomas the Tank engine.&#8217;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The forthcoming release of WordPress 2.5 was one reason I was hesitant
to move to Habari.</p>

<p>However, having seen a
<a href="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2008/02/14/wordpress-25-demo-site/">demo</a>
of the revised dashboard in WordPress 2.5, all I can say is I am glad I
made the move and didn&#8217;t wait.</p>

<p>While I am merely an end user (not a UI designer), Michael Heilemann
articulates many of my views on the deficiences and
usability<a href="http://binarybonsai.com/archives/2008/02/10/interface-screencast-1-the-wordpress-dashboard/"></a>
of the Wordpress dashboard in this detailed
<a href="http://binarybonsai.com/archives/2008/02/10/interface-screencast-1-the-wordpress-dashboard/">analysis</a>.</p>

<p>Michael also
<a href="http://binarybonsai.com/archives/2008/02/12/interface-screencast-2-the-wordpress-23-write-page/">dissects</a>
the design of the WordPress &#8216;Write Page&#8217; screen. The &#8216;Write Page&#8217; is
probably the most important one for the blog author as that&#8217;s where he
spends most of his time. I agree with Michael - the page is cluttered
with unnecessary distractions</p>

<p>Compare the WordPress page with the &#8216;blank canvas&#8217; presented by the
article editor in Habari.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>&#8216;Those who forget the past are condemned to relive it.&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>The migration of this blog from WordPress to Habari is mostly complete.</p>

<p>I had a few unexpected problems with a significant number of comments
and a handful of posts that contained mismatched HTML tags and didn&#8217;t
display the corresponding page at all. So I had to painstakingly review
every single post with comments and correct the HTML by hand.</p>

<p>Inevitably, I forgot the lesson of my previous
<a href="../2006/09/30/from-wordpresscom-to-wordpressorg">migration</a> and didn&#8217;t
give any regular readers advance warning of the impending chaos or any
notice of the change in RSS feeds. That&#8217;s not because I don&#8217;t care, but
rather that I treat this blog as a chance to experiment with the
technology.</p>

<p>Worse, I didn&#8217;t sever the link to Feedburner during the housekeeping so
peppered existing readers with duplicate, outdated articles.</p>

<p>So, whether you are a (non-Feedburner) subscriber who is wondering why I
have suddenly stopped blogging or an existing reader wondering I am
peppering your RSS feed with antiquated articles from yesteryear, I
apologise.</p>

<p>If I was embarking on the migration again, I would probably spend a
little more time checking the migrated content prior to trimumphantly
making the switch. However, when you have more then 750 posts and 1100
comments, that&#8217;s easier said than done.</p>

<p>A useful tip to speed up the import process is to purge all comment spam
in WordPress prior to the import. Similarly, disabling the Habari
Pingback plugin also speeds up the import considerably.</p>

<p>Habari does not automatically ping Google of new content but Feedburner
has equivalent functionality.</p>

<p>Apart from fixing up a few posts containing locally hosted images, the
tedious administration tasks should now be complete so I can start to
enjoy the various features of Habari.</p>

<p>One example is the media silo with Flickr integration. On WordPress, I
often struggled with the seemingly simple task of inserting a photo into
a blog post. Initially, I thought I was just stupid but now I know why -
the interface was broken.</p>

<p>Owen Winkler created a
<a href="http://asymptomatic.net/2008/01/15/2688/this-is-how-media-should-be-done-habari-style">screencast</a>
demonstrating the features of the Habari media silo with easy management
of locally stored images as well as seamless integration into media
services (Flickr, Viddler).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I simply couldn&#8217;t resist the temptation any longer so this blog is now
running on <a href="http://habariproject.org/en/">Habari</a> because:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Habari Administration screens look like they have been designed
rather than evolved.</li>
<li>The WordPress import utility works brilliantly.\</li>
<li>Michael C. <a href="http://www.twofishcreative.com/michael/blog/">Harris</a>
created a TinyMCE
<a href="http://www.twofishcreative.com/michael/blog/2008/02/04/tinymce-habari-plugin-reaches-0-2-in-record-time">plugin</a>
for Habari - literally minutes after my initial enquiry.\</li>
<li>Most of the required functionality (Google Analytics, Feedburner,
Akismet, Sitemap) is available as
<a href="http://wiki.habariproject.org/en/Available_Plugins">plugins</a> for
Habari.</li>
<li>Michael Harris also helped me configure rewrite rules so my existing
WordPress permalink structure is retained.</li>
<li>A gentleman called <a href="http://codeb.us/">Harry</a> from London developed
this attractive Habari <a href="http://codeb.us/redarry-theme">theme</a>.</li>

<p>I used to really enjoy Kington&#8217;s columns in The Independent. There

<p>Another of my favourite journalists is Giles Smith of The Times. Last

unfairly.&#8217;</p>

<p><a href="http://football.guardian.co.uk/News_Story/0,,2254603,00.html">Quote</a>
from Richard Scudamore (Chief Executive Premier League)</p>

<p>The proposal is for an additional competitive Premier League fixture to
be played around the world. Although the top 5 clubs will be seeded,
this still allows for the possibility of United drawing Derby at home
(in Beijing) while Arsenal visit Liverpool (in Los Angeles).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last night, I took Norman Junior III to visit the new, improved Wembley
stadium last night to see England play Switzerland in a friendly.</p>

<p>After paying homage to Sherlock Holmes, we changed at a packed Baker
Street for the fast Metropolitan line to Wembley Park. We stood on the
platform as one train departed and I was just contemplating whether we
should &#8216;go for it&#8217; when the next train arrived or step aside and wait
for the next one.</p>

<p>A well dressed lady was complaining to a London Transport official:
&#8216;Listen - I&#8217;ve been here for 25 minutes and I just can&#8217;t get on any
train.&#8217; &#8216;Well I&#8217;m awfully sorry madam but we currently have 90,000
football fans going to Wembley.&#8217; &#8216;I can see that but I do need to get
home. It&#8217;s an absolute disgrace. What about all the ordinary people ?&#8217;</p>

<p>Thankfully, my dithering indecision was abruptly removed by the late
arrival of some shaven headed Ing-er-land fans who charged up the steps,
ran towards the closing doors and whisked us both up and onto the
underground train into a packed carriage. Well, to be fair it was
positively spacious compared with the Waterloo &amp; City line on a weekday
morning.</p>

<p>Three Swiss lads were then subjected to a deep probing English
inquisition from curious Ing-er-land fans.</p>

<p>&#8216;Hey mate, what language do you speak then ?&#8217; &#8216;In Switzerland, we speak
Swiss-German.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Hey mate, what&#8217;s the capital of Switzerland then ?&#8217; &#8216;Zurich&#8217;</p>

<p>A brief lull and respite for the Swiss visitors before a final burst of
alcohol fuelled inspiration:</p>

<p>&#8216;Hey mate, can you sort a bank account out for me ?&#8217;</p>

<p>Cue uproarious laughter all round - well from those passengers who were
able to move their ribcages.</p>

<p>Walked down Wembley Way watching day trippers taking photos and entered
the stadium. Wondered what qualifications are needed to be an &#8216;Escalator
Steward&#8217; and took our seats high up in the South stand with an excellent
view.</p>

<p>Much to my surprise, the minute&#8217;s silence for Munich was observed by the
vast majority of supporters.</p>

<p>England appeared in yet another away kit (available from all good sports
outfitters in March). The decision to play in the away strip for a home
fixture was puzzling but it transpired that Capello ordered this after
hearing that Ashley Cole &#8216;preferred playing away&#8217;.</p>

<p>At least, we were both cheering a team in Red with Rooney, Ferdinand and
Brown (or rather Wes Orange). The game got underway, Brown endured a
nightmare opening 45 minutes and Matthew Upson is undoubtedly the most
one-footed player ever to don an England shirt.</p>

<p>Switzerland were neat and tidy and comfortable on the ball without
really threatening the goal.</p>

<p>England were playing 4-1-4-1 and looked nervous. For the first 40
minutes I don&#8217;t think I have seen so many sideways and backwards passes
since Ray Wilkins played for United.</p>

<p>While I didn&#8217;t hear any booing, there was the occasional Beckham chant
and increasing unrest in the unpadded seats as half-time approached.</p>

<p>Suddenly, unexpectedly, something happened - Joe Cole remembered he was
an attacker, took a defender on and Jermaine Jenas gratefully scored the
first goal under Fabio Capello&#8217;s regime.</p>

<p>After an overpriced drink, we were staggered to head the announcer
proclaim &#8216;Please welcome the teams back for the second half - Here they
are, protecting their 1-0 lead - England !&#8217; The Italian influence
already seems to be pervasive.</p>

<p>The second half improved markedly until the Swiss had the temerity to
score with a well taken goal. The Swiss contingent rang their cow-bells
and chanted &#8216;La Suisse&#8217;. Ing-er-land fans responded with &#8216;We know you
speak Swiss-German and Zurich is your capital city.&#8217;</p>

<p>The hard working England captain, Stevie Gerrrraaaarrrrd, got to the
dead ball line and crossed for substitute Sean Wright-Phillips for
another tap-in.</p>

<p>Peter Crouch came on, Cashley Cole went off to a solitary shout of
&#8216;Where&#8217;s your Cheryl gone ?&#8217; and Wayne Rooney dropped a little deeper.
In fact, he was so deep he was playing at left back, conceding corners
and passing balls down the line to Wayne Bridge.</p>

<p>England continued to press for another goal and an otherwise impressive
David James made his inevitable token error, flapping at a high cross.</p>

<p>Die hard, loyal fans who apparently are &#8216;Ing-er-land till I die&#8217; decided
to avoid the queues at Wembley Park and streamed out of the stadium.
When the full-time whistle blew, the stadium was half-full. Part time
supporters.</p>

<p>The game ended 2-1 for England. The remaining Ing-er-land fans were
happy and we started the long journey home via Wembley Central herded
together like cattle on the station approach with a &pound;6 program for
company.</p>
