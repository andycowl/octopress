  <div class="entry-content"><p>Apologies for the brief radio silence.</p>

<p>I was shocked and alarmed by this
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/6059726.stm">news</a> on
Wednesday so I have been busy purging my blog of all contentious,
provocative, controversial articles and erasing every last trace of my
true identity (which is Norman Brightside, 23 Baker Street, London) to
an amusing pseudonym that can never, ever be traced (even by clever
people from Essex). I have also taken the sensible precaution of moving
house and going X-directory.</p>

<p>I was living in fear of a madman or worse, a Manchester City fan,
arriving on my doorstep brandishing a machete after taking offence to
this blog. I must admit the teenager selling dusters looked a little
startled when I opened the door armed with a shotgun.</p>

<p>Now my identity is once again safe, normal service will now be resumed.</p>

<p>The best bit about the whole story - the culprit
<a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,200-2408429,00.html">bragged</a>
about the attack back in the original chat room. The stupidity of some
people never ceases to amaze me.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Arsene Wenger is
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/6050848.stm">bleating</a>
about a referee who &#8216;doesn&#8217;t see things that exist&#8217;. This is the
ultimate irony from a man who, after 10 years, still constantly fails to
see things that do exist on a football pitch.</p>

<p>Thierry <a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/05/18/priceless/">Henry</a>
is a superb footballer but should similarly be discouraged from giving
post-match interviews after a defeat. His moaning, whinging performance
almost rivalled his self-pitying rant following his dismal showing in
the European Cup Final.</p>

<p>Both men remind me of the junior football league my son plays in every
Saturday. Apart from the fact, those lads accept defeat with a good deal
more grace and dignity.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today I have accepted a new and challenging position after a series of
gruelling, demanding interviews and in depth technical tests. My new
role is working for Dreamhost as a BMC Patrol Monitor Agent.</p>

<p>My key responsibilities are as follows:</p>

<p>Write a blog article offline using Performancing.
Post draft.
Preview article in WYSIWG format on the blog.
Blog is slow and unresponsive.
ssh to Dreamhost server which is slow and unresponsive.
Run &#8216;w&#8217; to determine load average which is slow and unresponsive.
Raise ticket with Dreamhost technical support.
Wait for a period of time.
The performance problem is &#8216;resolved&#8217;. Perm any one from:
1.  &#8216;Denial of Service attack&#8217; - now resolved by firewall configuration
2.  &#8216;Users in breach of Terms of Service - accounts now cancelled
3.  &#8216;Users producing abnormal heavy load&#8217; - now migrated to another</p>

<pre><code>server
</code></pre>

<ol>
<li>Machine was recently rebooted that should solve problem</li>
</ol>


<p>Repeat whole pointless exercise the next time. Repeat ad infinitum.</p>

<p>So anyone with any recommendations for a reliable hosting provider
capable of hosting a low bandwidth personal WordPress blog, please make
themselves known.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m really starting to regret leaving the warm, cozy, uncomplicated
world of hosted WordPress.com.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There is nothing worse than a blog entry titled &#8216;Dear Diary&#8217; - hence the
title - but this is my humble submission for &#8217;<a href="http://www.historymatters.org.uk/output/page96.asp">One Day in
layout: post
comments: true
History</a>&#8217; so please
forgive me. Of course, I could author this piece directly on the site
but that would mean checking I am within the 650 word limit which is far
too much work (unless I use Microsoft Word).</p>

<p>Get up at 7am and unload dishwasher. My one and only household chore but
one I perform very well. Breakfast of cereal, tea and orange juice.</p>

<p>Quick scan of work email to see if anything needs my attention. Today I
am going to be onsite with a customer and unlikely to have access to
email.</p>

<p>Quick scan of
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/05/25/good-vibes-from-netvibes/">Netvibes</a>.
The only thing to interest me is the recent update to
<a href="http://blog.tailrank.com/2006/10/tailrank_20_is_.html">TailRank</a>. I
have occasionally played with various meme trackers
(<a href="http://techmeme.com/">TechMeme</a>, <a href="http://digg.com/">Digg</a>,
<a href="http://reddit.com/">Reddit</a>, <a href="http://populicio.us/">populicio.us</a>) but
usually my feeds contain the same stories of interest. I also like
<a href="http://popurls.com/">popurls</a> as a quick dashboard of current and
breaking news.</p>

<p>Today I am visiting a Siebel customer in Ascot. This location is
convenient for me (no hotels, no flights, no lengthy drive) and is a
shorter journey than to Oracle&#8217;s offices in Thames Valley Park.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s strange. For some reason, the traffic in Kingston upon Thames
isn&#8217;t completely gridlocked and I actually cross the bridge over the
River Thames in less than 20 minutes. Then I remember why. This week is
half-term for some local schools (my son is on holiday) but, much to his
glee and her chagrin, my daughter is still at school.</p>

<p>Drive through Sunningdale and marvel at the size of some of the houses
(mansions would be a better description) here. Although I keep hearing
that <a href="http://www.thedorsetpage.com/locations/place/S020.htm">Sandbanks</a>
in Dorset is the richest area in the UK, Sunningdale must run it a close
second.</p>

<p>Arrive at client offices. I am slightly early which is better than
slightly late so I make a quick call to an account manager with a
(&#8216;political not technical&#8217;) query from a customer about a review from
last week.</p>

<p>This customer has a serious data issue in production. On July 22 2006, a
&#8216;consultant&#8217; advised the customer to configure Siebel to use Universal
Time Co-ordinated (UTC). This proposal was a good idea (TM) but poorly
executed.</p>

<p>Key elements of the UTC migration were omitted (migration of
pre-existing non-UTC data, specification of timezones for each group of
users who are located around the world, modification of the database
timezone). Apart from that, the conversion to UTC went very well.</p>

<p>The net result was obtuse behaviour and incorrect appointment times
observed by different users. The issue is compounded by the fact that
this customer also has mobile Web clients who use Siebel on a
disconnected laptop and then synchronise with the server. In addition,
the Siebel administrator reports that server components (EIM, Workflow)
function but now report incorrect submit/start times.</p>

<p>Fortunately, Siebel has a conversion utility (documented in the Global
Deployment Guide) to address the issue so I spent some time configuring
and testing to fix the data quality issue for the various scenarios.</p>

<p>Get home. Eat tea. Settle down to watch United versus Copenhagen.
Discover that the wife is going out (how very inconsiderate) and I have
pop out to collect my daughter from trampolining.</p>

<p>Count words using Google <a href="http://docs.google.com">Docs</a> - 560.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Feedburner - WordPress.com provides users with
<a href="http://wordpress.com/blog/2006/04/14/feed-stats/">statistics</a> about
feed subscriptions. At best, these metrics were questionable and I used
to provide two RSS feeds (WordPress and Feedburner) so the metrics
didn&#8217;t capture all feed activity anyway. As there is no equivalent
functionality in WordPress 2.0.4 out of the box, I resurrected my
Feedburner account and installed this WordPress
<a href="http://orderedlist.com/wordpress-plugins/feedburner-plugin/">plugin</a>
which automatically routes any subscribers to the WordPress RSS feed
through <a href="http://www.feedburner.com/">Feedburner</a>.</p>

<p>Sitemap - I started from zero when I created this site so I could try my
hand at organic gardening. The only search engine I submitted to was
<a href="http://www.google.com/webmasters/">Google</a>. When I was trying to
encourage Google to index the new site, I discovered that a
<a href="http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?answer=40318&amp;query=sitemap&amp;topic=&amp;type=">sitemap</a>
could accelerate the process. This WordPress
<a href="http://www.arnebrachhold.de/2005/06/05/google-sitemaps-generator-v2-final">plugin</a>
generates a sitemap which tells the Google crawler about the site
structure and recently updated pages. The sitemap automatically gets
updated after each post and helps to reduce network traffic.</p>

<p>My lengthy list of extensions (or add-ons as they are now called) also

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I support England but I simply can not help laughing uncontrollably at
this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zE1JTvbpv1A&amp;eurl=">goal</a>. I wonder
what Steve Maclaren was jotting down:</p>

<ul>
<li>&#8216;Give David James a call when I get home&#8217;</li>
<li>&#8216;More backpassing practice tomorrow&#8217;</li>
<li>&#8216;Get lawn cut at weekend&#8217;</li>
<li>&#8216;Wonder if Gareth will have me back as assistant ?&#8217;</li>
</ul>


<p>Almost as amusing is the media backlash against Maclaren. Inevitably,
the honeymoon is over before it even started. Pity there is no-one
better to replace him.</p>

<p>Maybe, just maybe, England aren&#8217;t as good as we seem to think we are.</p>

&#8217;<a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/10/10/google-docs-spreadsheets-launches">Docs &amp;
Spreadsheets</a>&#8217;
which is an overhaul of the original Writely interface and integration
with Google Spreadsheets. I must admit I prefer the Google Docs
interface and was interested to see that Docs can still publish to a
blog (just like Writely).</p>

<p>The documentation suggests that tagging the article with keywords will
be mapped to matching blog categories and that the document title will
indeed be preserved in the blog entry. However, a simple test confirms
that neither of these two features work as advertised (on WordPress at
least). Sigh.</p>
