  <div class="entry-content"><p>Have a look at this <a href="http://www.paulstamatiou.com/">blog</a>. Lots of
interesting, varied material, frequently updated, nicely presented,
excellent use of images, easy to navigate, searchable, well structured
and very professional looking. All in all, an excellent blog.</p>

<p>This blog is by Paul Stamatiou, a 19 year old student. A few months ago,
I happened across this
<a href="http://www.paulstamatiou.com/2005/11/03/how-to-boost-your-blog-traffic/">article</a>
on Paul&#8217;s blog when I first started blogging but stupidly forgot to
bookmark it.</p>

<p>This is undoubtedly one of the best personal blogs I have seen. In fact,
I was so impressed I did as he
<a href="http://www.paulstamatiou.com/2006/01/04/just-a-favor/">suggested</a> and
nominated Paul&#8217;s blog for the &#8216;Best Teen Blog&#8217; award.</p>

<p>Paul is looking for a job this summer. Somehow, I don&#8217;t think he will
have any trouble getting fixed up.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Dear Cathy and Clare</p>

<p>I am increasingly worried about the size of my Inbox. I am almost
embarassed to admit this but it currently has 6,207 items dating from
way back September 2003 (and that doesn&#8217;t even include &#8216;Archived
Folders&#8217;). Tom Kyte (who I admire and respect greatly) likes to keep
everything in its place, spic and spotlessly span and currently has a
single item sitting in his
<a href="http://tkyte.blogspot.com/2006/01/nirvana-is.html">Inbox</a>. And his
finger is poised over the &#8216;Delete&#8217; button to expunge that one too !</p>

<p>A very organised chap, who knows all about GTD,
<a href="http://www.43folders.com/2006/01/04/email-dmz/">recommends</a> creating a
brand new shiny, empty folder called &#8216;DMZ&#8217; and moving all the 6,207
messages into there. Apparently, this single action will produce the
illusion of an empty Inbox, produce an enormous sense of well being and
contentment (well until the next email arrives in 12 seconds), help me
feel better about myself, shed two stones overnight, make friends and
influence people, lift a massive psychological burden from my shoulders,
help me to get things done, focus on the key objectives for 2006 and
finally get that long awaited promotion.</p>

<p>However, I am a little reluctant to trust someone masquerading under the
name of &#8216;43 Folders&#8217;. If he is so clever, why does he even need 43
folders and, more to the point, how many messages are in each one ?
Enquiring minds want to know. Also, simply dumping my beloved email
archives into a demilitarised zone would fill me with guilt. I would
hate to think of all those technical nuggets, match reports, humorous
anecdotes, sizable attachments, funny photos, jokes, customer
testimonials (I am sure there is one buried in there) and managerial
approvals that would be sitting unloved in the &#8216;DMZ&#8217; folder.</p>

<p>In my heart, I know that I really should put aside four days to review
all of those 6,207 messages and treat them appropriately. Most could be
deleted, some would merit moving into a dedicated folder, that one from
last summer about ergonomics in the workplace might look nice printed
out and pinned above my desk and a miniscule rump would be left to help
me get focussed on what is really important in my life and genuinely
needs to get done.</p>

<p>However, if I were to set the time aside doing this administrative task,
I simply wouldn&#8217;t be able to get anything done.</p>

<p>As Joseph Heller once said: &#8216;There was only one catch and that was catch
22&#8217;</p>

<p>Disorganised of London</p>

<p>PS. The count has now increased to 6,213</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Sometimes, your offspring know more then you do. For example, my son is
a wizard at dragging, resizing and cropping photographs in a Word
document. This is a seemingly simple task but can quite literally take
me hours and drive me to the edge of despair.</p>

<p>Occasionally, however, you know more than your offspring. For example,
my son had assembled a pile of CD&#8217;s and was searching for copies of the
same MP3 tracks on the Internet. I then showed him that it would be
easier and quicker simply to insert the CD into the computer and click
&#8216;Import CD&#8217;.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Oracle have released
<a href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/products/database/project_raptor/index.html">Raptor</a>
(a freely available GUI SQL query tool) which may be of interest to
those of you who use Toad or are frustrated with the terseness of the
SQL*Plus interface.</p>

<p>Raptor is primarily a cross platform, PL/SQL developer tool, written in
Java (60 MB download). The SQL output is a scrollable grid (like Toad)
and there is the standard schema browser, PL/SQL debugger, SQL pretty
printer, DDL generator and a graphical interface to explain plan for
query tuning.</p>

<p>All in all, a very promising release which fills a surprising (to me)
gap in Oracle&#8217;s range of database products.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>WordPress made some changes to the available
<a href="http://wordpress.com/blog/2005/12/24/fauna-and-regulus/">themes</a> just
before Christmas which I have only just noticed.</p>

<p>I particularly like the changes in <a href="http://www.binarymoon.co.uk/2005/12/regulus-20/">Regulus
2.0</a> by Ben Gillbanks
as you can now customise the theme a little. You can choose to have the
calendar displayed (Howard will be pleased), change the &#8216;Blogroll&#8217; to
use link categories, change the header image and the colour scheme.
Also, the irritating &#8216;Message essage&#8217; bug is fixed.</p>

not and they also listen to feedback.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Dear Jeff Bozos</p>

<p>It is 39 years and 7 months since my last confession.</p>

<p>Back in 2001, I opened an Amazon Associates account, placed a link to a
wonderful Oracle
<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201715848/203-5161126-0599122">book</a>
I wanted to buy on my personal Web site, clicked through on the link and
purchased the book from Amazon (UK). This abuse of the referral program
credited my newly opened Amazon Associates account with the princely sum
of 1.55 GBP.</p>

<p>I have never claimed the money which has subsequently sat dormant for
over 4 years in my Amazon Associates account. This was partly because I
was wracked and tormented by feelings of guilt. Even when I tried to
forget about my heinous crime, the Quarterly Associates Newsletter email
from Amazon kept reminding me of my sin.</p>

<p>Another reason was that the paltry amount was below the minimum required
by Amazon before you can actually withdraw the money.</p>

<p>I could have continued to abuse this system more fully to make even more
money (maybe even as much as a fiver) when I consider all the purchases
I have ever made from my favourite online retailer.</p>

<p>However, now is the time to reveal my secret and take my punishment like
a man.</p>

<p>Shamefully yours</p>

<p>Norman Brightside</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Doug Burns raises a surprising number of issues in a seemingly throwaway
comment about
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2005/12/20/the-killers-at-live-8/#comments">music</a>.</p>

<p>\1. I used to say I only have three passions in life &#8216;Music, Football
and Girls. The only thing that changes is the order.&#8217; :-)</p>

<p>\2. Stuff that is too personal to discuss in a blog. I am startled about
certain stuff I have seen posted in blogs. Personal stuff that I would
never dream of posting.</p>

<p>\3. Oracle versus Music verus Football. I started this blog after
lurking on the Oracle blog community for a while and intially thought I
would post occasional enlightening, technical articles which were met
with worldwide acclaim. After a while, I realised, those posts would be
few and far between.</p>

<p>The other Oracle bloggers cover that stuff far better than I ever could.
Also, I would make idiotic mistakes and have people correcting me all
the time. I think I can spend my time more profitably reading and
learning from others. To be honest, the technical niceties of PL/SQL
&#8216;bulk collect&#8217;, bind variables and 10046 trace analysis can be a little
dry when that is your day job. I probably care more and have more to say
about music, football (blogging, software etc).</p>

<p>\4. Another quandry about &#8217;<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2005/11/10/blog-etiquette/">blogging
etiquette</a>&#8217;.
I commented on Howard Rogers&#8217;
<a href="http://dizwell.com/blog/2005/12/17/zeitgeist-or-coincidence/">view</a> on
the importance of calendar functionality in a blog. He answered my
questions fully and politely (but I still hold a contrary view). Now do
I take my followup to email or continue to comment on his blog article
when most people probably aren&#8217;t interested ?</p>

<p>\5. Indeed, should this lengthy post be a comment to Doug&#8217;s comment, a
private email to Doug or a post in its own right ?</p>

<p>\6.
<a href="http://dizwell.com/blog/2005/12/17/zeitgeist-or-coincidence/#comment-297">Diction</a>.
When I read my own blog, I see long, rambling, interminable sentences.
This concerns me. Especially as I write a lot of technical reports as
part of my job for paying customers and I also play a major role in the
content of my kids&#8217; homework. I - sorry, my son - recently got a B+ for
a scintilliating project on San Francisco. I swear it should have been
an &#8216;A++&#8217;.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Old news is like yesterday&#8217;s papers. No-one is interested.</p>

<p>The chart of failed spammers is as good indicator of traffic to your
blog as any.</p>

<p>Old
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2005/12/19/a-brush-with-west-midlands-constabulary/">gems</a>
may totally get ignored depending on timing.</p>

<p>I might have one avid <a href="http://oracledoug.com/serendipity/">reader</a>.</p>

<p>Lots of people are looking for information about &#8216;Dixons Tax Free
Shopping&#8217;, &#8216;SonicStage 3.3&#8217; (are you listening, Sony ?) and, oddly
enough, &#8216;Paul Scholes + family&#8217;.</p>

<p>Google is a popular but sub-optimal search engine for blogs as monthly
archives may contain a wide variety of unrelated content (Roy Keane,
Antibes, Blog, Chameleons, DAB) which will ultimately confuse people and
waste time.</p>

<p>Not many people will comment. Even fewer will link.</p>
