  <div class="entry-content"><p>Two paltry efforts by yours truly to brighten up everyone&#8217;s morning in
the Brightside household.</p>

<p>\1. I decided to hoist my boxer shorts as high as humanly possible in
the style of <a href="http://www.borat.tv/ms_blog/cannes.jpg">Borat</a> (although,
disappointingly, mine are black not lime green). You can only imagine my
wife&#8217;s surprise and delight when she (finally) emerged from the bathroom
to be greeted by this unexpected and wonderful sight.</p>

<p>\2. Fifteen minutes later, following a dramatic and rapid
transformation, I have changed into an immaculate dark suit, freshly
pressed, crisp white shirt and an expensive Italian silk tie. I lurk
outside the lounge door humming the theme music from James Bond. The
volume reaches a explosive cresendo and is climaxed with &#8216;The Man With
The Golden Gun&#8217;.</p>

<p>I complete my preparations by carefully removing my weapon from the
black leather sheath and taking off the safety catch. I burst into
action and storm into the lounge announcing myself with the immortal
words &#8216;My name is Bond - James Bond&#8217;.</p>

<p>Then I unleash a burst of rapid fire from my gun to eliminate the three
intruders lurking at the bay window followed by a head-shot to eliminate
the heavily built Russian henchman, cunningly hidden under the ironing
board in the playroom.</p>

<p>I athletically dive to the ground and shoot down the expensive crystal
glass candelabra. I throw an impressive triple roll across the carpet to
avoid the falling glass. I stand up to reassure the petrified children
&#8216;Don&#8217;t worry. You are both safe now.&#8217; Finally, I demonstrate yet another
feature of my pump-action machine gun. I casually flick a switch and the
telescopic shaft extends, clicks and plumes into a black umbrella.</p>

<p>&#8216;Dad. Move. Your stupid umbrella is blocking the telly.&#8217;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The year end always sees lots of people post meaningless stats about
blog traffic. Unfortunately, I only have tracking data since my move to
Bluehost in late September but I am not going to let that stop me.
Google Analytics
<a href="http://flickr.com/photos/70276096@N00/347709488/">reports</a>:-</p>

<ul>
<li>4,709 visits</li>
<li>8,036 page views</li>
<li>1.71 pages per visit</li>
<li>3,902 unique visitors</li>
</ul>


<p>[ Note the almost linear growth in visitors over the three months. It
took me ages to get that perfect straight line ] Of course, these
traffic numbers are bitterly disappointing so, to cheer myself up, I
analyze the AwStats
<a href="http://flickr.com/photos/70276096@N00/347709491/in/photostream/">reports</a>
for the same period. This makes me feel much better.</p>

<ul>
<li>13,738 visits</li>
<li>54,266 page views</li>
<li>68,858 hits (even better !)</li>
<li>3.95 pages per visit</li>
<li>6,002 unique visitors</li>
</ul>


<p><a href="http://awstats.sourceforge.net/">AwStats</a> includes robots, spiders,
crawlers and spam automatons whereas Google Analytics only counts human
beings (and cats). Worse, Google
<a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/">Analytics</a> filters out my own visits
and referrals from the WordPress dashboard (which accounts for 97% of
traffic) ! Oh no. What&#8217;s this ? Feedburner are now
<a href="http://blogs.feedburner.com/feedburner/archives/2007/01/a_360_degree_view_of_audience_1.php">offering</a>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Occasionally, I have been tempted to experiment with Google
<a href="https://www.google.com/adsense/default?destination=/adsense/home">Adsense</a>
on this blog. Not because I think I will get rich and be able to retire
but I am curious to see how the technology works. Thankfully, to date,
laziness, inertia and minimalist tendencies have prevailed.</p>

<p>So I was very interested to read Guy Kawasaki&#8217;s 12 month
<a href="http://blog.guykawasaki.com/2007/01/a_review_of_my_.html">review</a> of
his popular <a href="http://blog.guykawasaki.com/">blog</a>. &#8216;How To Change The
World&#8217; received 2.5 million page views (slightly more than my humble
blog), 7,000 comments (again, slightly more than my statistics) and
2,000 trackbacks (1,999 more than me) in 2006.</p>

<p>For all this effort, I was staggered to learn that this blog, with 4,217
inbound links, 21,000 subscribers and which consistently features in the
Technorati <a href="http://technorati.com/pop/blogs/">Top 100</a>, earned Guy
Kawasaki the princely sum of $3,350.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My. How times change. In my day, the philosophy was simple:</p>

<ul>
<li>Always be sick in your own time.</li>
<li>Ensure a newspaper is safely cached behind the toilet cistern.</li>
<li>Arrive and leave the office 30 seconds before/after your manager.</li>
<li>Get an urgent pager alert whenever your round is imminent.</li>
<li>Be quick to claim credit and divert blame.</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I hereby pledge to carefully research every single customer I will be
visiting. This means talking to the account manager, reviewing
outstanding service requests and making a courtesy call to the technical
contact to confirm the arrangements and scope the work.</p>

<p>And most important of all, check that there is no &#8216;Bring Your Kids To
Work Day&#8217; planned in the near future.</p>

<p>Friday 22 December 2006 should have been a quiet day for me. A time to
submit the final timesheet and send off expenses before the end of the
year. A time to clear out the Inbox and adjourn to sing carols around
the Christmas Tree.</p>

<p>But no, on the last working day before Christmas, I was summoned to a
client who desperately wanted someone on-site to look into some odd
performance problems.</p>

<p>As I walked through reception, I noted an unusually high number of
children running around, playing &#8216;It&#8217; in the corporate restaurant. As I
walked up the stairs, my host kindly picked a red sticker off the back
of my jacket. &#8216;Oh, a young lad stuck this on you downstairs.&#8217;</p>

<p>We get a coffee and settle down to some detailed analysis of sluggish
performance and obtuse behaviour. Or rather, we try to but our
concentration is interrupted by a screaming baby. I look across the
office to see a lady sitting alone at a desk, typing with a very
unhappy, red faced baby sitting in a buggy alongside.</p>

<p>I recognise the symptoms. This baby is inconsolable. This baby is
telling his mummy that he is not really enjoying this unexpected and
unwelcome change to his environment. This baby is past the point of no
return. This baby is screaming its lungs out and will be for another 10
minutes.</p>

<p>My host must be psychic as he senses my irritation and sheepishly
confesses: &#8216;Today Is Bring Your Children To Work Day and all employees
are encouraged to bring their children in to the office.&#8217;</p>

<p>I reply &#8216;Oh what a lovely idea. I truly wish my company introduce this
idea next year so my children can come and see me in my office
environment.&#8217; while thinking &#8216;Oh what an absolutely ridiculous idea.
What complete idiot dreamed this one up.&#8217;</p>

<p>In actual fact, my children did come to visit my offices once (to reduce
a long car journey somewhere). They were simply awestruck as I walked
them down a corridor past bays of people typing on keyboards and staring
at computer screens. They stole curious glances at name tags and
paraphernalia (photos, jokes, mascots) on people&#8217;s cubes. They looked,
with fascination, at sales guys closing important business deals on the
telephone.</p>

<p>Then we arrived at my desk which had a computer, keyboard and monitor.
No name tag. No photos of them dressed as reindeers pulling funny faces.
No office witticisms. No &#8216;Beyond the Expected&#8217; award. No post-its. No
motivational posters. No photos of my wife. No photos of Norman
Whiteside. Nothing.</p>

<p>&#8216;Is this it ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Err, well yes&#8217;.</p>

<p>&#8216;So this is where you work ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Well, err, yes&#8217;.</p>

<p>&#8216;But it&#8217;s just like your computer at home.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Well yes I know.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;So what do you actually do here ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Well, I type on this keyboard and look at this monitor. Oh and
sometimes I think.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;So why do you have to come here to work ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Well sometimes I have important meetings and sometimes I have to talk
to people.&#8217; (gesturing around to all my colleagues who are heads down
desperately praying I will go away).</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh and I have a telephone - look&#8217;.</p>

<p>&#8216;But it&#8217;s just a telephone. Dad. I&#8217;m bored.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Well I do have this pedestal with a couple of books and a booklet
describing the corporate values&#8230;&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Dad - this is so boring. Can we go now ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Look kids - come on. You haven&#8217;t seen the photocopier and the kitchen
yet.&#8217;</p>

<p>We walk up the corridor and I was praying for someone to acknowledge me,
ask me a question, rib me about the football. But nothing. Complete
silence.</p>

<p>&#8216;Look Norma. Here is the photocopier where I copy my expense receipts.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Dad - come on. Let&#8217;s go.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;But look Norman. We can&#8217;t go without seeing the coffee machine and the
sports and social club notice board.&#8217;</p>

<p>So, if Human Resources suggest a &#8216;Bring your kids to work day&#8217; on May
22, don&#8217;t think that is a lovely idea. It isn&#8217;t.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Cousin John called with best wishes for the New Year and just wanted to
mention the Billy Connolly double CD. He was absolutely delighted with
this thoughtful gift and was looking forward immensely to listening to
it in the car.</p>

<p>I graciously accepted his thanks and reciprocated by thanking him for my
M&amp;S Men&#8217;s Grooming Set complete with black leather carry case. I assured
him that when we next meet, my nasal hair will be trimmed, my bushy
eyebrows will no longer meet in the middle and my ears will be
fluff-free.</p>

<p>Then he went and spoiled it by claiming &#8216;Just one small problem, Norman.
There were no actual CD&#8217;s inside the case.&#8217; He kindly offered to send
the empty case back so once again, I am condemned to make the trek into
town, fighting with all the bargain hunters, to stand in a refund queue
that spans 0.8 miles and requires external (armed) security guards to
police.</p>

<p>As an interim measure, I asked him whether he could just enjoy the liner
notes and look at the photographs until I manage to resolve the problem.</p>

<p>Norma was horrified. She immediately asked me to call Uncle Robert
(lucky recipient of Tony Hancock&#8217;s Half Hour audio CD). Unfortunately,
Uncle Robert also ripped off the wrapping and expectantly opened the CD
only to find an empty jewel case with a mysterious note attached: &#8216;More
in cupboard.&#8217;. He duly went to the cupboard but didn&#8217;t find any CD&#8217;s.</p>

<p>I told him this CD captured Hancock&#8217;s greatest and most surreal work;
the ultimate in silent comedy rather than a sick joke by us.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Regularly refreshing Oracle statistics on all tables, indexes and column
histograms flushes the shared pool and can occasionally lead to some
unexpected and unpleasant surprises.</p>

<p>Thankfully, Oracle 10g automatically maintains 31 days of statistics
history which means it is trivial to revert to a previous set in order
to restore service to the production environment while you investigate
