  <div class="entry-content"><p>No-one ever asks me: &#8216;Hey Norman, why don&#8217;t you have a blogroll with 457
interesting, thought provoking sites for me to look at ?&#8217;.</p>

<p>Firstly, while I find the reading lists of others interesting and a
useful means of discovering new sources, I don&#8217;t particularly want an
lengthy blogroll adding yet more clutter to my (sort of) minimalist
blog.</p>

<p>Secondly, my RSS reading lists are stored on a
<a href="http://www.netvibes.com/">Netvibes</a> server. I have separate tabs for
&#8216;Oracle&#8217;, &#8216;WordPress&#8217;, &#8216;Sport&#8217;, &#8216;News&#8217;, &#8216;Blogs&#8217;, &#8216;Tech&#8217;, &#8216;Software&#8217; and
a small one called
&#8217;<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/08/08/the-state-of-the-uk-blogosphere/">UK</a>&#8217;.
I would love to be able to publish these tabs and share the contents
with everyone.</p>

<p>Ideally, I would like to publish all my Netvibes tabs somewhere which
would always reflect my subscriptions. This would ensure that the lists
are always up to date and reflect my <strong>current</strong> reading list so
transient blogs (like World Cup 2006) and dead blogs would be removed.</p>

<p>Netvibes has a <a href="http://eco.netvibes.com/">ecosystem</a> for sharing
resources but I am not quite sure whether this does precisely what I
want. If I wasn&#8217;t so lazy, I might investigate further.</p>

<p>One thing I like about <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/">Bloglines</a> is the
tight and seamless integration of the &#8216;My Feeds&#8217; reading list with the
Bloglines blog. The blogroll on the Bloglines blog is always
synchronised with the Bloglines reading list. Automatically. No need to
think about it. No need to export your OPML and upload it (again).
Bloglines manages this for you. OK - it was the only thing I liked about
my Bloglines <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/blog/andycowl">blog</a> but still.</p>

<p>This is exactly how it should be and what <a href="http://share.opml.org/">Share Your
OPML</a> is sadly lacking. Share Your OPML has some
promising features for popular and common feeds, feed discovery,
recommendations and match
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/06/02/blind-date/">making</a>.
However, while I can
<a href="http://share.opml.org/viewsharedfeeds/?user_id=3948">share</a> my feeds on
Share Your OPML, this is merely a static, outdated list.</p>

<p>The onus is on me to remember to do something i.e. export my reading
list from my current RSS reader and upload a modified OPML file at
recurring, regular intervals.</p>

<p>This is a lot of tedious work for me to do. Computers are much better at
this sort of stuff than humans. We are in 2006 and using Web 2.0 after
all. Finally, please remember that I am very, very
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/01/27/unix-for-lazy-people/">lazy</a>.</p>

<p>So, that&#8217;s why I don&#8217;t have a blogroll.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It really is in a right old state. I have a
<a href="http://www.netvibes.com/">Netvibes</a> tab called &#8216;UK&#8217;. It has a solitary,
uninspiring, dry news feed from the
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/default.stm">BBC</a>.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong. I enjoy a lot of blogs from UK authors. Some are
(<a href="http://oracledoug.com/serendipity/">Scottish</a>) technical types in the
<a href="http://rittman.net/">Oracle</a>
<a href="http://pjsrandom.wordpress.com/">blogging</a> community with a sense of
<a href="http://oraclesponge.wordpress.com/">humour</a> while others are Brits who
have <a href="http://andrewsherman.blogspot.com/">moved</a> to foreign shores or
very talented and dedicated <a href="http://www.tamba2.org.uk/T2/">WordPress</a>
<a href="http://ocaoimh.ie/">techies</a>.</p>

<p>Clearly, this is highly unsatisfactory and slightly underwhelming. I am
certain there must be a wealth of witty, interesting, fascinating blogs
out there written by <a href="http://www.britblog.com/">British</a> people but I
just can&#8217;t find them.</p>

<p>So - come on - where are you all hiding ?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The &#8217;<a href="http://www.metro.co.uk/">Metro</a>&#8217; is a free, lightweight,
disposable newspaper, aimed at commuters, which is solely funded by
advertising revenues. So lightweight, you can finish it by the time you
reach Waterloo but at least it saves you the embarrassment of staring at
your neighbour for 27 minutes.</p>

<p>Last month, The Metro reported the exciting
<a href="http://www.metro.co.uk/home/article.html?in_article_id=17723&amp;in_page_id=1">news</a>
that a quarter of all UK internet users maintain a blog. Hurrah !</p>

<p>However, the veracity of this claim is immediately subverted by the
statement that &#8216;59% of bloggers choose to make it public.&#8217; So, this
implies that 41% of UK bloggers are blogging in private, by invitation
only, to friends and family or in complete isolation. I know the British
are reserved but that is simply ridiculous.</p>

<p>The article then goes on to claim &#8216;growing numbers of writers see
[blogs] &#8230; as a way to get their voice heard.&#8217; A little difficult to
get your voice heard if your blog is not even published on the internet.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t think this superb journalism coupled with the deep, considered
incisive analysis is going to challenge Dave Sifry&#8217;s &#8217;<a href="http://www.sifry.com/alerts/archives/2006_08.html">State of the
Blogosphere</a>&#8217;.</p>

<p>PS. Memo to self: Idea for <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/dragonsden/">Dragon&#8217;s
Den</a> - a decent portal for UK
bloggers.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After two months and two days, the music has stopped, the theme
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/06/02/rotation-policy/">rotation</a>
carousel has travelled full circle and finally come to a halt.</p>

<p>WordPress.com offers a total of 40 themes (37 when I started) and I have
experimented and laboriously captured screenshots of every single one.</p>

<p>I have tried out all the WP themes as they became available but it was
interesting to live with each theme for a day or so.</p>

<p>My personal favourites were:</p>

<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/70276096@N00/162240611/in/set-72157594157259315/">Andreas04</a>
- I don&#8217;t normally like three column themes but this was an notable
exception.
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/70276096@N00/188615063/in/set-72157594157259315/">Light</a>
- simple, effective theme. If only it was a little wider.</p>

<p><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/70276096@N00/261113070/">Regulus</a> - still
probably my favourite (just) which rather negates the point of the
whole pointless exercise. The header image clinches it. You never
forget your first love.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/70276096@N00/183160220/in/set-72157594157259315/">Rubric</a>
- great looking theme with focus on the text but I feel
<a href="http://lorelle.wordpress.com/">Lorelle</a> has made this theme her own.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/70276096@N00/206524350/in/set-72157594157259315/">Sandbox</a>
- a building block for DIY enthusiasts.
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/70276096@N00/202237366/in/set-72157594157259315/"></a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/70276096@N00/202237366/in/set-72157594157259315/">White As
Milk</a>
- clean, minimalist look but narrow text.</p></blockquote>

<p>And my hall of shame:</p>

<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/70276096@N00/163570474/in/set-72157594157259315/">Banana
Smoothie</a>
- not for everyone but undeniably very distinctive.
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/70276096@N00/170564221/in/set-72157594157259315/">Flower
Power</a>
- not sure why this theme only uses half the screen.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/70276096@N00/194227376/in/set-72157594157259315/">Sweet
Blossoms</a>
- too much colour, not enough screen.</p></blockquote>

<p>I guess my perfect theme would be a two column, minimalist theme with an
emphasis on the article text. In fact, Scott&#8217;s Wallick&#8217;s
<a href="http://www.plaintxt.org/themes/veryplaintxt/">plaintxt</a> theme is pretty
close to perfection.</p>

<p>I guess I always could shell out 15 USD and build it myself on WordPress
using the recently launched <a href="http://wordpress.com/blog/2006/08/04/custom-css/">custom
CSS</a>. Alternatively, I
could just pay up and get my own hosted WordPress blog with complete
control over everything.</p>

<p>So, review the Flickr
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/70276096@N00/sets/72157594157259315/">set</a>
and cast your vote now.</p>

<p>RSS readers - don&#8217;t sneer from the sidelines but tell us all what RSS
reader you use and why.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Norman Brightside, a little known UK blogger from the London (near
England), was reeling yesterday from a cataclysmic, violent (yet
unwanted) backlash of media inspired attention from Web 2.0 types in
response to the impromptu and inadvertent release of 1367 GB of search
data (including IP addresses, referrer data, explicit search terms and
agent identifiers) from the Web server farm that hosts his incredibly
popular blog.</p>

<p>Brightside is an IT genius who had developed his Web server tracking
technology using advanced AI techniques to include the screen name of
the AOL user, the room they were actually surfing from, what they were
actually thinking, the strength of each individual key press together
with the facial expression used when typing in search terms.</p>

<p>Data Mining analysts have been busily crunching the data continuously
for 37 hours using Oracle Mega-Grid technology and a bank of powerful
Cray Supercomputers. Details have been forwarded to Interpol and, in a
curious twist, Blackburn Football Club, who are now being linked with
Ashley Cole.</p>

<p>Norman&#8217;s mum, Norma Jean was distraught:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;Oh I can&#8217;t believe our stupid son, Norman, has brought shame,
embarassment and pestilence upon the Brightside family name. I knew he
had a blog but how could he have been so stupid ?&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>Although the data was de-personalised, analysts predicted that simple
business intelligence and sophisticated cryptography techniques (1=&#8217;A&#8217;,
2=&#8217;B&#8217; etc) would quickly reveal the end user issuing each individual
search query, who could then be subject to prosecution, hanging and the
immediate loss of his Telewest subscription.</p>

<p>Norman Brightside has gone into hiding and withdrawn the data sets from
all public Web sites. He issued the following short press release from
The Priory Clinic, London.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;I&#8217;m really, really sorry. I don&#8217;t know what came over me. I simply
didn&#8217;t think my blog had that much traffic. I think there must be a
problem with the WordPress statistics which seem to be
under-reporting. My only defence is that my error might have been
caused by the excessive
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/08/07/hotel-inspector/">heat</a> in
my hotel room. I have carefully backed up and deleted all the data
now.&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>However, high bandwidth mirror sites, located all around the world, are
thought to still contain multiple copies of the full, unadulterated
search data.</p>

<p>And finally, if you don&#8217;t want to risk imprisonment, death or a call
from the NSA, here is that earth shattering search data published in
full.</p>

<blockquote><p>65.214.44.29 - - [07/Aug/2006:01:20:17 +0100] &#8220;GET /blog/ HTTP/1.1&#8221;

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The scheduling goddess has granted me a second successive week in
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/07/31/wheels-on-fire/">Birmingham</a>;
West Bromwich to be precise. I was shocked to discover that, following
my unfavourable
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2005/12/21/hostelries-in-west-bromwich/">review</a>
last December, the Days Inn Hotel has subsequently been taken over by
the budget chain, Premier Travel Inn.</p>

<p>My greeting at reception wasn&#8217;t too promising: &#8216;Ah - Good evening Mr.
Brightside. A double smoking room, I believe&#8217;. &#8216;Err no. I booked a
single, non-smoking room if you have one please.&#8217;</p>

<p>I entered my room which was very hot, in fact, it was &#8216;smoking&#8217;. The
&#8216;Info&#8217; button on the thermostat revealed the temperature was a stifling
29.5&#8217;C.</p>

<p>I went to open the windows but they were sealed. I went to turn down the
thermostat - to a more reasonable 18&#8217;C. Ah - that&#8217;s better. Just unpack
and wait for the room to cool down.</p>

<p>Then, unusually for me, I read the small print in the fine manual.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;Set room temperature with &#8216;Up&#8217; and &#8216;Down&#8217; buttons. This controls the
heater operation but cannot cool the room.&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>I think it&#8217;s time to see what price, and temperature, the Boddingtons is
served at.</p>

<a href="http://www.plaintxt.org/">plaintxt.org</a> are absolutely superb.</p>

<p>Clean, white, minimalist, striking, understated and refreshingly
different from the thousands of themes out there.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am interested in IT, technology and gadgets. Not obsessed but
interested and curious.</p>

<p>Recently, I find colleagues making increasing use of technology in the
workplace to try to help distributed teams to communicate more
effectively. Or maybe they&#8217;re just geeks who are afraid to pick up a
telephone.</p>

<p>People use Web conferencing to share desktops.</p>

<p>This is an excellent use of technology. For example, I recently tried to
help a customer in Copenhagen by remotely accessing the servers over the
network from my
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/08/03/word-of-caution-2/"><del>kitchen</del></a>
fully equipped home office. The speed was slightly sluggish and the
experience was a little frustrating at times but certainly much better
than laboriously dictating (&#8216;l&#8217; &#8216;s&#8217; &#8216;space&#8217; &#8216;slash&#8217; &#8216;t&#8217; &#8216;m&#8217; &#8216;p&#8217;) over
the phone or getting on a plane.</p>

<p>I have also used Web conferencing using VOIP which was fantastic as it
freed up the fingers to do the actual typing as well as pleasing the
financial director.</p>

<p>People also use chat conferencing either instead of, or curiously in
conjunction with, the ubiquitous (and much loved) telephone conference
calls. I am always a little nervous here in case I direct the wrong
words to the wrong person, particularly with my sense of &#8216;humour&#8217;.</p>

<p>People also have a increasing tendency to use instant messaging rather
than email to communicate internally.</p>

<p>This last development is the one I am slightly uncomfortable with for
reasons I find it hard to articulate but I&#8217;ll try:</p>

<ul>
<li>The opening line &#8216;Hi&#8217;, &#8216;Hello&#8217; or &#8216;Are you busy ?&#8217;. It&#8217;s like a
blind date. What do you say without sounding idiotic ?</li>
<li>Sometimes, if you are busy, this interruption and context switch can
be unwelcome. Setting your status to &#8216;Busy&#8217; doesn&#8217;t always work.</li>
<li>The person initiating the conversation normally wants something. It
is easier to ignore or defer an email. I find it impossible to
ignore an IM indefinitely.</li>
<li>Sometimes the conversation is so long winded and interactive, a
simple phone call would have been 10 times more effective and
quicker. Waiting on tenterhooks, with baited breath, in suspense
watching &#8216;Alan is typing&#8230;&#8217; for 2 minutes.</li>
<li>The termination of the &#8216;conversation&#8217; isn&#8217;t always clear. Have we
finished ? Is the dialogue over ? Are they still thinking ? Or are
they waiting for you to respond ? Can I close your IM window yet ?</li>
<li>And finally, the real reason, I suspect - using Instant Messaging
conjures up images of angst ridden, spotty teenagers messaging away
in txt speak together. You feel slight soiled by the experience. In
fact, I am sorely tempted to address #5 by signing off &#8216;C U L8R,
M8!&#8217;</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Take my advice. Never buy
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/01/25/credit-card-security/">flowers</a>
for your wife.
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/07/18/out-of-sight/">Ever</a>.</p>

<p>I am working at home, trying to finish a report. I don&#8217;t have a home
office so I work on the kitchen table.</p>

<p>For the last couple of days, two things have been slowly nagging away at
me like a dripping tap.</p>

<p>My wireless mouse sometimes loses the will to carry on working at such a
frantic pace. It squeakily demands a cup of coffee or just half an hour
of &#8216;Richard and Judy&#8217;. I stoutly refuse so the mouse pointer slowly
descends vertically down the screen which is fairly irritating and
virus-like.</p>

<p>So I took the poorly rodent for a &#8216;Well-Mouse Executive Health Check&#8217;
and the vet insisted that the mouse is in perfect health and the battery
level is &#8216;High&#8217;. I changed the battery anyway to no avail so now we have
to adjourn for &#8216;Richard and Judy&#8217; with a coffee every morning. After
that, the mouse works fine.</p>

<p>Secondly, there was a horrible, persistent odour disturbing my
concentration. I opened the windows. I opened the doors. I even had a
shower and used deodorant. Eventually, I capitulated and cleaned the
downstairs toliet. But the lingering smell stubbornly persisted.</p>

<p>Finally, I gave in, summoned my daughter and cleaned the
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/03/21/a-narrow-escape/">gerbil</a>
out. The full works. Clean water, new sawdust, change of food, full
steam valet and high pressure jet wash on the windows.</p>

<p>Phew - that&#8217;s better. Sit down to check my email&#8230;</p>

<p>God - what is that damned smell ?</p>

<p>And then it struck me. Right under my nose (literally) for the past few
days. A vase of (dead) flowers sitting in smelly, stagnant water.</p>

<p>So, next time, beautiful, colourful, fragrant flowers appear on the
kitchen table and it turns out Julia brought them when she came round
for coffee, don&#8217;t say &#8216;Oh - how lovely, darling&#8217; but &#8216;Just make sure you
chuck them out when they&#8217;re dead.&#8217;</p>
