  <div class="entry-content"><p>You can save lots of time and get even more things done by checking in
online for your flight at
<a href="http://www.britishairways.com/">www.britishairways.com</a>.</p>

<p>You can even change your allocated seat (sometimes) which is useful as
BA will always allocate an aisle seat if your preference is window and
vice-versa. Version 2.0 of the BA site (June 2006) will even include a
brief description of your prospective neighbour in order to help you
with this difficult choice.</p>

<p>You can also print out your boarding card on your 12 year old dot matrix
printer. This means you can skip the short queue at the BA self service
kiosks and immediately proceed to the lengthy queue for the curiously
misnamed &#8216;Fast Bag Drop&#8217;.</p>

<p>However, a word of caution to all you GTD&#8217;ers. Wait for the printout to
fully emerge and carefully check the output before leaving the BA web
site. Secondly, always, always click the &#8216;Click here to print boarding
card&#8217; icon to avoid potential embarassment.</p>

<p>Do not be tempted to think that because you work in IT, you know better
and it will be far quicker to simply right-click &#8216;Print This Page&#8217; to
save another 2.4 milliseconds in an effort to get things done.</p>

<p>Trust me. I did it and because I don&#8217;t know what a &#8216;frame&#8217; is, I found
myself presenting a rather unusual boarding pass at the British Airways
desk that simply said:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Click the &#8216;Print Boarding Pass&#8217; button (you idiot) to print&#8221;</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>People never ask me &#8216;Just who is this Norman Brightside character ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Norman Brightside&#8217; is an alias for a fictitious Oracle Database
Administrator based in Solihull, near England. Norman briefly flirted
with celebrity, last year, when he had the temerity to
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2005/11/04/tom-kyte-makes-mistake-shock/">criticise</a>
Tom Kyte.</p>

<p>Norman Brightside is also a bastardisation of Norman Whiteside, a
Northern Irish footballer who played for Manchester United in the 80&#8217;s
and the song &#8216;Mr. Brightside&#8217; by the popular American beat combo - The
Killers.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was recently without my laptop computer for a whole two hours.</p>

<p>I found the experience quite liberating.</p>

<p>I cleared my drawers of three years&#8217; worth of accumulated clutter and
paperwork.</p>

<p>I was then able to sit down quietly and read a whole chapter of a book
(Jonathan Lewis&#8217; Practical Oracle 8i) on Oracle partitioning which has a
fantastic analogy with the Encyclopedia Britannica. This is very useful
because when non-technical people ask you about partitioning, this is
exactly the analogy you should use (as opposed to &#8216;buckets&#8217; and
&#8216;partition elimination&#8217;).</p>

<p>I then made a list with pen and paper of things to get done. Old
technology, admittedly.</p>

<p>I then called some people on the telephone and spoke to them.</p>

<p>Then, finally, I got bored and pestered my colleagues, begging on one
knee for just 5 minutes on their computer.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This morning at some unearthly hour, I found myself standing once again
in the queue to clear security at Heathrow Terminal 4. I was almost at
the X-ray machine when a member of staff approached me and invited me to
&#8216;volunteer&#8217; for a full body scan.</p>

<p>He took me behind some screens and for one moment I feared the BAA queue
monitors were going to exact their terrible revenge for my outspoken
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/01/13/queuing-theory-at-baa/">criticisms</a>
last week. However, he explained that the body scanner would take three
scans of my body, each of which would pass a small amount of radiation
through my body.</p>

<p>He added that people are exposed to such radiation when flying above
30,000 feet and the body scan would be equivalent to flying at this
height for just 2 minutes.</p>

<p>This was supposed to reassure me but only planted the question in my
mind: &#8216;Is it dangerous to fly non-stop 24 hours from London to Australia
?&#8217;</p>

<p>He then offered me the option to decline but said the alternative would
be a &#8216;full body search by <strong>hand</strong> over there&#8217; (pointing to an open
area).</p>

<p>Obviously I agreed so I then had to stand at two oblique angles with my
hands up and felt like a complete idiot from the hilarious TV program
&#8216;You&#8217;ve Been Framed&#8217; although, thankfully, I was hidden from the view of
curious members of the public behind the partitions.</p>

<p>He then gave me the all-clear to proceed and informed me that I had the
body of a 65 year old (which was a little depressing as I am only 42)
and was pregnant with triplets but I did manage to jump 4 places in the
queue as a reward.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Two years ago, my hard disk failed. Completely. This was excellent news
as my computer ran a lot faster after a clean installation of Windows XP
but bad news because I lost email, names and addresses, documents etc.</p>

<p>One thing on my to-do list was to investigate offline storage to backup
key data files to avoid a repetition. And, yes, this &#8216;Next Action&#8217; had
been on the to-do list for two years.</p>

<p>So now I am using the freeware edition of
<a href="http://www.2brightsparks.com/syncback/sbse-features.html">SyncBack</a> to
synchronise folders between my two PC&#8217;s at home and backup key files to
my FTP site. The FTP site is constrained to 30 MB but should be adequate
for now. Large files (photos) are burned to CD.</p>

<p>As I now use Thunderbird (not Outlook Express), my email folders are
simple, plain old fashioned text files that can be imported into any
(normal) email client anywhere.</p>

<p>SyncBack is really intuitive software, fast, well documented and highly
recommended.</p>

<p>Easy to find if you hold the map the right way up.</p>

<p>Stella - 4 Euro per pint. Lively pub. One big screen and several small

  <div class="entry-content"><p>On Wednesday, I found myself patiently waiting in a queue, talking with
a nice lady from Toronto, to get through airport security at Heathrow
Terminal 4. Nothing unusual there.</p>

<p>Although, for someone from London to exchange pleasantries with a
complete stranger is a little unusual (but she started it).</p>

<p>However, on this occasion, only two X-ray machines were in use so the
queue was a little longer than usual and slowly and relentlessly growing
in length.</p>

<p>A BAA lady was monitoring the queue and, from time to time, would open
up a barrier to allow economy pasengers to join the Fast Track queue
(much to the disgust of all the business
<a href="http://www,nbrightside.com/blog/2005/10/22/british-mentality/">people</a>
who had paid a premium specifically to clear the security checks
quicker, avoid mixing with economy passengers, as they are in such a
desperate hurry and are so important with their toy phones glued to
their ears). This action would get smiles and thanks from those invited
but would only provide a brief respite from the underlying problem.</p>

<p>The queue got longer. People got more disgruntled. One man walked to the
head of the queue, presumably because his flight was imminent. People
grumbled under their breath, in a very British way. The queue got
longer.</p>

<p>A couple of ladies decided to follow suit and boldly walked straight up
to the head of the queue. People actually dared to challenge them (they
must have been foreign tourists). The lady from BAA interjected and
politely requested that they rejoin the queue from whence they came.
They retorted &#8216;but the queue is big and we will miss our flight&#8217;. The
lady checked the boarding passes and told them that they had a full 45
minutes before the flight departed which that was plenty of time and
they reluctantly went back to a stream of quiet &#8216;Tut&#8217;s.</p>

<p>A man immediately behind me then said to the BAA lady &#8216;Some people just
think they&#8217;re better than everyone else&#8217;. At this stage, my wait was
almost over as I was nearly at the X-ray machine. However, I thought
this was a little unfair so I took a deep breath, summoned up the
courage and said to the BAA lady.</p>

<p>&#8216;The queue is so long that people are actually queuing out in the main
concourse. You really need to open up another gate. That is why people
are getting worried and trying to jump the queue&#8217;.</p>

<p>She genuinely look surprised as if I had told her that I believed in
aliens and replied &#8216;Are they really ?&#8217; [ queuing on the concourse ]. Not
sarcastically but in all honesty.</p>

<p>To my absolute amazement, she then walked the whole length of the queue,
beyond passport control and looked out to the concourse, as she slowly
absorbed the full extent of the queue.</p>

<p>She then returned and summoned two of the four BAA staff who were just
stood around, chatting about their Christmas presents, the state of Aunt
Agatha&#8217;s health, flicking through the newspaper, arguing over whose turn
it was to get the coffee, the weather and Chelsea&#8217;s domination of the
Premiership</p>

<p>Another X-ray scanner was opened. The queue started to reduce. People
were happy although no-one had the courtesy to start a spontaneous round
of applause for yours truly. I asked the lady from BAA for an
application form for a job as a &#8216;customer service assistant and senior
queue monitor&#8217;.</p>

<p>The two remaining green shirted BAA staff remained chatting, no doubt
discussing those January return to work blues and how difficult they
were finding it to get motivated for work in 2006.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A long time ago, there was a unique band called <a href="http://www.thechameleons.com/">The
Chameleons</a> who hailed from Middleton,
Manchester.</p>

<p>Like a lot of bands, The Chameleons made some records, built up a
dedicated following, played lots of gigs and then split up.</p>

<p>Like a lot of bands, The Chameleons reformed.</p>

<p>Like a lot of bands, The Chameleons made some more records, played some
more gigs and then split up (again).</p>

<p>However, unlike a lot of bands, the lead singer, Mark Burgess, once went
to a private individual&#8217;s house and played at their birthday
<a href="http://web.ukonline.co.uk/nutts/invincible/party.htm">party</a>.</p>

<p>Now, I don&#8217;t like to namedrop but I met Mark Burgess once. It was just
before a gig at The Garage in Highbury. I had a very brief chat about
his life in Hamburg, United&#8217;s prospects against Bayer Leverkeusen in the
semi, ticket sales and whether he could put me on the guest list.</p>

<p>Years before that, I also had an email exchange with him. I forget most
of the details but will always remember his response to my &#8216;God - it
really was you&#8217; which was &#8216;Please don&#8217;t call me God, plain Mark will
do&#8217;.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>A long journey starts with a single step&#8230;</p></blockquote>

<p>I was curious about applying the concepts and ideas behind GTD to try to
manage my time (both at home and at work) more efficiently so I read up
a little about GTD over the weekend and actually ordered a copy of Dave
Allen&#8217;s
<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0749922648/qid=1136828908/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl/202-0516357-3727021">book</a>
(having read snippets in a bookshop who were nice enough to give me a
nice leather armchair for my comfort).</p>

<p>I found a lot of good information and interesting ideas at <a href="http://www.43folders.com/">43
Folders</a> and
<a href="http://www.lifehacker.com/">Lifehacker</a>.</p>

<p>I then heeded the very advice I was slightly disparaging about in a
previous
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/01/05/not-getting-things-done/">article</a>
and moved absolutely everything (over 6,000 messages) from my fat,
bloated Inbox into a new DMZ folder.</p>

<p>I even spent some time trawling through the dusty, old, antique
messages. As I suspected, the vast majority were well past their sell-by
date and could be safely deleted immediately. Then I started to detect
patterns; if I didn&#8217;t recognise the author/subject, then it was pretty
likely that the complete thread was no longer relevant and could be
deleted. Similarly, some authors simply have nothing of interest to say
ever; mostly automatons but sometimes human. The DMZ folder was trimmed
to less than 400 messages and the whole exercise must have taken less
than two hours (and not four days).</p>

<p>Some authors send me valuable technical content (mixed with some dross)
so their messages had to be selectively pruned or all messages left
intact and a action created to conduct a second pass.</p>

<p>So, today, Monday 9 January 2006, saw the dawn of my new email handling
strategy.</p>

<p>If the message contains technical content of interest, it gets
immediately filed as &#8216;Reference&#8217;. Some messages contain interesting
technical content that merits further investigation. This is normally
some bold assertions that are unproven or not understood by me (not
hard). These lead to an action &#8216;To do sometime&#8217;.</p>

<p>If I replied to an email asking for more information, I would delete the
incoming message and create a corresponding task in &#8216;Waiting&#8217;. The
original email thread is accessible from the &#8216;Sent&#8217; folder.</p>

<p>I treated any email with an attachment quite specifically. If the
attachment was relevant, I separated the attachment which was then filed
on the file system. In most cases, the email could be deleted as the
information was contained in the accompanying document.</p>

<p>If an email purely provides contact details (name, address, email,
phone) etc, I immediately add the contact to my address book. Sometimes,
if I am travelling in the near future, I will also print a hard copy so
I know where I am going, who I am seeing and where I am sleeping as this
always helps.</p>

<p>A couple of messages to lesser used email aliases just needed an new
filter rule defining so that this content is automatically routed to a
dedicated folder and only spends a few fleeting seconds in the &#8216;Inbox&#8217;
and my consciousness.</p>

<p>Similarly, I chose to unsubscribe from marketing messages from companies
or if I really do want the information automatically filter those
messages to a dedicated folder.</p>

<p>The net result is that I now get far fewer messages in my Inbox so it is
easier and quicker to process them and the messages that do arrive in my
Inbox are far more relevant to me.</p>

<p>So now I look at each email message on arrival. Well that&#8217;s not quite
true. I have started to turn email off if I am working on something that
needs concentration to avoid the continual interruption and context
switching as I am easily distracted.</p>

<p>Close of play. Inbox - 3. All messages that need to be acted on
tomorrow.</p>
