  <div class="entry-content"><p>I used to have a Psion 5. This was a neat little personal organiser in
a clam shell case with a mini QWERTY style keyboard. The Psion even
had a port of the &#8216;vi&#8217; editor available. However, after the novelty
wore off, I didn&#8217;t use it much other than a few shortlived pointless
games and as a glorified address book when sending out my Christmas
cards.</p>

<p>Years later, I worked with some young, trendy individuals who wore
Diesel trousers who taunted me as they all gradually acquired new,
shiny Palm PDA&#8217;s. Of course, I simply couldn&#8217;t face them with my aged
Psion so I went out and bought a Palm Vx.</p>

<p>Inevitably, the initial novelty soon wore off, the young things
upgraded to different designer trousers and yet another trendy mobile
phone (with camera) and I didn&#8217;t use my Palm Vx much either apart from
as a glorified address book for the annual Christmas card list.</p>

<p>Anyway, over the weekend, I decided to dust off the Palm and see
whether it might be useful for capturing ideas for blogs. As the Palm
had lain unused for so long, the batteries were totally dead and the
device had been reset to its factory status. I performed a
synchronisation with Palm Desktop using the Infrared link to check the
communications were working.</p>

<p>Then I went to re-install Beyond Contacts from
<a href="http://www.dataviz.com/">DataViz</a> which synchronises data from
Microsoft Outlook with the Palm. All my details were stored in my
online profile at DataViz, so I was able to quickly obtain my
registration key and upgrade to the latest version for free.</p>

<p>So now I can use the Graffiti application to enter information into
the Palm, synchronise to my PC and then into the blog. I wonder if
this will be quicker and more convenient than scribbling with a pen
onto the back of an envelope. We will see.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://oracledoug.com/serendipity/">Doug Burns</a> recently was kind
enough to
<a href="http://oracledoug.com/serendipity/index.php?/archives/915-My-New-Favourite-Blog.html">refer</a>
to my little, embryonic blog.</p>

<p>I had been lurking around the Oracle blogs for a while and had
commented on a posting on Doug&#8217;s blog about his wife&#8217;s positive
reaction to the recently launched Teleport service (TV and video on
demand)</p>

<p>Now this wasn&#8217;t purely a trite comment is a desperate attempt to get
someone other than the Technorati bot over to my blog. I am a Telewest
customer and had previously remarked on the launch of the Teleport
service on my own
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2005/10/06/developments-at-telewest/">blog</a>.</p>

<p>However, it struck me that if I had been at UKOUG and if I had just
happened to be introduced to Doug Burns (an admittedly unlikely but
possible scenario), would I have uttered the same words to his face as
I posted on his blog ?</p>

<blockquote><p>Now you&#8217;re back from Birmingham UKOUG, take your wife out for a meal.
If she is getting &#8216;excited&#8217; about re-runs of Tuesday night&#8217;s BBC news
and Binge Britain Uncovered on Teleport, she desperately needs it :-)</p></blockquote>

<p>And, well, to be honest, I am still not sure. I guess it would have
depended on whether he was wearing a kilt or not.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Take some time to think of ideas and develop content for the blog. I
tend to jot down lots of different ideas for possible brilliant,
informative articles for the blog. However, most get discarded as when I
subsequently re-read them, I discover that they don&#8217;t even make sense or
interest me. Some ideas are developed and refined over a longer period
while other blog entries are more spontaneous.</p>

<p>As you are composing the article, review the text carefully as you go.
If the blog editor has a &#8216;Preview&#8217; option, use it to review the text
again before finally hitting &#8216;Publish&#8217;. When the article is published,
review it yet again. I almost always still manage to find a nonsensical
or rambling sentence on this final pass. I also subscribe to my own feed
and read the article in Thunderbird where there is still scope to find
the odd typo which is irritating as it means modifying and re-publishing
the entry.</p>

<p>Although you are not writing an essay for an English exam, people are
more likely to enjoy the content if the article is well structured and
readable, spelled correctly and free of careless typos. I prefer to use
English and avoid the use of slang or text message speak.</p>

<p>Keep the article short. Maybe I am unusual but I have a very short
attention span. If a blog entry is five pages long then I am unlikely to
persevere right through to the end unless it really is compulsive
reading. Similarly, I tend to break articles into short paragraphs to be
easier on the eye.</p>

<p>If the article is long or contains detailed technical content (code
examples), consider breaking it into separate, shorter articles (Part 1
of 4) or maybe present the material in a different format (like a
conventional Web page or write a book).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Don&#8217;t. Build it and they will come (probably). Try and focus on the
style and content of the blog. Try to keep updating the blog on a
regular basis. Make it easy for people to subscribe to the blog by
creating an RSS feed - <a href="http://www.feedburner.com/">Feedburner</a> is a
popular, free choice. If you have succeeded in getting people to visit
the blog and, better, maybe even subscribe to it, try to keep new
material coming otherwise the blog will surely wither and die together
with the interest of the your audience.</p>

<p>It is worth setting up pings so the main blog search engines index
your blog. I manually ping <a href="http://technorati.com/ping/">Technorati</a>
after posting a new article (and check my posting gets indexed in due
course) and just let Feedburner automatically ping a few more blog
services.</p>

<p>I have also started to include Technorati
<a href="http://technorati.com/help/tags.html">tags</a> at the end of the
article.  Initially I was a little reluctant to include tags that are
specific to Technorati as it may be superceded in the future by
another technology (remember how Altavista got obliterated by Google)
but the use of Technorati tags does appears to be standard practice in
the blogging community and does help in driving traffic to the site.</p>

<p>Try not to succumb to the temptation to go around adding meaningless
comments (e.g. &#8216;Great blog!&#8217;) to other blogs in a subtle effort to get
people to come and visit your blog. Even though, you succeeded in
passing the onerous word verification test, this is not much better
than spam and some might consider it rude. Instead, try to provide
some useful contribution to the topic in question.</p>

<p>Do not put Google Adsense ads on your blog. Ads put me off almost
immediately and waste valuable space on the screen. The dot com boom
and been and gone. I would love it if you prove me wrong but no-one is
going to get rich from a personal blog.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t become obsessed by the statistics for your blog. However, this
is easier said than done and I find myself spending time, pouring over
the Web logs and statistics reports for my blog. Maybe the analysis of
the Web statistics (spiders, robots, RSS readers and the occasional
human being) what was popular, the growth of the blog over time,
spikes, the relative popularity of different referrers etc would be
the basis for a interesting article.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>London, near England - Wednesday 2 November 2005</p>

<p>The Oracle community was reeling yesterday from the revelation that
the universally respected, internationally renown technical expert and
long standing Oracle employee,
<a href="http://tkyte.blogspot.com/">Thomas Kyte</a>, had made a mistake.</p>

<p>The error was discovered by a Senior Oracle DBA based in Solihull in
the UK, Mr. N. Brightside who explained:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;I was dearly looking forward to attending the UK Oracle User Group
in Birmingham and hoped to get my copy of Tom Kyte&#8217;s latest book,
(Expert Oracle - Database Architecture) signed by Tom
personally. However, at the last minute, my manager told me that the
end of Q3 was imminent and there was no budget available for the
daily 4.50GBP return rail fare. So, I decided to &#8216;work from home&#8217;
and sit down to savour Tom&#8217;s excellent
<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1590595300/qid=1130415782/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl/202-3162097-9903838">book</a>.
Imagine my surprise when I found what appeared, at first sight, to
be a typographical error on page 38. In a paragraph discussing other
relational database systems, Tom incorrectly refers to &#8216;Ingress&#8217;
instead of &#8217;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingres/">Ingres</a>&#8217;.  Then
to my horror, a quick search on AskTom revealed that Tom makes this
identical misspelling elsewhere. It was not a typo, it was a genuine
mistake.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>A spokesperson for Apress (the publisher of Kyte&#8217;s book) commented:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Thank you for the feedback on Tom Kyte&#8217;s book. We were unaware of
this problem and will update the Errata section accordingly in due
course. However, we did note Tom had a tendency to use a mixture of
&#8216;Apres&#8217;, &#8216;Apress&#8217; and &#8216;Apresss&#8217; in communications while writing the
book. We attributed this to the long hours he was working on the
book, the tight deadlines or a faulty auto-repeating &#8216;S&#8217; key.  When
we politely brought this to his attention, he was absolutely
mortified and apologised profusely for the inconvenience (additional
hard parses, increased latching and CPU utilisation) caused.
Thereafter, he would only refer to the company as &#8216;:B1 Publishing&#8217;.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Tom Kyte was quick to acknowledge the error and said he was only too
pleased to correct the problem although he thought all the fuss and
extra work involved was rather a &#8216;bind&#8217;.</p>

<p>Don Burlesson was unavailable for comment but sources reported he was
&#8216;absolutely ecstatic at the news&#8217;.</p>

<time datetime="2005-11-02T00:45:33+00:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Nov 2<span>nd</span>, 2005</time>
        
         | <a href="/blog/2005/11/02/comparison-of-blinklist-delicious-and-furl/#disqus_thread">Comments</a>
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>After briefly evaluating <a href="http://furl.net/">Furl</a>,
<a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a> and
<a href="http://www.blinklist.com/">Blinklist</a>, I finally decided to ditch Furl
and spurn the advances of del.ico.us in favour of Blinklist as my
preferred one stop shop for all my social bookmarking needs.</p>

<p>Furl was my first experience of &#8216;social bookmarking&#8217; but, as I became
more comfortable with the idea of tagging Web pages, I found the Furl
interface is simply horrible. There are simply too many key clicks
required to add a single tag let alone two ! And if you want to add a
brand new category, it takes so long that you have almost lost the will
to tag the page and forgotten why it was of interest in the first place.
It looks like the tagging functionality was added on as an afterthought.</p>

<p>I then experimented with del.ico.us as loads of people seem to rave
about it and it appeared to be the longest established technology. After
all, 50 million Web 2.0 officiandos and satisifed del.ico.us users can&#8217;t
be wrong, can they ?</p>

<p>However, just imagine that you are a first time user and you encounter
the del.ico.us home page for the first time. The initial impression of
the home page is absolutely terrible. What is it ? What does it do ? How
do you use it ? How do you get help ? Where is the FAQ ? Or the tutorial
? Also, there is the confounded sub-domain - del.ico.us - and the oh so
clever pun which I took three weeks to grasp.</p>

<p>After my previous post on social bookmarking, a nice gentleman from
Blinklist spammed - sorry commented - on my blog to tell me about the
existence of Blinklist so I felt obliged to evaluate Blinklist as well.</p>

<p>Blinklist&#8217;s interface looks modern and clean, well designed and thought
out as though they employ proper Web designers who actually use the
system themselves (&#8216;eat your own dog food&#8217;). Contrast that with the
initial page presented by del.ico.us which looks like an undergraduate
knocked it up during a lunch hour and a manager said &#8216;Looks good - let&#8217;s
run with it!&#8217;</p>

<p>It is true that I had some teething problems with Blinklist; for example
when the tag editor kept insisting on SHOUTING AT ME and the odd tag got
duplicated. However, I used the feedback form and tried to provide some
constructive feedback to the Blinklist development team. Almost
immediately, I found myself in direct email contact with a lead
developer (well he could be the CEO for all I know) who passed on my
suggestions and got them addressed very quickly. Sometimes they appeared
to be making releases as quickly as I was providing feedback.</p>

<p>One of the best features of Blinklist is the tagging of pages is really
quick and intuitive. Suitable tags are suggested automatically (which
are usually adequate) and it is trivial to add as many new tags as you
want - quickly. Blinklist also has a facility to import del.ico.us
archives which worked fine for me when importing my massive archive of
15 pages. Your mileage may vary if you have 5,000 del.ico.us pages.</p>

<p>Although Blinklist doesn&#8217;t keep a Web archive of the saved pages (like
Furl) this doesn&#8217;t really bother me as I can use the Internet archive if
it really comes to it.</p>

<p>Of course, Blinklist has some disadvantages. I presume that Blinklist
are a small startup and they are the new kid on the block in what is
already a crowded marketplace. Worse, it is obvious that those clever
people at Google labs will inevitably be entering this space (RSS
Reader, My Search History) in the not too distant future.</p>

<p>Secondly, Blinklist has a relatively small user base (compared with
Furl, del.ico.is, <a href="http://spurl.net/">spurl</a> et al) although this is
compensated by the more intelligent, discerning type of people using the
service and subsequent higher quality of the Blinklist content.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When I started this blog, I simply composed the posts in the Blogger
editor which was adequate. Until one day, when I lost the complete text
of a draft posting due to finger trouble. As I laboriously re-typed my
masterpiece, I wished I had a blog editor with the infinite undo,
auto-save and all the other features of Emacs.</p>

<p>However, composing the drafts in the Blogger editor was useful as I
could edit drafts from anywhere and then publish the blog very easily.</p>

<p>I then looked at <a href="http://www.writely.com/">Writely</a> and
<a href="http://www.writeboard.com/">Writeboard</a> which fit the bill but are
really intended for collaborative writing on the Web and don&#8217;t have any
integration with Blogger.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.qumana.com/">Qumana</a> Blog Editor also looked very
interesting as it includes integration with Blogger and built-in support
for Technorati tags but still was essentially a cut-down Word lookalike
interface.</p>

<p>Then I realised I had the perfect blogging editor sitting right under my
nose all the time - Emacs. I can use all of Emacs powerful text editting
features and simply save the draft text on my Web server using ange-ftp.</p>

<p>Adding Technorati tags is easy using Marshall Kirkpatrick&#8217;s
<a href="http://marshallk.com/technorati-tag-troubleshooting">BlogTags</a>
bookmarklet.</p>

<p>The only thing Emacs is missing is the ability to seamlessly publish to
Blogger and another minor irritation is the fact that some whitespace
gets jumbled when pasting the text into Blogger.</p>

<p>However, Emacs being Emacs, some kind person has created a Lisp package
(<a href="http://elisp.info/">weblogger.el</a>) that provides integration with
Blogger although I haven&#8217;t actually tried it yet.</p>

<p>And please don&#8217;t ask why I don&#8217;t use the Blogger for Word
<a href="http://buzz.blogger.com/bloggerforword.html">extension</a>. I can simply
think of nothing worse. I wouldn&#8217;t wish it on my worst enemies.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recently stumbled upon Lisa Dobson&#8217;s Oracle Newbies
<a href="http://newbiedba.blogspot.com/">blog</a>. Firstly, although I have never
met Lisa, I admire her for two reasons. Firstly, she is about to give
a presentation at the UK Oracle User Group in Birmingham. I am a good
deal older than Lisa and the prospect of presenting to a large number
of &#8216;grumpy old men&#8217; would fill me with absolute dread.</p>

<p>Secondly, I really like Lisa&#8217;s rather self deprecating, modest
statement on her profile</p>

<p><em>I&#8217;ve been an Oracle DBA for 3 years, so still consider myself
a&#8217;Newbie&#8217;!</em></p>

<p>In my various jobs, I have met several people working with Oracle with
less than three years experience who are variously described (either
by others or themselves) as gurus and would take serious offence if
anyone ever had the temerity to describe them as a &#8216;newbie&#8217;.</p>

<p>Some of these people are indeed experienced, knowledgeable,
approachable, flexible, adaptable and eager to learn and perhaps, just
as importantly, to share their knowledge and teach others.</p>

<p>Others are undoubtedly very clever people but are somewhat narrow
minded in their outlook and suffer from tunnel vision. These types are
normally the self-appointed wizards but viewed as insular and
unapproachable by others. They will improve performance almost
instantly by adding or dropping an index, or gathering statistics but
fail to communicate the fact to anyone but merely bask in the glory
and yet higher, even more elevated status.</p>

<p>One aspect of my job that I enjoy is that I often visit a client for a
short period (2-3 days) so I am blissfully ignorant of the politics,
history and personalities involved. In addition, I simply do not have
the time (or access) to use email to communicate. Instead I find I get
more achieved quicker if I meet people face to face or call them on
the telephone to find out information.</p>

<p>This can lead to some interesting situations. Often, the same
questions couched in a slightly different way from a fresh face can
lead to a different response. For example, a simple request to patch
Oracle to 9.2.0.7 or to simply start the OEM Agent that has been
repeatedly requested but ignored (or denied) for many months can
miraculously become feasible almost immediately.</p>

<p>It is surprising how many so called technical issues actually turn out
to be about communication.<a href="http://www.technorati.com/tags/Oracle">\ </a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Imagine walking into a department store to buy a TV. You weigh up all
the possible options and decide which model you want. The price of
this TV is 457GBP. The assistant says &#8216;That will be 457 pounds, Sir&#8217;
as she takes the credit card payment and arranges delivery for next
week.</p>

<p>You then happen to go up to the second floor and see the identical TV
for 422GBP. That&#8217;s 35GBP cheaper than what you&#8217;ve just paid. You go
back to the assistant who sold you the goods to query this difference
in the price. Unfortunately, the assistant is now on her lunch break
but you are promised that she will call you back. She doesn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>You then leave the department store via the ground floor where you see
the identical TV priced at 565GBP.</p>

<p>You arrive home and just happen to check the credit card receipt. The
amount debited is 476GBP instead of 457GBP. Silly you; you should have
checked the amount more carefully at the time. You call the department
store to complain. The customer services manager you need to speak to
is on a break but he will call you back immediately. He doesn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>Well that is how online shopping for a Dell computer works. There are
many different possible ways to configure the identical specification
for a desktop PC and get a completely different price ranging from
422GBP to 565GBP. This difference appears to depend on which path
(Offers page, Dimension page) you followed through the Dell web site
(and which E-Code is listed) when you added and subtracted the various
possible options to configure the final system.</p>

<p>So, if you are thinking of buying a computer from Dell, always compare
every conceivable way of configuring the final system before placing
the order. Always order on the Internet once you are confident you
have obtained the cheapest price. Never order on the telephone from a
human being. I was given one price on the telephone and when the
invoice arrived via email, a higher price was listed.</p>

<p>Alternatively, it might be just simpler to buy your computer
elsewhere.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Watches are useful. My main requirements for a watch are:
1.  Display the precise time at all times.
2.  Do not need any maintenance like winding or changing the batteries.
3.  Automatically adjust for GMT/BST.
4.  Automatically adjust for current timezone anywhere in the world.
5.  Light. I don&#8217;t want or need a micro-computer on my wrist that also</p>

<pre><code>tells me the weather, my resting heartbeat and the altitude.
</code></pre>

<p>So I bought this Casio Waveceptor
<a href="http://www.casio.co.uk/Products/Watches/Wave%20Ceptor/WVA-430TDU-1A2VER%20-%7C%20Radio%20Controlled,%20Solar%20Power%20/At%20a%20Glance/">watch</a>.
1.  This watch synchronises with a radio transmitter to guarantee the</p>

<pre><code>time is absolutely 100% correct at all times. I know this works
because the watch is always precisely in sync with my digital TV
service (and British Rail at Waterloo). The two transmitters are
located in the UK and Germany but I rarely travel outside Europe.
</code></pre>

<ol>
<li>The watch is solar powered so does not need winding or any
batteries. No more replacement batteries costing a fiver every two
years. No more lengthy discussions about invalidating the warranty
because the jeweller has to open up the back to fit the new battery.</li>
<li>Yes.</li>
<li>Almost but not quite. When travelling, you have to temporarily set
your location to the current city and the watch adjusts
automatically.</li>
<li>The titanium strap means the watch is very light.</li>
</ol>


<p>Close to absolute perfection.</p>
