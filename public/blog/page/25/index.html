  <div class="entry-content"><p>Since accumulating 9 penalty
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/12/22/seasons-greetings/">points</a>,
Norma has been very worried about the possible consequences of my
irresponsible actions and dangerous driving. A driving ban would have
severe, wide reaching consequences for my glamorous job in IT
consultancy, affect our busy social life not to mention the logistics of
ferrying the kids to all their hobbies.</p>

<p>After lodging an appeal with Surrey Traffic Police, I gleefully accepted
a place on a half-day &#8216;Speed Awareness Workshop&#8217;. Attendance at the
workshop cost &pound;95 but was in lieu of the proposed 3 point penalty so was
well worth the money. Plus the instructor was an attractive lady. After
registration, coffee and friendly introductions, we all swapped amusing
anecdotes of our various speeding offences, recounted hard luck stories
and were tested on stopping distances in the rain.</p>

<p>After lunch (lovely sandwiches and volavons), we all looked at some
horrific photographs of mangled car wreckage, listened to victims of car
accidents and, worse of all, watched the instructor viscously smash a
peach on the table with a claw hammer.</p>

<p>As I wiped peach juice off my face, I cunningly positioned myself next
to the instructor for the grand finale which was an evangelical type
experience where we all hugged each other and proclaimed in a single,
united and very loud voice: &#8216;In the name of the Father, the Son and
Surrey Traffic Police we hereby pledge, that we will never exceed the
speed limit ever again&#8217;.</p>

<p>The only problem was that the roads were really empty on my route back
home and the weather conditions were dry with excellent visibility. I
was a little late for my evening meal (Chicken Kiev on Tuesday night),
Manchester United were playing live on TV and so I promptly picked up
another &pound;60 fine and the very 3 penalty points, I had spent the
afternoon avoiding.</p>

<p>Norma was not pleased. Since then, I have been accompanied on every
single trip by a new backseat driver. A voice from the passenger seat
who keeps piping up:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;Speed camera, 500 yards. Limit - 40 miles per hour&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>&#8216;Yes, yes OK, I know this road and I am doing 42 mph and they never do
you for that.&#8217;</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;Speed camera. Limit - 40 miles per hour. Reduce speed.&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>&#8216;All right. All right. Just shut up will you ? I am down to 39.5 mph
now.&#8217;</p>

<p>When the danger has passed, the backseat driver gives a distinctive 3
toned whistle and is silent until she spots the next possible hazard.
Once again, my irritating back seat driver pipes up in that dull,
monotone voice</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;Possible mobile camera site ahead. Limit - 50 miles per hour.&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>We all frantically scan the landscape for police hiding in the bushes
wielding a hand held radar gun and wait for the triumphant 3 tone
whistle that means &#8216;OK - put your foot down.&#8217;</p>

<p>Sometimes I am sorely tempted to go for a crafty drive on my own without
my back seat driver in attendance.</p>

<p>Sometimes, I am tempted to ask the back seat driver to shut up and just
let me drive.</p>

<p>Sometimes, I am tempted to silence the back seat driver by cutting her
communcation cord.</p>

<p>Sometimes, I am tempted to grab the back seat driver by the neck and
shove her back in the glove box.</p>

<p>But I can&#8217;t because the back seat driver is my
<a href="http://www.activegps.co.uk/novus-delta.htm">friend</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last Thursday, 152 people (16 crew and 136 passengers), in addition to a
significant number of people living in Hounslow, narrowly escaped death
when a British Airways flight from Beijing (BA038) was forced into an
emergency
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/7196526.stm">landing</a> at
Heathrow airport.</p>

<p>Several things struck me about this
<a href="http://www.aaib.dft.gov.uk/latest_news/accident__heathrow_17_january_2008___initial_report.cfm">incident</a>
and the aftermath:</p>

<ul>
<li>After a phone call to update me on all the domestic news and gossip,
my wife somehow negated to impart this tidbit of useful and relevant
information. I hung up and turned on the TV news to be staggered by
images of the wrecked fuselage of a British Airways jumbo jet lying
of the fringes of the runway, 15 miles from my house, surrounded by
foam, slides deployed with 18 fire appliances surrounding the scene.</li>
<li>As I was flying from Belfast into Heathrow the following day, I
consulted the BMI website which curiously maintained flights would
be subject to delays and cancellation following, in a slight
understatement, the &#8216;incident at Heathrow&#8217;. Funnily, enough, the
<a href="http://www.aaib.dft.gov.uk/home/index.cfm">AAIB</a> agrees with me and
defines an accident as &#8216;an occurrence during the period of operation
of an aircraft where the aircraft incurs damage&#8217;.</li>
<li>A man from Oxford who walked away with his life would have quite
liked British Airways to provide him with a <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7196128.stm">cup of
tea</a> followed by some
counselling.</li>
<li>Another couple thought they had just had &#8216;a bumpy landing&#8217; and
therefore didn&#8217;t require any tea and biscuits. In fact, these Aussie
backpackers were just delighted to get their baggage back without
queuing at the carousel and to receive a complimentary return ticket
for the Heathrow Express.</li>
<li>A surreal moment boarding the flight at Belfast, picking up a
newspaper with the stricken 777 plastered all over the front page.</li>
<li>British Airways&#8217; decision to
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/7198598.stm">parade</a> the
pilot, co-pilot and Julie, your cabin service director, before the
world&#8217;s press. The BA crew all looked shell-shocked and distinctly
uncomfortable. Mind you, so would I, if I was slowly starting to
assimilate the events and trying to recover from a near death
experience (without a cup of tea). This implied to me that BA were
either very keen to get the media off their backs and leave them
alone and/or BA are already absolutely certain of the circumstances
of the accident and knew for a fact, pilot error was not a possible
contributory factor.</li>
</ul>


<p>Finally, I must confess that I know absolutely nothing about airplanes,
fly by wire or wind shear. I am also totally ignorant of the size of the
pigeon population of South West London and possible deficiencies in the
quality of Chinese aircraft fuel.
However, if the AAIB investigation subsequently discovers, in the coming
months, that the co-pilot had successfully brought a 100 ton aircraft
into a crash landing, having lost power to both engines, and
miraculously managed to clear the perimeter fence by 10 feet, I will be
truly amazed at the skill of the pilots.</p>

<p>If the investigation shows that, following a catastrophic,
non-reproducible computer error, the co-pilot somehow had the foresight
to raise the flaps to somehow bring the aircraft down on the grass to
stop it within 300 feet instead of landing on the concrete runway where
it surely would have exploded with complete loss of life, wouldn&#8217;t that
be the most staggering and heroic feat ever ?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Siebel customers (and employees alike) all over the world are busy
enjoying
<a href="http://www.paulmcnamara.com/blog/2008/01/16/metalink3/">Metalink3</a>
which has recently replaced SupportWeb.</p>

<p>Everyone (well me, mainly) is taking great delight in taunting Oracle
DBA types with incredulous cries of &#8216;Sorry - did you say you&#8217;re still on
legacy Metalink2 ?&#8217;</p>

<p>A number of readers, impressed with this bleeding edge technology and
dying for more, have emailed me asking why this humble Siebel
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/drupal/blog">blog</a> hasn&#8217;t yet been updated
to Drupal <a href="http://drupal.org/drupal-6.0-rc2">6.0 RC2</a>.</p>

<p>Consequently, I downloaded the distribution for Drupal 6 Release
Candidate #2 and, unusually for me, I even took the time to read
&#8216;UPGRADE.txt&#8217;. I followed the instructions therein and took the site
offline so any visitors receive a configurable, professional looking
message: &#8216;This site is being upgraded to bleeding edge CMS technology.
Please spread the news and don&#8217;t forget to taunt any Oracle DBA&#8217;s.&#8217;</p>

<p>After that completely unnecessary configuration change (I have no
visitors), I was then unable to login to initiate the upgrade. Sigh.
Thankfully, I discovered this <a href="http://drupal.org/node/133910">article</a>
from another early adopter which enabled me to regain control of my
original site.</p>

<p>I attempted the upgrade from Drupal 5.3 which failed to modify the
database schema and produced a worrying number of SQL errors.</p>

<p>Not to be defeated, I read this helpful
<a href="http://drupal.org/node/209450">article</a> which implied the Drupal 5.x
system should be running the latest stable release (5.6) which seemed
eminently sensible advice.</p>

<p>I quickly upgraded from Drupal 5.3 to 5.6. Only I couldn&#8217;t because my
site was now inaccessible after the partial, incomplete upgrade so I had
to hold my breath while I restored from yesterday&#8217;s MySQL database
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/01/30/automated-mysql-backups/">backup</a>
which worked perfectly.</p>

<p>Then I upgraded Drupal from 5.3 to 5.6, having naively convinced myself
this would fix the problem, and duly repeated the upgrade process to 6.0
RC2 which promptly failed with the same dire, database related, results.</p>

<p>Still, this is a beta release after all and sure enough (as always),
some other poor soul has already been
<a href="http://drupal.org/node/212381">there</a> and done that.</p>

<p>No fix yet. Roll on RC3.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am jet-lagged because a customer asked me to fly, at short notice,
from Newcastle to Belfast at 07:05 on Wednesday morning.</p>

<p>I had a suspicion this was important because when I told the client that
my flights between London and Newcastle were non-refundable he replied
&#8216;I don&#8217;t care about that. Just get on a plane to Belfast.&#8217;</p>

<p>Initially, I was harbouring hopes of watching Newcastle play Stoke City
in a Cup Replay on Wednesday evening and I was about to politely enquire
about the possibility of departing early on Thursday morning when the
project manager added: &#8216;Oh and take anything you might need to install
Siebel and clone our existing environment on to brand new, standalone
infrastructure.&#8217;</p>

<p>My normal concerns about oversleeping were accentuated by the fact I was
booked for my first ever flight on EasyJet. I was worried about no
e-ticket, additional charges for a seat, additional charges for checking
my bag into the hold, additional charges for an overpriced cheese and
bacon panini. I was terrified about lengthy queues of people going to
Florida and the Alps for &pound;24.99 (+ &pound;110 tax and fuel surcharge) blocking
my path to the single check-in desk.</p>

<p>So, I duly went to bed at 20:30 and set my alarm for 04:45 to allow a
full half hour to get dressed, double check my passport and Siebel
DVD&#8217;s, find the night porter, check out of the hotel and impatiently
wait for my taxi (booked for 05:15).</p>

<p>However, recurring nightmares about being 16 seconds late for the
check-in desk and featuring on &#8216;Airline&#8217; woke me at 04:12 precisely. I
also dreamt of Tony Robinson filming my arrival, flustered and stressed,
at the bright orange check-in desk at 06:26.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;Mr. Norman Brightside is desperately trying to get to Belfast for an
urgent business meeting but unfortunately for Norman and the hordes
behind him, the check-in desk for the Belfast flight has just closed.
Norman is now having a discussion with Lisa.&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>Holiday makers with young children and lads going to Prague for a stag
week are tutting behind me as I plead:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;Listen Lisa, it&#8217;s not my fault. I have been up since 04:30 but the
taxi driver kept talking about Kevin Keegan and I simply must get to
Belfast to install Siebel for a training course that starts on
Monday.&#8217;
&#8216;Well I am very sorry, Sir but I have asked the pilot and there&#8217;s
simply no way you can catch this flight. You will have to book on the
next one at 17:25 tonight.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Listen. You don&#8217;t understand. This is a brand new environment, on
machines yet to be installed, isolated behind a corporate firewall.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Why don&#8217;t the network, comms and infrastructure team just create a
secure VPN link between the two data centres ?</p>

<p>&#8216;Yeah, I know, Lisa. Tell me about it, but if that was feasible, I
could tunnel through from the Sunderland office and I wouldn&#8217;t be
standing here in my pyjamas, would I ?&#8217;</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was almost tempted to let Kevin Keegan&#8217;s
re-<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/n/newcastle_united/7192457.stm">appointment</a>
as manager of Newcastle pass without comment.</p>

<p>After Mourinho&#8217;s departure, the Premiership (and the media) desperately
needs some more characters and
<a href="http://www.whoateallthepies.tv/2008/01/the_top_20_kevi.html">soundbites</a>.</p>

<p>However, I just read that since his departure from Manchester City,
Keegan has been running a football
<a href="http://sport.independent.co.uk/football/premier-league/article3345117.ece">circus</a>.
YCNMIU.</p>

<p>The ideal preparation for his latest role. And just for old times sake,
take a second to remember this classic (in full).</p>

<p>Let the mind games begin.</p>
