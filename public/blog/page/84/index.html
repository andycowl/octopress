  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://oracle-base.blogspot.com/">Tim Hall</a> was right. I can resist
everything except temptation.</p>

<blockquote><p>Install Apache 1.3.2 for Windows. Very quick and easy. Slight feeling
of version envy. The latest version is 2.x. Will upgrade later.
Install mySQL 5.0 for Windows. Very quick and easy. Install mySQL
Administration Tools 1.1. Very quick and easy. Install mySQL
QueryBrowser 1.1.9. Very quick and easy.</p></blockquote>

<p>Login to mySQL database. Create a table. Insert a record. Select the
record. All seems fine.</p>

<blockquote><p>Install PHP 5.12 for Windows. Very quick and easy.</p></blockquote>

<p>But wait, what&#8217;s that ? I actually have to do some work and edit Apache
&#8216;httpd.conf&#8217; because that code hasn&#8217;t been written yet. Read
&#8216;install.txt&#8217; for details. Oh no. Make the necessary changes. Now the
Apache service doesn&#8217;t even start. No Apache error log. Have to run
something called Event Viewer. Investigate for 3 minutes. Get bored.
Consider reformatting disk, installing Linux and using</p>

<blockquote><p>./configure; make; make test; make install</p></blockquote>

<p>Kids want to use computer. I want to watch the football. I need to get a
move on. I haven&#8217;t got all day.</p>

<p>Stumble across <a href="http://www.wampserver.com/en/">Wamp</a> (Apache 2.0.55,
mySQL 5.0.18, PHP 5.12 bundle). Phew. Version envy dissolves.</p>

<p>Wamp (Apache) doesn&#8217;t install cleanly due to conflict with existing
installed programs. Uninstall everything. Reboot. Reinstall wamp which
is successful. Nice dashboard with phpMyAdmin and mySQL interface
(SQLiteManager).</p>

<p>Download <a href="http://www.joomla.org/">Joomla</a>. Use browser based
installation which runs perfectly. Run Joomla. Looks nice.</p>

<p>Download <a href="http://gtd-php.sourceforge.net/">gtd-php</a>. Configure. Create a
GTD database and tables. Run gtd-php. Looks nice.</p>

<p>Try to create a project. Get &#8216;403 Forbidden&#8217; error. Ask politely for
help. Google points me at a similar
<a href="http://www.wampserver.com/phorum/read.php?f=2&amp;i=3874&amp;t=3874">issue</a> in
Wamp. Make the suggested edits. Adding items now works ! Add the
following &#8216;Next Actions&#8217;</p>

<blockquote><p>Install Apache Install PHP Install mySQL Install Joomla Install
GTD-PHP Add mySQL to CV</p></blockquote>

<p>Mark all actions as done. How very satisfying. Turn computer off.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last night, I was standing at London Waterloo station, sincerely hoping
that the engineer would be able to fix the carriages for my train home.</p>

<p>Suddenly, there was a stampede of people rushing past me. What on earth
was happening ? Was this some spontaneous act of flash mobbing ? Had a
train arrived unexpectedly at platform 4 for those impatient people from
Basingstoke ? Or was there some sort of inaudible terrorist alert
mumbled by the station announcer that I had missed ?</p>

<p>The answer transpired to be none of the above.</p>

<p>Krispy Kreme Doughnuts were giving out free samples to promote the
opening of a new outlet.</p>

<p>A gentlemen in a suit gleefully came away clutching not one but two
large (pizza style) boxes. He also had a can of Stella Artois poking out
of his pocket. Bizarre.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Bit of a ghostly theme today.</p>

<p>One great aspect of my job is that I write SQL scripts that are reviewed
and executed by other people. This suits me just fine. The less work for
me, the better.</p>

<p>Obviously, I never add &#8216;spool off&#8217; to the tail of a SQL*Plus script.
This is a whole ten characters to type (including newline). Multiply
this by all the SQL scripts you might produce in a lifetime and just
think of how much time that would waste. In any case, everyone knows
that &#8216;exit&#8217; implies a &#8216;spool off&#8217; anyway.</p>

<p>A while ago, a friendly Oracle DBA ran my SQL script and called me to
tell me it had finished. I asked him to email the spooled output for
review. He said there was no spooled output generated. I asked him to
check the current directory (no), %ORACLE_HOME%\BIN directory (no),
the Recycle Bin (no), search all local hard drives for &#8216;patch_prod.lst&#8217;
(no).</p>

<p>I asked him if the SQL*Plus session was still open and, if so, to
simply type &#8216;spool off&#8217;. He replied that the SQL*Plus session had
already been ended. I was puzzled until I asked &#8216;Is this the GUI version
of SQL*Plus on Windows ?&#8217; &#8216;Yes&#8217;, he replied. &#8216;Did you end the session
by hitting the &#8216;X&#8217; button ?&#8217; &#8216;Yes&#8217;.</p>

<p>So, it turns out that the spool file is lost when Windows SQL*Plus is
terminated using the &#8216;X&#8217; button. I didn&#8217;t know this fact because I
normally use &#8216;exit&#8217; to close any SQL*Plus session on Unix, Dos Command
Window or Cygwin.</p>

<p>I had a suspicion that this gentleman was privately quite enjoying this
moment and my discomfort so I said &#8216;Hmm - that&#8217;s a shame. I really
wanted to check the spool to ensure that I had deleted the correct 7.9
million invoices from production&#8217;.</p>

<p>Later on, I asked myself what type of <del>mindless idio</del> person uses &#8216;X&#8217;
to terminate a Windows SQL*Plus session.</p>

<p>Then the answer struck me. A
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/01/27/unix-for-lazy-people/">lazy</a>
one. Like me.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&#8216;<a href="http://www.livingtv.co.uk/mosthaunted/">Most Haunted</a>&#8217; is a fantastic
TV program hosted by Yvette Fielding, where a Liverpudlian psychic
medium, Derek Acorah, visits haunted properties resurrecting the spirits
of dear, dead departed souls.</p>

<p>The program is notable for absolutely superb acting by Acorah who can
fulfill a variety of roles, effortlessly adopting the voice of tortured,
Victorian ladies, in pitch darkness, without the aid of a script.</p>

<p>The supporting actors (Fielding and the camera crew) are also superb.
They are simply wasted on Living TV. A career in Hollywood surely
beckons.</p>

<p>I was fortunate enough to catch a &#8216;Best of Most Haunted&#8217; over Christmas.
It was simply the most riveting, compulsive, hilarious viewing.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have been playing a CD in my car on Disc-Random-Shuffle mode for ten
weeks. The CD contains close to 200 songs. I have heard all the songs
once, some twice and a handful three times.</p>

<p>This morning, I heard something that sent a shiver down my spine,
chilled my bones and momentarily froze me to the spot.</p>

<p>&#8216;<a href="http://www.lyricscrawler.com/song/86355.html">Spectre versus
Rector&#8217;</a>by The Fall. This
&#8216;song&#8217; is a 8 minute rant from Mark E. Smith accompanied by some noise,
detailing a ghostly story from the &#8216;Dragnet&#8217; LP. &#8216;Spectre versus Rector&#8217;
sounds as if it was recorded in a bleak, industrial warehouse somewhere
up North with a hand-held tape recorder.</p>

<p>The very last song to be selected. Spooky.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am a very efficient lazy person. I don&#8217;t like to type seven characters
when two will suffice. I think Unix is a fantastic development
environment. However, the overly long, verbose commands irritate me
slightly. So I use the following aliases and shell functions</p>

<blockquote><p>a = tail -f ${ORACLE_HOME}/rdbms/log/alert_PRD.log\
 l = ls\
 ll = ls -l\
 up = cd ..\
 x = rm -fr *\
 z = wall &#8216;Anyone fancy a quickie after work ?&#8217; [disciplinary action
pending]</p></blockquote>

<p>One of the happiest days of my life was when I discovered the tab
completion feature in the GNU bash shell and the environment variable
$OLDPWD.</p>

<p>When I used to work for Sequent (with an operating system called
Dynix/ptx devoid of applications), I used to carry the GNU tools and
utilities around on a cartridge tape. Unix and GNU tools were brilliant
but the best development tool is Emacs.</p>

<p>The second happiest day of my life was when I discovered Emacs&#8217; dynamic
abbreviation feature. If you had had to suffer the pain of typing
&#8216;supercalifragilisticexpialidoceous&#8217; once, then subsequently, you could
just type &#8216;sup&#8217; following by ESC-/ and Emacs automatically, magically
completed the word. This was without doubt the best feature in Emacs.
Well apart from Gnus, VM, font-lock, C-mode, dired, support for shell,
grep and cc. Oh and apart from being able to edit text files.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Joomla, Chumbawamba, Oompa Loompa</p>

<p>I really like the presentation of Howard Rogers&#8217;
<a href="http://www.dizwell.com/">site</a> (and the integration of Forums, Blog and
now an Oracle Wiki) and have followed, with interest, the evolution of
the site in different formats, and enjoyed Howard&#8217;s thoughts on various
content management technologies over recent months before he finally
settled on <a href="http://www.joomla.org/">Joomla</a>.</p>

<p>I am also very impressed by the new look of Niall Litchfield&#8217;s
<a href="http://orawin.info/services/">orawin.info</a> site which also uses Joomla
and is a marked contrast (and improvement) from its
<a href="http://www.niall.litchfield.dial.pipex.com/">predecessor</a>. In fact, I
just find myself gazing at the desert landscape for minutes on end.</p>

<p>I now find myself struggling to resist a very strong temptation to
install Apache, PHP, mySQL and then Joomla on my PC at home just because
it would be an interesting exercise.</p>

<p>This activity would also satisfy all the necessary pre-requisites for
installing and playing with <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress.org</a> which
is also very tempting.</p>

<p>However, I must be strong and resist. I know what will happen. I will
encounter a few problems, solve them by reading the documentation, FAQ,
finally get it all working and enjoy a brief period of satisfaction.</p>

<p>Then, knowing that I was able to do it and it worked, I will almost
immediately lose interest and fail to really experiment with Joomla and
WordPress at all.</p>

<p>I know this because last year, I thought it would be a brilliant idea to
get all my vinyl records out of the loft, transfer them to digital
format and then dispose of them.</p>

<p>I bought a cable from Tandy to hook up my record player to the PC. I
connected it incorrectly and nearly blew my tiny, tinny PC speakers. I
then investigated what software packages I would need to convert the
large WAV files to MP3 format and label each individual track in ID3
format.</p>

<p>I settled on <a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/">Audacity</a> which did the
job perfectly well and was another high quality, free, OpenSource
software package.</p>

<p>Then I converted just one side of one LP - The Wonderful and Frightening
World by The Fall. In fact, I didn&#8217;t even do one side. I just did one
song (Lay of the Land) which took a few iterations but finally, I had an
MP3 version of the song.</p>

<p>Then, as soon as I knew it could be done, despite investing all this
time, I almost instantly lost complete interest in the whole exercise.</p>

<p>I never even converted another song, let alone attacked the pile of
singles and LP&#8217;s. I am slightly worried that this indicates a
personality trait that is a cause for concern (i.e. I am a perpetual
starter but not a finisher).</p>

<p>The downloads are underway&#8230;</p>
