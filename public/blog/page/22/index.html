  <div class="entry-content"><p>Oracle <a href="http://oracleappslab.com/">AppsLab</a> is one of my longest
standing and favourite blogs.</p>

<p>Jake Kuramoto (and the AppsLab team) always post interesting and thought
provoking articles and I also share a few areas of common interest
(Twitter, Disqus, FriendFeed et al).</p>

<p>Although I happen to work for the same company as Jake Kuramoto, I have
never actually met Jake in person. Curiously, I have had more
interactions with Jake by commenting on the blog as opposed to
communications via Oracle email.</p>

<p>When I read this recent
<a href="http://oracleappslab.com/2008/06/20/connect-v2-is-live/">post</a>
announcing a new version of Oracle Connect (an internal networking
initiative within Oracle behind the corporate firewall), my immediate
reaction was: &#8216;Why did he post this to the AppsLab blog ? Why on earth
would this possibly be relevant, or of interest, to non Oracle employees
?&#8217;</p>

<p>Then I realised such internal developments are of interest to a wider
audience as it demonstrates Oracle&#8217;s committment to &#8216;Web 2.0&#8217;
technologies.</p>

<p>I also pondered how long it would have taken me to find out about this
upgrade if I wasn&#8217;t subscribed to the AppsLab blog.</p>

<p>There is a certain irony in finding out about internal developments
within Oracle on a public blog.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>On Friday I returned from a very enjoyable week in Brussels. Hard work,
challenging customer and miscellaneous technical issues. However,
unusually, I had the pleasure of the company of a few of colleagues so
we were able to have a chat over a meal and share a few excellent beers
together.</p>

<p>Over the past five years, I have visited so many European airports, that
they all tend to blur into one. However, certain key characteristics
soon reminded me that I was indeed back in Brussels.</p>

<p>The lenghty queue for the 123 taxis to pass the roadworks to reach the
set down area. The massive queue to clear passport control. The cursory
glance at your passport from the policeman followed by a grunt. The long
and winding road to security. The same officious, self-satisfied,
arrogant security staff. Unfortunately, this queue doesn&#8217;t actually move
as crew (acceptable) and security staff, cleaners, shop assistants (less
so) keep jumping the queue because they are so important.</p>

<p>The short flight itself is uneventful enough although there is a little
turbulence on the descent into London. Then, as I fold my tray and
return my seat to the upright position, fear is struck into the very
core of my heart as I witness something no-one should ever have to
witness on an aircraft.</p>

<p>My immediate neighbour reaches into here rucksack for a bottle of orange
Powerade. She stands up and screams &#8216;For the glory of Allah !&#8217; and
switches her digital watch to UK time. No, no - only joking.</p>

<p>Suddenly and without any warning, the young lady next to me reaches for
the &#8216;Call&#8217; button with her left hand while simultaneously extracting the
&#8216;Sick Bag, unfolding it and skillfully placing it under her mouth.</p>

<p>I respond by edging away, averting my gaze and covering my knees and
expensive Pierre Cardin suit with various sections of the Daily Mail. I
note an interesting story about fashions for the summer on my right
thigh.</p>

<p>The BA stewardess comes promptly and is kind and reassuring. A glass of
iced water arrives and she dispenses some magnificent advice on coping
with motion sickness: &#8216;Take your jacket off to stay cool, keeping
sipping the water and oh - don&#8217;t forget to breathe.&#8217;</p>

<p>Once we clear the cloud cover, the flight is smooth once again and the
potential crisis is averted.</p>

<p>We land at Terminal 5 and park on a remote stand. Unfortunately, the
young lady is unable to disembark, get some fresh air and rush to the
nearest lavatory. After 10 minutes, the smooth, well-spoken co-pilot
announces the bad news:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;I&#8217;m awfully sorry, ladies and gentlemen but there will be a slight
delay. We are just waiting for some steps and buses to be brought to
the aircraft but BAA groundstaff have been practising for the
tomorrow&#8217;s arrival of George W. Bush and there are now significant
delays as a result.&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>After 15 minutes, no-one screams with delight or initiates mock applause
at the sight of a single bus. We are British, you see. The steps arrive
5 minutes later so half the passengers are free to disembark. But not
us, sitting in rows 15-28.</p>

<p>I contemplate brandishing a bottle of Lemon Powerade and and screaming
&#8216;Take me out of here to the land of Heinz 57 vestal virgins. Now.&#8217; While
this might accelerate my exit from my plane, it might leave me with some
explaining to do.</p>

<p>Finally, after 35 mins, we descend the steps. The co-pilot was indeed
correct. BAA have been busy practising for Bush&#8217;s arrival. There are
eggs, rotten tomatoes and discarded placards strewn across the tarmac. I
pause briefly to kiss the ground before boarding the bus. I am left with
the pungent after-taste of rotten egg in my mouth.</p>

<p>How ironic, given his record, that the outgoing President refuses to
enter the UK at a military base and instead chooses to bring chaos to
Heathrow just to get his ego stroked.</p>

<p>We now enter the Stargate style timewarp in order to enter the main
Terminal 5 building. Well, it must be a timewarp because on my outbound
journey, I noticed mutiple signs containing the dire warning: &#8216;Please do
not enter Satellite B unless your flight departs from &#8216;B&#8217; gate. It will
take (at least) 40 mins to return.&#8217;</p>

<p>Which is weird as it took me just 5 minutes, using the timewarp.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The Chameleons used to cover ATV&#8217;s &#8216;Splitting in Two&#8217; for an encore. Reg
(guitar) played the drums and John (drums) played bass. Mark Burgess
threw himself into the crowd and chaos ensued.</p>

<p>Burgess also used to improvise snippets of The Fall&#8217;s &#8216;Rowche Rumble&#8217;
and occaisionally Joy Division&#8217;s Love Will Tear Us Apart and some
Beatles tune.</p>

<p>8 minutes of pure, manic, unsurpassed joy.</p>

<p>I once asked Mark Perry of ATV (via email) what he thought of the cover.
He replied that he loved it and had even guested with The Chameleons for
an encore at a gig at The Lesser Free Trade Hall.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Thursday 15 May - Manchester, near England</p>

<p>107,239 hungover Rangers&#8217; supporters (and an exiled Scotsman who drove
up from Coventry) firmly blamed Great Manchester Police for last night&#8217;s
scenes of fighting, violent disorder and urinating in the street.</p>

<p>One fan, Jimmy &#8216;Och Aye Jimmy&#8217; McTavish from Glasgow, claimed:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;Everyone was having a great time in Piccadilly Gardens, sunbathing,
drinking and joking around with the police.</p>

<p>At 19:35, everyone went to the toilet, big Gordon put the kettle on,
Doug popped out for popcorn and we all sat down to enjoy Rangers&#8217;
biggest game in 36 years on the big screen.</p>

<p>Then, without any warning, the police switched channels to &#8216;Coronation
Street&#8217;. That&#8217;s when it all kicked off.&#8217;</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have to say I am a little surprised at this breaking
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/man_city/7372872.stm">news</a>.
Still, I guess
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/07/03/the-wit-and-wisdom-of-sven-goran-eriksson">Eriksson</a>
will draw another excessive compensation package while he seeks
alternative employment.</p>

<p>In my view, buying all those expensive foreigners, beating United twice
and finishing mid-table was a creditable first season.</p>

<p>Mind you, I always had niggling reservations about Mr.
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/06/22/theatre-of-comedy">Shinawatra</a>.</p>

<p>So, who&#8217;s next for the job at Manchester City - Jose Mourinho ?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Mark Krynsky posted a interesting post on Twitter (sorry, I simply can&#8217;t
bring myself to call them &#8216;Tweets&#8217;)
<a href="http://twitter.com/krynsky/statuses/799063372">inviting</a> readers to
share their first ever Twitter post.</p>

on this blog way back on 12 March 2007.</p>

<p>Perusing the archives of my own continuous stream of inance drivel did
unearth the odd gem - well OK then - the occaisional notable one-liner
in a continuous stream of inance drivel.</p>

<ul>
<li>&#8216;giving twitter yet another chance. After all, 3 Oracle bloggers
can&#8217;t be wrong !&#8217; - 23 January 2008</li>

box behaves strangely. You can cut text but DEL and BS don&#8217;t work.
Weird&#8217; - 23 January 2008</li>
<li>&#8216;I see txt spk is an obvious way to save characters but I despise it
as I tend to write in English with proper sentence construction and
gram&#8217; - 23 January 2008</li>
<li>&#8216;I once saw The Smiths on 3 successive nights in Warwick, Leicester

going to Habari (yet). Now importing WP blog to perform &#8216;gap

Now fighting obsessive theme porting disorder&#8217; - 21 February 2008</li>

in this 140 character mode of thinking&#8217; - 22 February 2008</li>
<li>&#8216;Email to colleague: &#8216;Keegan worries me. He seems to have completely
lost the passion. He seems a broken man&#8217; - 26 February 2008</li>

condom) whenever they hear about Profilactic (FriendFeed competitor)
