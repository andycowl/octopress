  <div class="entry-content"><p>Many years ago, in a parallel universe not far from here, I was involved
in a
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/07/14/30-second-guide-to-crm/">CRM</a>
&#8216;proof of concept&#8217;. This involved producing a demonstration of a
callcenter application accessing customer and product data from
disparate legacy systems in a polished, unified, modern user interface.</p>

<p>The scenario was pretty standard fare. A motor insurance company where a
customer calls in to renew his motor policy and the callcenter agent
walks through a standard &#8216;question-answer-retort&#8217; guided dialogue.</p>

<p>The demo climaxes in a superb cross-sell to add the customers son who
has just turned 17 as a named driver to the existing policy (the
pre-sales guy was positively orgasmic about this addition) with a
substantial discount as part of some campaign.</p>

<p>Now, choosing
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/07/20/whats-in-a-name/">names</a> is
very important so of course the demo initially used dead pop stars,
politicians, historic figures, alternative comedians and footballers.
This was mainly because the marketing guy thought TEST USER wouldn&#8217;t
impress the CEO&#8217;s of blue chip companies.</p>

<p>The initial novelty of using celebrity names soon wore off as we
struggled to make the software components actually do what we wanted. In
fact, we were desperately tired of the endless repetitions of the
dialogue (&#8216;Take 369&#8217;), that we were completely oblivious to the names
appearing.</p>

<p>We were just hoping and praying just that the demo behaved and ran
through to completion without an hourglass, a blue screen or an
unexpected &#8216;cross-sell&#8217; opportunity emerging from the &#8216;Home, Buildings &amp;
Contents&#8217; division.</p>

<p>Finally, the proof of concept was finished, we were exhausted and the
demanding marketing man was (finally) happy.</p>

<p>Imagine our surprise, a few weeks later when he returned with two
complimentary CD&#8217;s. &#8216;Great job guys. The Sales MD was absolutely
delighted and thinks this collateral will really help us make that
breakthrough into SME in Q3. I thought you might be curious to see the
fruits of your labour.&#8217;</p>

<p>So we thanked him, waved goodbye, then sat down to watch the CD. We were
both genuinely dumbfounded when the following words, spoken in best BBC
English, came out of the tinny PC speaker:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;Norman Whiteside of Manchester is looking for a competitive quote for
his car insurance. &#8217;</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s nothing worse than slaving away all day over a hot keyboard
trying to coerce various pieces of software to synchronise a single
customer record from one legacy system to another.</p>

<p>Of course, the mouth-watering and long awaited climax to a hard days
graft (and knowledge transfer) finally arrives at 18.47 when you are
tired, irritable and just want to go home.</p>

<p>This is it. This is your moment. Seize the day. You are poised of the
edge of greatness, about to scale your own personal Everest.</p>

<p>There is only one thing stopping you. We have to choose a name for the
&#8216;customer&#8217;.</p>

<p>Your heart sinks as the integrator pauses for an eternity, pauses again,
looks enquiringly and then suddenly types in:</p>

<blockquote><p>Username: TESTUSER FirstName: TEST LastName: USER</p></blockquote>

<p>You politely plead: &#8216;That&#8217;s really not a good name to use.&#8217; &#8216;Why ? Oh
wait. I get it. We will need more than one account for testing.&#8217; Your
mood darkens still further as he modifies the data:</p>

<blockquote><p>Username: TESTUSER1 FirstName: TEST LastName: USER1</p></blockquote>

<p>You snap and the wafer thin veneer of professionalism and consulting is
shattered. &#8216;Excuse me. Can I drive for just one minute ?&#8217;</p>

<blockquote><p>Username: MSTIPE FirstName: Michael LastName: Stipe</p></blockquote>

<p>A small point admittedly but one that significantly increases the
satisfaction levels for everyone concerned when that confounded customer
finally appears on the other side.</p>

<p>All of which reminds me of another

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Quelle horreur !</p>

<p>A female UK blogger is
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/5196228.stm">sacked</a> by a
French company, supposedly for &#8216;gross misconduct&#8217;.</p>

<p>I went to look at the actual
<a href="http://www.petiteanglaise.com.nyud.net:8080/">blog</a> to discover what
juicy office gossip she had revealed, but the blog is such an
incoherent, rambling mess of disjointed thoughts using pseusonyms to
conceal her true identity, I simply gave up.</p>

<p>Inevitably, Robert Scoble thinks this is very, very
<a href="http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/2006/07/19/french-blogger-sacked/">important</a>.
I don&#8217;t.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My long suffering wife and I celebrate our wedding anniversary every
year in July.</p>

<p>To mark this momentous milestone, <del>I buy her flowers, chocolate,
champagne and book a corner table at our favourite restaurant</del>, the
wife takes the kids camping in the New Forest with her girlfriends while
I make the annual pilgrimage to the Hook Norton
<a href="http://www.hookybeerfest.co.uk/">Festival</a> of Fine Ales with my mates.</p>

<p>So, if you&#8217;d like to read something from me in a different style, full
match reports for the

<a href="http://goathurling.blogspot.com/2003_07_01_goathurling_archive.html#105907557962806664">2003</a>
festivals are already available online together with photos of a human
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/25633426@N00/31142547/">pyramid</a>. We even
have our own <a href="http://www2.flickr.com/photos/mymuk/28264243/">stalker</a>.</p>

<p>So, it transpires that my first blog article was actually written four
years ago - not just a personal web journal but collaborative blogging
(Blogger) and social networking (Flickr) and I didn&#8217;t even know it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was enjoying a scan through the archives of Andrew Sherman&#8217;s incisive,
witty (and occasionally downright
<a href="http://andrewsherman.blogspot.com/2004/11/my-crow-costume-for-halloween.html">scary</a>)
<a href="http://andrewsherman.blogspot.com/">blog</a> when I suddenly thought &#8216;Hey
Andrew - where are the links ?&#8217;</p>

<p>Then I realised. The hyperlinks are actually embedded in the title which
is exactly where they should be.</p>

<p>At last. After 7 months, I have finally discovered something useful you
can do in Blogger which is not (currently) supported in WordPress.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When you are in a crisis meeting, and a consultant or project manager
says &#8216;We desperately need an intervention from ABC - now !&#8217;, do you ever
find yourself idly scribbling the lyrics from Interpol&#8217;s &#8216;Say Hello To
the Angels&#8217; on your pristine pad of white paper ?</p>

<blockquote><p>This is a concept\
 This is a bracelet\
 This isn&#8217;t no intervention</p></blockquote>

<p>Two hours later, in the same crisis meeting, when the same consultant or
project manager forcefully asks &#8216;Is Freddie Geekmeister from Advanced
Technical Support engaged ?&#8217;, are you ever tempted to reply &#8216;No. As far
as I know, Freddie Geekmeister is currently a bachelor of this parish&#8217;.</p>

<p>When the ratio of the combined letters of the To: and Cc: distributions
lists divided by the number of letters in the email is high, do you ever
find that the relevance and worth of the actual content is
correspondingly low ?</p>

<p>When you say to someone, &#8216;I got your mobile phone number off your
.signature so thanks for that and they reply &#8216;You&#8217;re welcome&#8217;, are you
ever tempted to reply &#8216;Well actually no I didn&#8217;t because you don&#8217;t have
a .signature so I had to ask 8 different colleagues from 3 different
companies which wasted 37 minutes before I finally tracked you down&#8217;.</p>

<p>And when the crisis meeting finally draws to a close, and the project
manager spontaneously asks you to read out aloud, to all 17 attendees,
those three, crucial, important, decisive actions that he has seen you
jotting down on your A4 pad, which will immediately rectify the
situation, do you ever find yourself in a mild state of panic ?</p>

<p>Or is it just me ?</p>
