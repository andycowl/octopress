  <div class="entry-content"><p>I briefly used
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/04/19/1gb-memory-stick/">Box.net</a>
as a virtual 1GB memory stick. Briefly because after the initial
transfer of important files, the onus was on me to identify files I had
changed recently and upload them.</p>

<p><a href="https://mozy.com/?ref=L57WLN">Mozy</a> seems better suited to lazy people.
You simply download a lightweight client, identify folders you want
mirrored and Mozy encrypts and mirrors them, quietly in the background.</p>

<p>When you add new files, Mozy mirrors the incremental changes. Mozy
offers 2GB of storage for free.</p>

<p>Also, Mozy includes the phrase &#8216;Reticulating splines&#8217; during
initialisation.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>[With apologies to Cabaret
<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Nag-Cabaret-Voltaire/dp/B00006IK6Y">Voltaire</a>]</p>

<p>I want to synchronise my Thunderbird address book between work and home
and my Palm Vx. I also want to synchronise Google
<a href="http://calendar.google.com/">Calendar</a> with
<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/calendar/sunbird/">Sunbird</a> and my
aging Palm. This is for two reasons; to synchronise and simultaneously
back the data up. I feel nervous and exposed, like an Oracle DBA relying
on nightly exports.</p>

<p>One option was to repeatedly export/import the data between applications
but that is far too time consuming and I am lazy.</p>

<p>I noted with interest, Matt&#8217;s recent
<a href="http://photomatt.net/2006/09/11/plaxo-revisited/">experiences</a> with
<a href="http://www.plaxo.com/">Plaxo</a> but decided that the name sounded too
much like Sage &amp; Onion
<a href="http://www.rhmfoodservice.co.uk/brands/paxo/stuffing">stuffing</a>. Also,
the Plaxo Thunderbird plug-in doesn&#8217;t currently support multiple address
books.</p>

<p>Then I happened across EngTech&#8217;s superb
<a href="http://engtech.wordpress.com/">blog</a> and this excellent
<a href="http://engtech.wordpress.com/2006/08/11/the-holy-grail-of-synchronization-how-to-synchronize-microsoft-outlook-multiple-locations-google-calendar-gmail-ipod-and-mobile-phone-with-funambol-scheduleworld/">article</a>
which describes how to use ScheduleWorld as a synchronisation hub (using
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SyncML">SyncML</a>) to synchronise anything
to anything in any direction and put an end to all human suffering (well
almost).</p>

<p>I signed up for a free <a href="http://www.scheduleworld.com/">ScheduleWorld</a>
account (the login page looks strangely reminiscent of Google) and
successfully synchronised ScheduleWorld with Google Calendar.</p>

<p>Then I downloaded the Calendar Sync4j
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=149326">extension</a>
for Thunderbird 1.5 and synchronised an appointment (&#8216;MUFC v Celtic&#8217;)
from the Thunderbird Calendar to ScheduleWorld onto Google (and all the
way back again).</p>

<p>The I remembered what I was actually supposed to be doing and configured
Thunderbird to access the ScheduleWorld LDAP server. This worked once I
read the
<a href="http://www.scheduleworld.com/tg/globalAddressbookConfig.jsp">documentation</a>
properly and used the numeric ID (instead of the email account).</p>

<p>This is not truly synchronisation in the old sense of propreitary
conduits and commercial products. This is purely storing data on a
server with an open, standard (LDAP) interface manipulated using various
client applications to perform, err, synchronisation.</p>

<p>Now Thunderbird could retrieve contact details from ScheduleWorld.
Unfortunately, Thunderbird currently has no SyncML support embedded so
Thunderbird is unable to modify the address book. However, I was able to
export addreses to LDIF format, import to the ScheduleWorld server and
manage (clean) the data using the ScheduleWorld Web interface.</p>

<p>ScheduleWorld doesn&#8217;t currently support <del>bisexual</del> bi-directional
synchronisation with Gmail contacts which would be the &#8216;killer app&#8217; and
the icing on the cake but if/when the Google API allows it, even this
may be possible.</p>

<p>The only disadvantages in this blissful state of nirvana is the fact
that the Palm is now an legacy application, an islolated silo and I will
erase the entire contents of my Palm address book. Consequently, I will
forget to send Great Auntie Agatha a Christmas card including my
traditional round-up of the year together with a delightful family
photograph.</p>

<p>This is because Great Auntie Agatha doesn&#8217;t have an email address and
her details solely resided on the Palm. Great Auntie Agatha will then
pass away peacefully in her sleep next May. All my relatives will be
rich beyond their wildest dreams while I will receive absolutely nothing
after this Christmas card debacle.</p>

<p>I will then be forced to pursue legal action against &#8216;EngTech&#8217; and the
brilliant author of &#8216;ScheduleWorld&#8217; so if someone could furnish me with
their real names and addresses, I would be eternally grateful.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Thankfully, I don&#8217;t have cause to use Microsoft Excel much. My kids can
produce pretty charts about the demographics of pet ownership in the
classroom better and quicker than I can.</p>

<p>Excel is a very powerful product but the sheer size and complexity of
the software is just overwhelming which makes it difficult (for novices)
to accomplish straightforward tasks.</p>

<p>For example, people are kind enough to send me gargantuan, complex
spreadsheets where I want to freeze the header row while scrolling data
down to the sole point of interest on row 23,538. A seemingly simple
task.</p>

<p>Microsoft Excel</p>

<p>Exhaustively search all Menu options. Look in online help. Ask that
irritating paperclip wizard: &#8216;So what is it you are trying to do, you
idiot ?&#8217;. Try some random control key combinations. Plaintively ask for
the data in Oracle DMP format.</p>

<p>Slump over the keyboard, weeping in despair, randomly striking keys
which unexpectedly reveals a buried <a href="http://www.eeggs.com/items/719.html">Easter
Egg</a> (a fully fledged Doom clone).
No wonder Excel is so bloated. Search the Microsoft Web site. Search
using Google.</p>

<p>Finally, admit defeat and sheepishly ask a (Microsoft Certified)
colleague who sneers &#8216;God - don&#8217;t you even know that ? Place the cursor
on the row you want to lock. Hit Windows-Freeze Panes. There you go. Oh
no - sorry - you place the cursor on the first row you want to scroll
normally.&#8217;</p>

<p>Google Spreadsheets</p>

<p>Sort - Fix Header Rows - Freeze 1 row. Screen updated to reflect user
action (1 row frozen). Done.</p>

<p>Sometimes, <a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/01/16/less-is-more-2/">less is
more</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Thoroughly enjoying &#8217;<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/09/07/margrave-of-the-marshes/">Margave of the
Marshes</a>&#8217;
and pleased to see <a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/01/10/in-praise-of-mark-burgess/">The
Chameleons</a>
get a mention:</p>

<blockquote><p>For David Fielding of The Chameleons, that meant loitering outside
Broadcasting House in order to press their tape directly into John&#8217;s
paw.
In the case of The Chameleons, John thought he was the victim of a
practical joke after listening to their demo: the recording was so
accomplished that he suspected he had been given a cassette of an
established band.</p></blockquote>

<p>&#8230;although this slightly contradicts the
<a href="http://www.thechameleons.com/press/index.php?type=Photos&amp;PhotoID=1">note</a>
that John Peel sent back to the band where Peel describes the tape as
&#8216;Very muffled&#8217;.</p>

<p>A few years, when Mark Burgess got married, I made a paltry contribution
to a wedding present. A few weeks later, I was staggered to receive an
email from Mark Burgess thanking me together with a draft chapter of his
(still unpublished) autobiography. Mark also describes travelling down
to London and hanging around outside Broadcasting House with a tape.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I subscribe to a fair number of blogs.</p>

<p>Some of those bloggers use Blogger (despite my WordPress evangelism).</p>

<p>Some of those Blogger bloggers are technical types who would normally
seize any chance to play with newly announced beta software.</p>

<p>Curiously, not a single one of them has experimented with the recently
announced Blogger
<a href="http://buzz.blogger.com/2006/08/blogger-in-beta.html">beta</a> which
includes exciting new developments like &#8216;Labels&#8217;, drag&#8217;n&#8217;drop page
design, private blogs (where you can be assured no-one is reading),
multiple authors, additional templates, RSS feeds and &#8216;instant&#8217;
publishing.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Holy Father</p>

<p>It is 23 years and 7 months since my last confession. Since then, I have
downloaded <a href="http://www.ethereal.com/">Ethereal</a> and started to sniff
packets off the network. I know it was wrong but we had worked for a
week on this problem. We had all exhaustively checked everything (twice)
and we were tired, hungry and increasingly desperate.</p>

<p>I fervently wished this was a conventional database problem or even an
unconventional Siebel problem but the symptoms, the controlled tests and
all the hard evidence increasingly pointed to &#8216;the network&#8217;.</p>

<p>Initially, I was swamped by gigabytes of meaningless data until I
discovered all about the powerful filters with an esoteric syntax (that
sometimes even worked). Then I could trace a complete &#8216;conversation&#8217;
between the browser and Web server. I was so excited when I could
actually examine HTTP requests and the associated response. Why I can
even look at the packet sizes and the actual contents with timestamps to
the nearest microsecond.</p>

<p>I am desperately resisting the urge to examine the detailed effects of
content expiry and static file compression and publish a whitepaper.
Worse still, I am feeling increasingly lured by &#8216;/etc/services&#8217; to find
interesting ports to sniff on.</p>

<p>Please have mercy on this wretched, miserable, pitiful sinner kneeling
before you.</p>

<p>Yours faithfully</p>
