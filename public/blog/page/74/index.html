  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was <a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/04/22/zohowriter/">worried</a>
that Google&#8217;s integrated suite of Web 2.0 office applications would pose
a threat to <a href="http://zoho.com/">Zoho</a> but another, more immediate
competitor has just
<a href="http://www.thinkfree.com/common/notice.tfo?method=viewNotice">launched</a>
this week.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.thinkfree.com/">ThinkFree</a> provides a similar service to
Zoho offering free, Web-based Word, Excel and PowerPoint software. I
found ThinkFree&#8217;s charts matches the features in Excel (and is better
than <a href="http://www.zohosheet.com/home.do">ZohoSheet</a> and
<a href="http://numsum.com/">NumSum</a>).</p>

<p>In fact, ThinkFree&#8217;s compatibility with Microsoft Office is so awesome,
at times, it is easy to forget you are not actually using
Word/Excel/Powerpoint. I am surprised the use of the small toolbar icons
does not constitute not a breach of copyright.</p>

<p>ExtremeTech produced an excellent, comprehensive
<a href="http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,1697,1952434,00.asp">review</a> of
ThinkFree which describes the features in more depth.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>People often ask me &#8220;Norman - when will you be updating your
award-winning &#8216;Sport bars of Europe &#8216;meme&#8217; ?&#8221;</p>

<p>No. 2 - The <a href="http://www.the-irish-rover.com/HTML/Home.htm">Irish Rover</a>
- Stroget, Copenhagen</p>

<p>Satellite feed - RTE. Thankfully, we were spared Tyler&#8217;s orgasmic &#8216;ON -
REEE !&#8217;</p>

<p>Food feed - Irish Rover Burger (inevitably). Just like a standard burger
in a English pub.</p>

<p>Smoke feed - Intense. Peaked around the time of the missed penalty.</p>

<p>Beer feed - Carls Special and Tuborg substituted at half-time for Leffe.</p>

<p>Game feed - A team in yellow outplayed and outclassed a team in red. The
team in yellow had a goal disallowed and missed a penalty. The team in
red appeared to win overall.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The city of Copenhagen (near Denmark) has a lot to commend it.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the view from my hotel window is not one of them.</p>

<p>Probably the worst view in the world.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just wrote a quick letter using
<a href="http://www.zohowriter.com/">ZohoWriter</a>. An interesting
product. Think of Microsoft Word on the Web. ZohoWriter supports the
standard WYSIWG editor, document versioning, collaboration, blog
publishing and export to Word/PDF formats. My document is saved safely
on a server in the event of any media based disaster striking my PC.</p>

<p>The only comments I have was that it wasn&#8217;t obvious how to suppress
the header and footer when printing the final hardcopy, I couldn&#8217;t see
a speel checker and WordPress.com wasn&#8217;t listed in the list of
supported blogging platforms. But don&#8217;t quote me as I never took the
time to RTFM so all of this may be possible.</p>

<p>Otherwise a decent product although I suspect
<a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a> will be unleashing a revamped version
of <a href="http://www2.writely.com/info/WritelyOverflowWelcome.htm">Writely</a>
soon which could be interesting competition (nail in coffin) for
ZohoWriter.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Web 2.0 aficionados, across the globe, held their collective breath
today as Mr. Norman Brightside, a little known and largely unsung
blogger, from Newcastle (near Norway) delivered his much awaited,
quarterly update to his renowned &#8216;State of the Blogosphere&#8217; address.</p>

<p>Fresh from the successful launch of a <a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/04/19/book-club/">book
club</a>, Brightside
told an adoring and expectant audience:</p>

<blockquote><p>The blogosphere is in a right old state. There are a few more blogs
appearing and the rate of growth is directly proportional to a
fascinating new factor.
Blogging growth = Technorati
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/70276096@N00/132028272/">apology</a> growth</p>

<p>For example, last month you might see the apology appear once a day.
Now you see the apology twice a day. You can immediately conclude that
the blogosphere has doubled in size during the period.</p>

<p>And, err, that&#8217;s it.</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In the first 13 minutes of 20 April 2006, there was a single hit on this
blog (no names, no pack-drill). Curiously, the recently added WordPress
feed <a href="http://wordpress.com/blog/2006/04/14/feed-stats/">statistics</a>
reported a surprising and rather unlikely number of 53 &#8216;estimated number
of people who used certain tools to read your feed&#8217; in the same period.</p>

<p>Now this is simply not true. Most of these 53 &#8216;people&#8217; were RSS spiders
and automatons dumbly and repeatedly polling for any activity. The
associated human being is probably down the pub or asleep.</p>

<p>While the RSS feed may have been subscribed to at some point (by me in
all probability) in the past, they are all now sitting unloved and
unread in a still born Web 2.0 beta account.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.qbrundage.com/michaelb/index.html">Michael Brundage</a> writes
an popular article about what it is really like to
<a href="http://www.qbrundage.com/michaelb/pubs/essays/working_at_microsoft.html">work</a>
at Microsoft. Flexible working environment, minimal paperwork, hard
work, gripes about managers, free drinks. So nothing too earth
shattering or surprising there.</p>

<p>But what struck me about this blog is that it <a href="http://www.qbrundage.com/michaelb/pubs/essays/this_is_not_a_blog.html">isn&#8217;t a
blog</a>.
It is simply a good old fashioned Web page.</p>

<p>No categories. No comments. No statistics. No trackbacks. No fancy
themes. No calendar. No widgets. No plugins.</p>

<p>Just words that fill most of the screen on a HTML page. And undoubtedly
the most interesting content I have stumbled across this week.
Sometimes, <a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/01/16/less-is-more-2/">less is
more</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have started a book club. I am the only member. I realise that this is
a little unusual but I prefer to choose the books myself rather than
someone else (or even worse, the Daily Mail).</p>

<p>I held my first meeting last night which was very well attended by all
members. Norman gave a fascinating review of &#8217;<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0330353977/ref=pd_kar_1/202-2505147-5837430">Into Thin
Air</a>&#8217;
by Jon Krakauer. This book was written by a journalist and experienced
climber who took part in a commercial, guided expedition to climb Mount
Everest in May 1996. After reaching the summit, bad weather struck
resulting in the death of eight climbers from three different
expeditions.</p>

<p>Interestingly, although the author achieved his goal and suceeded in
reaching the summit (shortly before the storm struck), there is hardly
any euphoria or pleasure only the grim realisation that he is half way
there, the descent is dangerous and his physical condition is
deteriorating fast with the demands of the high altitude and the lack of
oxygen.</p>

<p>Even though I am not a climber - in fact, I don&#8217;t really like heights (I
once had to be assisted from the<a href="http://www.capbridge.com/">Capilano</a>
Suspension Bridge in Vancouver by two ten year olds) - I thoroughly
enjoyed this book. It was well written and compulsive reading. The story
of the expedition unfolding, the ascent, the mix of characters and the
personal and honest account of the ultimate series of tragic events is
very sad and truly mesmerising.</p>
