  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just got my car a shiny, new MOT certificate as an early Christmas
present. The MOT certificate is a pre-requisite for renewing the tax
disc which expires at the end of the month.</p>

<p>The format of the MOT test certificate has changed and all MOT&#8217;s will be
recorded on a computer system at the Vehicle and Operator Agency (VOSA).</p>

<p>This means that you can now apply for your road tax
<a href="http://www.direct.gov.uk/Diol1/DoItOnline/DoItOnlineArticles/fs/en?CONTENT_ID=10021414&amp;chk=EzpJ7+">online</a>
as VOSA can also verify that the vehicle is insured using another
computer system.</p>

<p>Good news for me. One less trip into the <a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2005/12/13/circular-discussions/">Post

<p>Bad news for car criminals.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I subscribe to an RSS feed from the BBC about Manchester United.</p>

<p>This feed contains match reports, previews and general news about
Manchester United.</p>

<p>However, the BBC has an infuriating habit of throwing in content from
the Message Boards which are a forum for &#8216;fans&#8217;. Think 5 Live&#8217;s 606
radio phone-in but worse.</p>

<p>Worse, this
<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/mb606/F2241569?thread=1725706">article</a>
appears in the feed as a new article on 15 December. This is a thread
from the &#8216;606 message boards - Liverpool&#8217;. Newsgator displays the title
as &#8216;If Liverpool don&#8217;t give Chelsea a run for their money this season,
then we certainly will soon - DG&#8217; and the Web page thread is named &#8216;well
played today&#8217; referring to Liverpool versus Chelsea.</p>

<p>Why ? What possible relevance does this content have to MUFC ?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Once upon a time, I flew back from Lausanne in Switzerland to London.
Although the skies were clear, there had been heavy thunderstoms earlier
in the day so the plane was forced to hold above Heathrow. We flew
around and around in circles for so long that we eventually had to
divert to Bournemouth to refuel.</p>

<p>This impromptu diversion confused the trio of Swiss people sitting
behind me who thought London was &#8216;quite small&#8217; and &#8216;very green&#8217; and why
&#8216;is no-one getting off&#8217; after we had landed and sat around for 15
minutes on the runway at this small, provincial airport.</p>

<p>This confusion was because British Airways were too incompetent to put a
French speaker on the crew on a flight from Switzerland. In fact, when
he realised he wasn&#8217;t actually in London, one of the Swiss passengers
then politely asked a stewardess why no announcements had been made in
French.</p>

<p>Events then descended into farce when the stewardess then made an
announcement for &#8216;any French speaking passengers to make themselves
known to the cabin staff&#8217;. The same Swiss passenger duly volunteered and
he then made an announcement over the loudspeaker system directed
primarily at his two fellow Swiss passengers who were sitting right
there, next to him.</p>

<p>So, after a complimentary drink to placate the Brits and prevent
rioting, we finally arrived 2 hours 30 mins late at London Heathrow. The
final straw was that it took British Airways a further 45 minutes to get
a set of steps and buses over to the remote stand at Terminal 4 so we
could actually leave the plane.</p>

<p>As I finally left the plane at 21.45 on a Friday night, I was tired, fed
up and just desperate to get home. The pilot was stood at the exit door,
smiling and saying &#8216;Good night&#8217; to all passengers.</p>

<p>I paused and told him that, while I understood that the diversion due to
the weather was unavaoidable, it was an absolute joke that the British
Airways could not arrange for ground staff to meet a plane that was over
2 hours late. The only consequence for me was that my tea was cold.
However, plenty of other passengers on that flight were desperately
trying to make connections to America and Asia. If the steps had been in
place, they might just have had a slim chance of making their onward
connection. With this additional delay, there was absolutely no chance.</p>

<p>The pilot just smiled again (which was quite irritating in itself) and
replied &#8216;Yes I know Sir. It is embarassing and bloody unacceptable and I
can assure you that I have made my views known in no uncertain terms.&#8217;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>More recently, as I have started to scan more blogs and newsfeeds, I
wanted a quicker, more efficient way of scanning through my growing list
of RSS sources so I investigated a few alternative RSS readers or
aggregators.</p>

<p>It was quite interesting to see how your own blog looks displayed in a
variety of different formats. All that self inflicted torture over the
templates, the CSS stylesheets, the sidebars, the fonts, the bulleted
lists is potentially meaningless when your reader might be reading a
simple text feed with more control over the presentation than you, dear
author.</p>

<p>The main things I need from an RSS reader are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Newspaper reading (for a group of blogs in chronological order)</li>
<li>Easy to manage related feeds into a collection of groups</li>
<li>Able to scan all (or a subset of) feeds for new articles</li>
<li>OPML import must preserve folder structure and merge feeds correctly</li>
<li>To be able to read comments in the reader</li>
<li>To be able to configure feeds on an individual and group basis</li>
<li>Mark feeds as updated when someone comments on an article</li>
<li>Personalised feed discovery/recommendation engine when you have read
everything in the blogosphere</li>
<li>Clippings for interesting articles</li>
<li>Able to synchronise state of feeds (articles read/unread) from PC
with Web based service</li>
<li>Integration with Web browser to quickly add new blogs and feeds</li>
<li>Support for newsgroups (and potentially email)</li>
<li>Free (or cheap)</li>
</ul>


<p>Originally, I was using
<a href="http://www.mozilla.com/thunderbird/">Thunderbird</a> which was fine for a
handful of blogs but is not able to read a group of blogs in newspaper
fashion. This is quite important as in the Oracle community, people are
often posting or reacting to earlier posts by others in the same closely
knit community.</p>

<p>I also tried <a href="http://sage.mozdev.org/">Sage</a> but that had the same
problem (no newspaper support) although I really liked the
auto-discovery feature where you can tell Sage to scan for feeds on the
current Web page and subscribe with a single click.</p>

<p>I then tried <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/">bloglines</a> as I already had an
account, it appears to have been around the longest and because lots of
people seem to use it and like it. However, for reading a group of
blogs, bloglines lists the articles blog by blog and not in
chronological order. Also, when importing OPML, bloglines creates
duplicate categories instead of intelligently merging them. I thought
the bloglines interface was generally confusing, new articles were not
immediately visible, reading was generally slow and organising feeds
into folders was tortuous in the extreme. Bloglines supports OPML import
but with this caveat - &#8216;Imported sites may take up to two hours to
update&#8217;.</p>

<p>I then tried another Web based RSS aggregator,
<a href="http://www.newsgator.co.uk/">Newsgator</a> which intelligently merged my
feeds and preserved the existing folder hierarchy. Some other RSS
readers just loaded the OPML into a long, flat list. Newsgator had a
clean, intuitive interface, supported groups of feeds and was quick.
Also, it was server based so the feeds and articles are portable across
any computer. I liked the clean, simple interface with the emphasis on
the text of the article. Newsgator also supports Clippings for articles
of interest.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/omea/reader/">Omea</a>from Jetbrains- a polished
professional .NET application. Excellent drag&#8217;n&#8217;drop interface for
quickly organising feeds into categories. Fast performance, easy to
understand, rich functionality. Probably my favourite desktop RSS
reader. Omea was the only reader to display comments in the reader. In
the Oracle blogging community, the comments are important. The Omea
Firefox plugin is not supported for Firefox 1.5 but will be by the end
of 2005 (prompt response to feedback). The only slight moan is the
startup and closedown time is long enough to merit a progress bar.</p>

<p><a href="http://pluck.com/">Pluck</a> is another Web based server which looks nice
(Desktop, Web) with synchronisation but crucially missing reading feeds
in a single group. Lots of advertising from their sponsors consuming
valuable screen estate.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.rssowl.org/">RSSOwl</a> - OpenSource. Clean interface. Import
of my OPML file ran so blindingly fast I missed it. Really fast
navigation and sensible interface design. Uses AmphetaRate for
personalised recommendations and feed discovery. Instant startup and
shutdown.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.feedreader.com/">Feedreader</a>- free, simple, lightweight RSS
reader but refuses to delete a folder unless you delete all 99 feeds
therein.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.rojo.com/">Rojo</a> is another server based aggregator with a
lot of emphasis on Web 2.0 (tags, contacts) and minimalist, modern
design but the article content seems almost secondary.</p>

<p>Google <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/things/tour">Reader</a> - pleasant
enough with familiar Google style look and feel but the interface and
functionality seems a little too simplistic once you have used other
desktop RSS readers.</p>

<p>I also briefly looked at <a href="http://www.rssbandit.org/">RSSBandit</a>(which
seemed to be unique in that it supported synchronistation using
FTP/WebDAV) and <a href="http://www.sharpreader.net">SharpReader</a> but by this
time I was suffering from RSS fatigue although Wikipedia had a tempting
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_news_aggregators">list</a>of even
more candidates.</p>

<p>For desktop readers, I really liked Omea (apart from the silly icon) and
RSSOwl (very nice icon) but after a few days, I realised that a unified
source of my feeds and the status of articles was more important than
the wealth of features available in a desktop RSS client so I decided to
stick with NewsGator which was the most impressive Web based service and
met most of my requirements.</p>

<p>PS. Oh no. I forgot the most obvious tool for all my mail/news/RSS needs
- <a href="http://gnus.org/">Gnus</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A couple of years ago, I was staying at a posh hotel in Oslo. I returned
to my room after a hard day&#8217;s work, looking forward to a very expensive
glass of beer.</p>

<p>I swiped my card and entered room 216. To my surprise, I found a strange
man in there. He was was emerging from the bathroom but thankfully, he
was fully clothed and alone.</p>

<p>My immediate reaction was to rapidly withdraw, apologising profusely.
&#8216;Oh I am awfully sorry. I appear to have the wrong room&#8217;. As the layout
and decor of the hotel was identical on each floor, I just assumed that
I had mistakenly entered room 316 (instead of 216).</p>

<p>I checked my key (room 216) and I checked the little wallet holder (room
216). I then stared blankly at the number on the door of the room I had
just entered - 216 - when the door opened and the gentleman appeared
again. I managed a quick peek into the room and saw my book on the desk
and my alarm clock by the bed.</p>

<p>The American stranger smiled and said: &#8216;Hey, you know. I think it might
be me who has the wrong room&#8217; and we agreed to go downstairs to
reception.</p>

<p>American: &#8216;There is a problem. I appear to have been given this
gentleman&#8217;s room.&#8217;</p>

<p>Receptionist: &#8216;Room number, please ?&#8217;</p>

<p>American: &#8216;Room 216.&#8217;</p>

<p>Receptionist: &#8216;Name ?&#8217;</p>

<p>American: &#8216;Costner&#8217;</p>

<p>Receptionist: &#8216;There is no problem. You are in room 216 and have the key
for room 216.&#8217;</p>

<p>American: &#8216;But this gentleman is already staying in room 216&#8217; (gestures
towards me).</p>

<p>I step forward to the desk amazed at what I have heard thus far.</p>

<p>Receptionist: &#8216;Name ?&#8217;</p>

<p>Me: &#8216;Brightside&#8217;</p>

<p>Receptionist: &#8216;Room number ?&#8217;</p>

<p>Me: &#8216;216.&#8217;</p>

<p>Receptionist: &#8216;Mr Brightside. You checked out of room 216 at 08.45 this
morning.&#8217;</p>

<p>Me: &#8216;No I didn&#8217;t. I am booked to stay here until tomorrow morning.&#8217;</p>

<p>Receptionist: &#8216;No. Mr Brightside. You checked out of room 216 at 08.45
this morning and paid in full with a credit card.&#8217;</p>

<p>Me: &#8216;No I didn&#8217;t.&#8217;</p>

<p>Receptionist: &#8216;Yes you did.&#8217;</p>

<p>[ To avoid an English pantomime exchange developing and as I was getting
increasingly annoyed&#8230;]</p>

<p>Me: &#8216;OK then. If I checked out of room 216 this morning, you must have a
copy of my bill and the the credit card slip with my signature on it ?&#8217;</p>

<p>Receptionist: &#8216;Yes, Sir. We do.&#8217;</p>

<p>Me: &#8216;Please can I see it then.&#8217;</p>

<p>Receptionist: &#8216;Yes.&#8217;</p>

<p>[ Walks off into office, obviously disgruntled ]</p>

<p>Receptionist: &#8216;I&#8217;m awfully sorry, Mr Brightside. There has been a
terrible mistake.&#8217;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just bought 30 second class stamps and sent a parcel recorded delivery
in the Post Office. The stamps cost &pound;6.30 and the recorded delivery
costs &pound;2.25.</p>

<p>&#8216;That will be &pound;8.55, please Sir&#8217;.</p>

<p>I hand over a 20 pound note. The lady gives me &pound;8.55 in change, asks me
to put the parcel in Santa&#8217;s overflowing grey sack and prepares for the
next customer.</p>

<p>&#8216;Sorry but I thought you said it was &pound;8.55&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes. That&#8217;s correct.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;But you only gave me &pound;8.55 change&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes. That&#8217;s right&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;But it should be, err, 11 pounds, err, 45 pence&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No. It is 8.55&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;How much are the stamps and the recorded delivery ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;8.55&#8217;</p>

<p>[People are now starting to sigh loudly in the queue ]</p>

<p>&#8216;How much did I give you ?</p>

<p>&#8216;Twenty pounds&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh I see. I am awfully sorry, Sir.&#8217;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Two things that are not immediately obvious about digital radio.</p>

<ol>
<li>Not all DAB stations are national. You may be able to listen to
Capital Radio in Brisbane over the Internet but you can&#8217;t listen to
Capital Radio on a digital radio in Inverness. This is because
&#8216;local&#8217; radio stations are still subject to UK broadcasting
regulations which means they must remain local, even with DAB.
Consequently, the range of radio stations available on DAB isn&#8217;t
(quite) as wide ranging as you might expect.</li>
<li>The sound quality of FM radio is better than DAB. Tune the same
radio station in on FM and DAB, turn up the volume and toggle
between the two. The difference is quite marked. I used to think my
ears? wouldn&#8217;t be able to distinguish between an expensive Bang &amp;
Oulfsen system costing 2,000 GBP and an Alba record player. I was
wrong.</li>
</ol>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A few months ago, I was shocked and amazed to receive an email from
Friends Reunited entitled &#8216;Janet Oldsgate has sent you a private
message&#8217;.</p>

<p>God, I was so excited, I could hardly contain myself. The adrenalin
started flowing, I broke out in a hot sweat and clicked through like I
had never clicked through before.</p>

<p>Oh no. What is my darned password for Friends Reunited ? I looked it up
on the Palm - nothing. I looked in Thunderbird under &#8216;Infrequently used
Web sites&#8217; - nothing. I tried a couple of the usual suspects but no joy.
Then I remembered the password was in fact, &#8216;JOldsgate73!&#8217;. This
password was a deliberate and incredibly secure choice to prevent a
repeat of the unfortunate incident when my wife hacked my Friends
Reunited account and modified my &#8216;Profile&#8217; in an oh so amusing and
hilarious fashion. My, how we laughed.</p>

<p>Now I was logged in and the sense of anticipation grew. I summoned up
the courage and clicked on the inviting &#8216;Your Messages&#8217; icon. Nothing.
Shurely shome mishtake. Refresh. Nothing. I frantically read the online
help and used &#8216;Advanced Search&#8217; to locate all private messages from
&#8216;Janet Oldsgate&#8217; sent directly to me, ever. Absolutely nothing.</p>

<p>Then it slowly dawned on me. There was no private, personal message from
my long lost and first love, Janet Oldsgate. I shouldn&#8217;t have got my
hopes up. I should have known better. I was gullible. I was foolish.</p>

<p>The clues were there all along. Firstly, I went to an all boys grammar
school. Secondly, I do not and have never known anyone called Janet
Oldsgate.</p>

<p>This email was merely an elaborate, cruel hoax (known as phishing) that
ruins peoples&#8217; lives, causing untold distress and angst to its innocent
victims and breaking up happy marriages. And all of this purely in the
name of a CRM marketing campaign to drive more traffic to the Friends
Reunited web site.</p>

<p>And now on the back of the increased traffic, advertising revenue and
click through rates generated by this slightly questionable and
underhand campaign, the founders of Friends Reunited have
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4502550.stm">sold</a> up to ITV for a
cool 120 million GBP.</p>
