  <div class="entry-content"><p>After a promising start, the recent introduction of
<a href="../2007/05/23/sit-back-and-watch-the-money-roll-in">Adsense</a> on this
blog is seriously floundering. I am bitterly disappointed with the
financial returns in June and my wife is seriously doubting the wisdom
of my decision to resign from a highly paid job in IT consultancy in
favour of professional blogging on the kitchen table.</p>

<p>Consequently, after an extraordinary board meeting, I have decided that
desperate measures are necessary. I have cashed in my &pound;12.50
<a href="http://adwords.google.com">Adwords</a> vouchers bundled with my Bluehost
account and launched a brilliant, inspired, marketing campaign aimed at
driving traffic to this site, increasing e-commerce sales and boosting
the click through rate.</p>

<p>So, if you see the following Google advertisement on your travels
through the InterWeb, please be sure to let me know.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/03/09/free-upgrades-from-virgin-media/">upgraded</a>
to a Virgin Media V+ service three months ago. Although I have had some
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/03/23/virgin-media-v-upgrade/">initial</a>
teething
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/05/02/a-day-in-the-life/">problems</a>,
I am pretty satisfied with the V+ service.</p>

<p>The V+ box is a personal video recorder (PVR) similar to the <a href="http://www.sky.com/portal/site/skycom/products/equipment/skyplus">Sky
Plus</a>
service. The V+ box contains a 160GB hard drive which can store 80 hours
of recorded TV programs.</p>

<p>Recording a TV program is very easy. You simply navigate through the 7
day TV guide, select the desired TV program and hit &#8216;Record&#8217;. You get
the option to either record the individual broadcast or the series (if
appropriate).</p>

<p>This is much preferable to finding an old video tape, wondering what is
on it and inadvertently erasing 4 hours of Olympic Gymnastics from
Sydney 2000. The whole operation is so easy, the rest of my family have
mastered it and my only problem now is educating them to erase programs
once viewed. Although the V+ box does have an option to automatically
purge the oldest recordings.</p>

<p>You can pause and rewind live TV too. This is especially useful for
&#8216;Have I Got News For You&#8217; which requires ones full attention to
appreciate all the one-liners and rapid fire jokes. So, if the wife
wants to discuss GCSE options for next year or the mother-in-law calls,
you can simply pause the program, make a cup of tea and resume when the
coast is clear.</p>

<p>I once suspended a football match for 75 minutes and I assume the
duration of &#8216;Delay TV&#8217; is only constrained by the amount of free disk
space. The football match was a excellent example of the benefits of V+.
In the olden days, I would have to record the game on a tape, then wait
until the game had finished before discovering, to my horror, the tape
ended abruptly mid-way through the second half. With &#8216;Delay TV&#8217;, I was
able to resume watching the game (exactly where I left it) while the
actual match was still in progress.</p>

<p>You can rewind and forward at varying speeds (2, 6, 12 and 32) which
makes finding the crucial moment much quicker than tape technology.</p>

<p>The other great feature of the V+ box is that you can watch one program
while simultaneously recording two other channels. You get a warning if
you try to record three overlapping programs. This feature essentially
completely negates the need for the VCR for recording purposes, at
least.</p>

<p>Another useful feature is that if you watch a recorded program, you get
the option to resume viewing from where you left the program which saves
you having to waste time, fast-forwarding to the correct place.</p>

<p>Tapes do have only minor advantage though. You can play them back in any
TV with a VCR while V+ programs can only be played back on the V+ box.
This sounds obvious but my children did once ask &#8216;Why can&#8217;t I watch the
recorded program on the little telly ?&#8217; And when the program in question
is &#8216;Big Brother&#8217; or &#8216;Breast Reductions Gone Badly Wrong&#8217;, they do indeed
have a valid point.</p>

<p>I also assumed the V+ box was intelligent enough to decode signals to
indicate the start and end of a program to cater for the World Snooker
Final overrunning by 3 hours. However, on one occasion, I swear
&#8216;Jonathan Ross&#8217; was replaced by, err, 60 minutes of World Championship
Snooker.</p>

<p>Overall, the introduction of the V+ box has changed the way I view TV. I
tend to select programs I really want to watch, hit &#8216;Record&#8217; and forget
about it. Then, instead of mindlessly channel flicking, I simply scan
the library of recorded programs.</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t comment on the High Definition service as I don&#8217;t have it nor
have I ever transferred recordings from the V+ box to DVD which is also
possible.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Lots of people stumble onto this blog hoping to find technical
information, reviews and images of a black Virgin Media V+ set top box.</p>

<p>I presume this is either husbands trying to convince the wife that the
box will comply with the aesthetics in the lounge or geeks trying to
look at all those connectors on the back.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The Safari Web browser on Macintosh currently accounts for a paltry
4.34% of visits to this blog. It will be interesting to see whether this
figure increases now Apple have
<a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/download/">released</a> a version of Safari
for Windows.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve downloaded Safari and while I like the fonts and appearance, I
probably use too many Firefox add-ons to make the change permanently.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was going to spend Saturday compiling very important
<a href="http://www.dizwell.com/prod/node/805">guidelines</a> for the formatting,
style and content of comments but decided to go and watch the Ladies
final and Men&#8217;s semi-finals at the <a href="http://surbiton.lta.org.uk/">Surbiton
Trophy</a> instead.</p>

<p>I packed a lovely picnic (much to the envy of my neighbours), took a
proper <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/nbrightside/SurbitonTrophy">camera</a>
and enjoyed three matches in the sun:</p>

<ul>
<li>Brenda Schultz McCarthy (36 years old, 6 foot tall) beat Ayumi
Morita (17 years old, 5 foot tall) in three entertaining sets.</li>
<li>The eventual winner, Frenchman Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, edged out the
Australian 4th seed in a tight match featuring many impressive aces.</li>
<li>Dodged for cover as 6&#8217;10&#8221; Croatian, Ivo Karlovic, smashed his way
past a bewildered American, Robbie Kendrick (whose lovely girlfriend
was sitting next to me).</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Welcome to the long delayed and much anticipated issue 2 of &#8217;<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/12/01/murky-depths-of-the-recycle-pool/">Recycle
Pool</a>&#8217;.</p>

<p>We did have a world famous guest writer lined up for this month&#8217;s
edition but, unfortunately, he got cold feet and decided to pull out
at the last minute.</p>

<p>Eddie <a href="http://awads.net/wp/">Awad</a> gets ready to
<a href="http://awads.net/wp/2007/06/03/have-you-heard-of-tumblelogs/">tumble</a>
by sharing interesting snippets from his feeds and travels on the Web.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.digitalteddy.com/Graham/">Graham</a> decides to start a
technical <a href="http://www.digitalteddy.com/techblog/">blog</a> focussed on
three letter acronyms (CRM and SOA). Brave man, particularly as his
wife is expecting a new
<a href="http://www.digitalteddy.com/Graham/2007/06/39_weeks.html">arrival</a> -
imminently.</p>

<p>I wonder if Graham will manage to find the time to mend his RSS feed
and upgrade to the recently released Movable Type
<a href="http://www.sixapart.com/movabletype/news/2007/06/mt4_beta_meet_t.html">V4</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://bclc.wordpress.com/">Stephen</a> confirms something I have
suspected for a long time: &#8216;I was always more of a
<a href="http://bclc.wordpress.com/2007/06/06/i-am-an-anti-christ/">Buzzcock</a>
than a Sex Pistol&#8217;.</p>

<p>Douglas <a href="http://oracledoug.com/serendipity/">Burns</a> conjures up a
superlative
<a href="http://oracledoug.com/serendipity/index.php?/archives/1276-Miracle-Scotland-Database-Forum-and-an-Apology.html">blog</a>,
including photos, summarising the fun and frolics at the Miracle
database forum in Edinburgh. Sounds like my sort of conference.</p>

<p>Kevin <a href="http://feedblog.org/">Burton</a> wonders why the latest
<a href="http://feedblog.org/2007/06/05/the-free-software-foundation-cant-ship-code/">release</a>
of Emacs was six years in the oven. The answer is simple: If it ain&#8217;t
broke, don&#8217;t fix it.</p>

<p>Diamond <a href="http://diamondgeezer.blogspot.com/">Geezer</a> (pseudonym alert)
is lucky enough to be
<a href="http://diamondgeezer.blogspot.com/2007_06_01_archive.html#6926478524741740402">participating</a>
in a trial with access to every BBC program broadcast in the last
week.</p>

<p>Andy <a href="http://oracleandy.wordpress.com/">Campbell</a> makes a welcome
<a href="http://oracleandy.wordpress.com/2007/05/25/back-again/">return</a> to
blogging, migrates from Blogger to Wordpress and adopts the stylish
Drupal theme.</p>

<p>Paul <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/">Stamatiou</a> designs a new
<a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/2007/06/07/new-logo-new-design/">logo</a> for

and could undoubtedly produce something
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_pictures/6722205.stm">better</a> than this
<a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2007/06/actually_its_ju.html">montrosity</a>.</p>

<p>Adam <a href="http://www.adamostrow.com/adam_ostrow/">Ostrow</a> concedes that
further resistance is futile and Google now

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The Siebel 7.8 data model supports different industry applications
(finance and banking, pharmaceutical, sales, telecommunications, energy,
media, motor, public sector, retail) and contains 3,920 tables and even
more indexes.</p>

<p>The results are just in from a Friday afternoon poll to find the most
popular Siebel table:</p>

<ul>
<li>S_ACCELERATOR - invaluable in performance tuning. &#8216;Oh well -
there&#8217;s nothing for it. Now we are simply going to have to load
S_ACCELERATOR&#8217;.</li>
<li>S_CLUSTER_TNT - images of cluster bombs and high explosives but
supposedly related to &#8216;Hospitality&#8217;.</li>
<li>S_AUDIT_ITEM - typically will contain 155 million records of
historic audit data dating back to 2003. No-one knows why this data
is being collected let alone using it.</li>
<li>S_DOCK_INITM_43 - Crazy name, crazy table. Docking table for
Remote.</li>
<li>S_CL_PTCL_LSXM - A real tongue twister related to clinical
protocols.</li>
</ul>


<p>And finally&#8230;
-   S_DISEASE - the clear winner.</p>
