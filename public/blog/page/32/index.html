  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>&#8216;My name is Norman and I am a blogoholic.&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>Two years ago, I
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2005/08/23/firefox-and-thunderbird/">started</a>
this blog purely as an experiment to see what all the fuss was about.</p>

<p>Two years ago, I didn&#8217;t even know what blogging was. I certainly didn&#8217;t
expect that I would still be doing it two years later.</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t anticipate that I would subsequently play with
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/10/10/improving-on-perfection/">themes</a>,
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/10/16/couple-of-useful-wordpress-plugins/">plug-ins</a>,
spend money on a domain,
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/09/30/from-wordpresscom-to-wordpressorg/">migrate</a>
to my own WordPress blog and eventually add
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/05/23/sit-back-and-watch-the-money-roll-in/">Adsense</a>.</p>

<p>During the first year (honeymoon period), I enjoyed monitoring the
traffic statistics for my hosted WordPress blog.</p>

<p>Much to my surprise, I discovered that I actually enjoyed writing.
Initially, I thought I might be capable of creating a technical blog
about <a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/drupal/">Siebel</a> and/or
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/02/20/introduction-to-etl-for-oracle/">Oracle</a>
but I soon discovered that I preferred to post anecdotes from my tedious
life as a IT consultant.</p>

<p>As a consequence of creating the blog, I learned about various blogging
platforms (<a href="http://www.blogger.com/">Blogger</a>,
<a href="http://wordpress.com/">WordPress</a>, <a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/MT/">Movable
Type</a>, <a href="http://drupal.org/">Drupal</a>,
<a href="http://www.typepad.com/">Typepad</a>,
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/01/24/fun-with-habari/">Habari</a>and
Google
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/02/23/google-launches-google-err-page-creator/">Pages</a>)</p>

<p>I also learned about
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2005/12/13/comparison-of-rss-readers/">RSS</a>,
various Web 2.0 tools
(<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2005/12/16/xmas-present-for-bloglines-users/">Bloglines</a>,
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/02/18/resisting-the-lure-of-google-reader/">Reader</a>,
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/05/25/good-vibes-from-netvibes/">Netvibes</a>,
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2005/11/01/comparison-of-blinklist-delicious-and-furl/">Blinklist</a>,
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/05/26/blog-milestone/">Feedburner</a>)
and signed up for various social networks
(<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/07/25/facebook-penetration-of-corporate-america/">Facebook</a>,
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/03/03/linkedincom/">LinkedIn</a>).</p>

<p>Most importantly, I made a handful of new friends that I am still in
regular contact with.</p>

<p>Then one night, I sat in a Dublin hotel room, staring at a pint of
Guiness and mindlessly pressed &#8216;Publish&#8217;. Seconds later, I then
immediately stared at this particular vacuous
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/07/30/how-fast-is-google-blog-search/">post</a>
and thought &#8216;What am I doing ? Why am I doing this ? What is the point
?&#8217;</p>

<p>After two years, I was blogging purely because of the self-imposed
pressure to create content. Content that was valueless, worthless and
pointless.</p>

<p>So, suddenly and spontaneously, I decided to take a break because I
simply couldn&#8217;t be bothered any more. Blogging just wasn&#8217;t fun any more.</p>

<p>After one day, I still checked for comments, scanned the Web server logs
and reviewed my precious
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/06/12/adsense-update/">Adsense</a>
revenue.</p>

<p>After two days, I read my RSS feeds for blog comments and examined my
pretty Google
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/01/06/traffic-report/">Analytics</a>
charts.</p>

<p>After three days, I strongly resisted the urge to check anything.</p>

<p>After five days, I didn&#8217;t do anything. I didn&#8217;t feel obliged to write a
blog article. I didn&#8217;t feel obliged to comment. I didn&#8217;t feel obliged to
scan any of my 167 feeds.</p>

<p>After seven days, I forgot I had a blog. I actually talked to friends
and family. The feeling of liberation was surprising.</p>

<p>After nineteen days, I realised blogging was an addiction. An addiction
that didn&#8217;t fit well with my
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/04/03/david-beckham-and-i/">obsessive</a>
personality.</p>

<p>After twenty eight days, I realised my blog was now two years
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/08/22/blog-anniversary/">old</a> (I
started my blog the day after WordPress
<a href="http://wordpress.com/blog/2007/08/21/2nd-birthday/">launched</a>). An
interesting experiment which had now naturally drawn to a close.</p>

<p>So I was sorely tempted to
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/06/02/half-time-scoreboard/">close</a>
the blog down.</p>

<p>But then <a href="http://oracledoug.com/">Doug</a> said he
<a href="http://oracledoug.com/blog/index.php?/archives/1310-It-Must-Be-Prince.html">liked</a>
&#8217;<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/07/16/planet-earth-by-prince/">Prince</a>&#8217;
so I had to start all over again.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After recent horrific
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/6941879.stm">events</a>,
I was forced to flee the country so I took my family (and a couple of
young hangers-on) for a relaxing break at
<a href="http://www.centerparcs.com/EN/GB/villages/kempervennen">CenterParcs</a>
near
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/02/19/poor-mans-satellite-navigation/">Eindhoven</a>.</p>

<p>For those readers with (young) families, CenterParcs in Holland is very
similar to the setup in the UK except that the prices are lower and
staff are actually friendly and helpful.</p>

<p>For those readers without families, CenterParcs is probably not for you.</p>

<p>Anyway, I have returned refreshed, invigorated and raring to go. I am
currently wading through my backlog of email. Then I will quickly review
the week&#8217;s football news and my Fantasy League team selections, watch
&#8216;Saxondale&#8217; and then normal blogging service will be resumed as I ease
myself gently back into work and scale my ivory tower.</p>

<p>Oh, hang on a minute, the scheduling goddess has helpfully seen fit to
send me straight back to Holland (Rotterdam, to be precise) to spend the
remainder of my Euros so I need to quickly iron a shirt, pack my last
two pairs of clean undergarments, order a taxi and get to Heathrow
Terminal 4 immediately.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Oracle 11g has recently been
<a href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/products/database/oracle11g/index.html">released</a>

to submit their colourful
<a href="http://www.dizwell.com/prod/node/930">screenshots</a> into the &#8216;Oracle 11g

<a href="http://oracledoug.com/serendipity/index.php?/archives/1308-Does-Anyone-Know-When-11g-Will-Be-Released.html">nearly</a>
everyone.</p>

<p>Apologies for the delay but, finally, I am proud to present my paltry,
monochrome
<a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/nbrightside/Blog/photo#5098294974988339106">effort</a>.</p>

<p>I just installed Oracle 11g onto a
<a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/ws/">VMware</a> server running
<a href="http://www.redhat.com/rhel/">Redhat</a> Enterprise Linux 4.0. It actually
took me more time to configure VMware tools and successfully share the
folder staging the distribution than to install and configure Oracle.</p>

<p>The virtual server had a mere 512MB of memory and was hosted on a
Thinkpad T43 laptop with 2GB memory.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Please don&#8217;t tell Norma but, earlier this week, I spent &pound;25 in
<a href="http://www.thefoodplace.co.uk/restaurants/32254/Shagorika+Restaurant+in+Sunderland/">Shagorika</a>.
Such is the life of a sad, lonely IT consultant on a slow Tuesday
night in Sunderland.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, contrary to my expectations, Shagorika turned out to be
a rather mediocre, overpriced Indian restaurant rather than the sordid
den of sexual iniquity I was hoping for.</p>

<p>It took me a while to summon up the courage to cross the threshold. My
nerves were soothed when I was warmly welcomed by a beautiful,
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/02/07/a-night-of-outrageous-flirting-in-copenhagen/">flirtatious</a>
lady who led me by the hand to a cosy waiting area. She gave me a
complimentary drink and asked me to wait a minute while she prepared a
table. A table, not a bed ! How very exotic.</p>

<p>I looked nervously at my surroundings; comfy seats, a well stocked
bar, motoring magazines and stunning ladies peeking out from behind
net curtains. Then my host returned with a warm smile: &#8216;Sir, I are
ready for you now&#8217;. And by now, I was also ready for her. In fact, I
could barely contain my excitement.</p>

<p>My glamorous hostess led me to a table with an immaculate white table
cloth, set for 3 courses with wine glasses. Perplexed, I reluctantly
sat down. I wasn&#8217;t really that hungry so I asked if this foreplay was
absolutely necessary and whether it cost any extra.</p>

<p>My hostess looked a little confused, proffered me a food menu and ran
back to the bar. Then the awful realisation slowly dawned. This was
not a brothel but an Indian restaurant. Words can not describe my
utter embarrassment and how stupid I felt. Particularly, as I had
already stripped down to my vest and boxers.</p>

<p>I immediately and rapidly got dressed again and ordered &#8216;The Chef&#8217;s
Choice&#8217;. Fortunately, I was able to bury my head in the July-August
2007 copy of <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/oramag/oracle/07-jul/index.html">Oracle
Magazine</a>
to avoid the stares of my fellow diners.</p>

<p>Originally, I was going to savour this fine publication with my
partner, in the glowing aftermath of our steamy, breathless sexual
encounter.  Normally, I would smoke a cigarette but a recent change in
the law prohibits that nowadays.</p>

<p>One of my favourite sections in Oracle Magazine is the interviews with
real-life DBA&#8217;s. However I nearly choked on my Prawn Patia as I read
this inappropriate and leading question to M. K Rizwan:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;What&#8217;s your favourite tool or technique on the job ?&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>I am now frantically leafing through my 157 back issues to see
precisely how <a href="http://www.oracle-base.com/blog/">Tim</a> and
<a href="http://oracledoug.com/serendipity/">Doug</a> replied to this question.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Two weeks ago, I sat in the business lounge at Newcastle airport. I
chose a desk right in the corner away from everyone else because I am
like that.</p>

<p>Inevitably, the lounge filled up with business types trying to impress
everyone else by speaking loudly on their slimline toy phones.</p>

<p>A gentleman came and sat down next to me. He fetched an orange juice and
two packets of delicious <a href="http://www.kettlefoods.co.uk/site/HomePage.do?id=501.54">Kettle
Chips</a> (Sea
Salt with crushed black peppercorns and Mature Cheddar and Chives) to
occupy himself for the next 25 minutes.</p>

<p>Now Kettle Chips are very tasty and I am quite partial to a packet
myself but when you are trying to concentrate and not partaking, the act
of ripping open the packet(s) and noisily crunching crisp after crisp is
incredibly irritating.</p>

<p>Finally, the second packet was exhausted. All the crumbs at the bottom
had been shoveled down his greedy throat. Peace at last.</p>

<p>Peace until he got up from his chair and fetched another two packets.
Not one but another two.</p>

<p>Now I know that food and drink are complimentary in the business lounge,
but, for God&#8217;s sake, Kettle Chips simply aren&#8217;t exactly a delicacy that
you never get at home.</p>

<p>This afternoon, I find myself in the same business lounge, with a new
immediate neighbour for company. Incredibly, he has also just noisily
munched his way through two packets of Kettle Chips.</p>

<p>Jesus Christ - he has just got up and and returned with another two
packets (Salsa Mesquite and Sea Salt &amp; Balsamic Vinegar).</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve had enough. I can&#8217;t take any more without saying anything I regret.</p>

<p>I am now going to show some solidarity with the man in the street and
sit in an empty departure lounge with no flight until next Monday.</p>

<p>As far away from everyone else, and Kettle Chips, as I can possibly get.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was interested to
<a href="http://blogs.technet.com/seanearp/archive/2007/07/21/how-many-microsoft-employees-does-it-take-to.aspx">read</a>
that Microsoft have over 17,597 employees registered on
<a href="http://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a> out of a total of 70,000 employees.</p>

<p>I thought I would try to discover how other leading IT companies
compared, including my own. The staff numbers come from Google
<a href="http://finance.google.com/" title="Finance">Finance</a> and the rounding errors
come from me.</p>

<p>The following Facebook networks are only open to company employees with
a valid email address although, obviously, a better metric would have
been some measure of recent activity.</p>

<hr />

<p>  Company     Employees   Facebook   FB factor (%)
  Google      10,674      5,545      51.9
  Yahoo!      11,400      3,911      34.3
  Microsoft   71,000      17,980     25.3
  Sun         14,000      2,942      21.0
  IBM         355,766     23,400     6.6
  Oracle      74,674      4,280      5.7
  SAP         41,919      2,300      5.4
  HP          186,000     9,742      5.2
  Intel       90,300      4,219      4.7</p>

<hr />

<p>Inevitably, I guess - Google lead the way (again) but I was surprised to
see that Sun Microsystems have a significant proportion of Facebook
members.</p>

<p>IBM were slightly lower than I expected until I remembered that half
their 350,000 employees are
<a href="http://andypiper.wordpress.com/2007/01/26/second-life-is-work/">busy</a>
building fantasy worlds in Second Life. No wonder I can&#8217;t get spare
parts for my Thinkpad.</p>

<p>Nice to see Oracle positioned just ahead of SAP after recent
<a href="http://www.web-strategist.com/blog/2007/04/27/dear-oracle-bloggers-host-a-lunch-20/" title="discussions">discussions</a>
about the companies&#8217; respective contributions and reputation in the Web
2.0 community.</p>

<p>I still have wildly oscillating feelings about Facebook; on one hand, a
walled garden, puerile, teenage and gimmicky but undoubtedly an
insidious, strangely compulsive and probably important platform.</p>

<p>PS. For example, I have just seen the immortal words &#8216;Andy and Mark
Burgess (The Chameleons) are now friends&#8217;. Superb.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today, a gentleman approached me and politely asked if he could ask me a
question.</p>

<p>Normally, this dialog is a little more protracted and goes as follows:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;Excuse me. Is your name Norman Brightside ?&#8217;
&#8216;Yes.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Do you work for Siebel ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes.&#8217; (although strictly I work for Oracle on the Siebel CRM product)</p>

<p>&#8216;Are you from Expert Services ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Do you mind if I ask you a quick question ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Not at all. Fire away.&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>Anyway, what was unusual and striking about this approach was the fact
the gentleman was carrying a Reporters Notebook and a pen.</p>

<p>When we sat down to discuss the various strategies for gathering,
refreshing and (in obtuse cases), dropping statistics on objects in the
Siebel schema, he actually asked me if I minded pausing briefly while he
wrote things down.</p>

<p>I am not very clever. I am always writing things down mainly to avoid
forgetting them. I tend to gather a lot of data when I visit a customer.
Some of it is important, some of it is not. At first, it is not always
obvious which is which.</p>

<p>As I usually have to produce a formal report, I find it necessary and
useful to jot things down. My jottings are normally in a text file which
I take away with me as input into the report. This is another reason I
almost always exclusively use SQL*Plus to script test cases and take
away a wad of spool files on a memory stick.</p>

<p>I am not overly organised. Sometimes, I may have a pristine pad of A4
paper but more often I am scribbling on the reverse of my flight/hotel
itinerary or a Google map.</p>

<p>If I am talking to a Siebel administrator, project manager, Oracle DBA,
in a meeting or a conference call or just chatting with an end user, I
will ensure I have a piece of paper available. Just to write things
down.</p>

<p>However, the fact I actually noticed this gentleman was equipped with a
pen and paper for our brief chat and also made notes and jottings,
merely served to reinforce how rare this seemingly obvious and eminently
sensible practice is.</p>

<p>Or am I just mixing in the wrong circles ?</p>
