  <div class="entry-content"><p>Watching &#8216;World Cup Goals Galore&#8217; on BBC3 which also has a fantastic
music soundtrack. Some great goals and memories.</p>

<p>Although I get thoroughly sick of the media hype and the endless
analysis, you can&#8217;t help but get excited about the World Cup now.</p>

<p>It looks like Rooney may yet be named in the squad. It doesn&#8217;t look like
Carrick will play the &#8216;holding role&#8217; but Carragher might. Let&#8217;s just
hope he can produce a forward pass and that he doesn&#8217;t keel over with
cramp in extra time.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In April 2002, I got off my barstool and actually went to see a
Manchester United game. The fixture was at Upton Park and I was in the
Bobby Moore stand as I was the guest of a West Ham member.</p>

<p>United won an very entertaining game 5-3 and Beckham scored a fantastic
goal (lob from outside the box). All of this made it very hard to keep
my mouth shut.</p>

<p>Ironically, I was stood (sorry - sitting) just 10 yards from the away
support and enjoyed all the chants and banter between the two sets of
supporters.</p>

<p>Depending on the score and the mood, the West Ham fans usually replied
to the United chants with some witty retort, hurled some abuse or just
stood in silence.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the chant that provoked by far the biggest reaction was
when United chanted &#8216;Argentina, Argentina&#8217; at the England (sorry - West
Ham) supporters.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Imagine trying to hold a conversation with someone who never completed
their sentences. Irritating, eh ?</p>

<p>I used to smile when people like Robert
<a href="http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/">Scoble</a> (and other well respected
bloggers) used to get all heated and uptight in a raging controversy
about a subject as innocuous as the thorny issue of
<a href="http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/2005/12/18/best-argument-against-partial-feeds-yet/">partial</a>
versus full RSS feeds.</p>

<p>I used to think &#8216;Crikey. Aren&#8217;t there more serious things in life to
worry about ?&#8217; (football and music to name just two).</p>

<p>But now I agree that partial feeds are indeed the work of the devil.
Partial feeds seem to defeat the whole point of RSS and I am growing to
hate that tantalising &#8216;&#8230;&#8217;</p>

<p>I have configured Netvibes which looks excellent and is rapidly becoming
my one stop home page, RSS reader, search engine, portal, email,
calendar, calculator, everything.</p>

<p>Everything that is apart from being able to read blogs by people who
insist on using partial RSS feeds.</p>

<p>People who insist on publishing partial feeds (step forward all you
Oracle bloggers) are now forcing me to click another button in order to
read their articles in all their glory.</p>

<p>Another click isn&#8217;t the end of the world but please remember that I am
very lazy. It is also a context switch into another application
(browser) when Netvibes is perfectly able of displaying the content.</p>

<p>I can understand commercial sites using partial feeds as they rely on
advertising revenue so they have an interest in pulling people to the
actual site. However for personal bloggers just writing for fun, I don&#8217;t
see the point.</p>

<p>Well, actually, of course, I do see the point. Some personal bloggers
are not just doing it purely for fun. They are doing it to see if what
they are writing is actually of interest to anybody and whether anyone
is watching.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s why they publish partial feeds, forcing the interested reader
along to the site and incrementing the precious stat counter by one.</p>

<p>When I recently plugged this blog into a statistics counter, I toyed
with killing my Feedburner feed (WordPress has a perfectly good feed)
and converting to a partial RSS feed. Both of these changes would force
people to my site, increase my traffic and boost my ego.</p>

<p>However, I decided against because some people may prefer Feedburner
(for whatever reason) and other readers may prefer to read my words from
within their favoured RSS reader without that extra click.</p>

<p>So I decided not to risk antagonising my audience (of two) and to leave
well alone.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A Gartner/IDC <a href="http://news.zdnet.com/2100-3513_22-6077017.html">report</a>
summarising the state of the database market in 2005 contains some
interesting nuggets of information.</p>

<p>The database market is still growing at 9.4% (which surprised me a
little).</p>

<p>OpenSource databases account for less than 1% of the market but are
growing fast (47%).</p>

<p>The Linux platform (thanks mainly to Oracle) is showing the strongest
growth (84%).</p>

<p>Despite these two statements of fact, Oracle are not perturbed by the
threat of OpenSource (pass the salt cellar).</p>

<p>Market share:</p>

<ol>
<li>Oracle - 44.6%</li>
<li>IBM - 21.4%</li>
<li>Microsoft - 16.8%</li>
<li>OpenSource (MySQL, Ingres) - 1%</li>
