  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently, I was watching my daughter doing some homework on the PC and
noticed that she was listening to music from a radio stream over the
Internet, talking to her friends in real-time using Instant Messenger,
uploading photos of her holiday to her Web page, ripping music from a CD
ready to copy on to an MP3 player and integrating an chart from Excel
spreadsheet into a Word document.</p>

<p>A couple of things struck me:-</p>

<ul>
<li>Females are indeed better at multi-tasking than men.</li>
<li>Where was the homework ?</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There was an interesting program on ITV last night called <a href="http://www.itn-theshot.com/">The Shot
That Shook The World</a> about photographs
of historic moments.</p>

<h2>9/11</h2>

<p>Mesmeric, tragic, horrific and yet somehow those images are always
compelling. I guess this was the JFK moment for my generation where
everyone can remember exactly where they were and what they were
doing.</p>

<p>I was working for a small Internet company and a colleague was idly
surfing and memorably announced &#8216;A plane has just hit the World Trade
Centre&#8217;. The internet soon ground to a halt and we watched the tragedy
unfold on portable TV in disbelief.</p>

<p>I remember early editions of an English newspaper carried photographs
of two people holding hands jumping to their deaths that were
subsequently pulled when they realised that this was real people in
real life with real mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters, sons and
daughters.</p>

<h2>Sport</h2>

<p>The Brazil goal against Italy in the 1970 World Cup. My favourite goal
of all time. The way Pele flicks the ball to Carlos Alberto. Pure art.</p>

<h2>Moon Landing (1969)</h2>

<p>I remember the whole school being assembled in the hall to watch these
grainy images on a black and white TV.</p>

<h2>Challenger disaster</h2>

<p>I visited the Kennedy Centre a few years ago and there is a nice,
simple, understated black
<a href="http://www.kennedyspacecenter.com/visitKSC/attractions/memorial.asp">memorial</a>
to all the astronauts who have lost their lives during the space
program. Ironically, one was killed in a car crash.</p>

<h2>Concorde crash</h2>

<p>Interesting as this footage was shot by a member of the public from a
moving car. This is much more prevalent now with the widespread use
camera phones which provided almost immediate access to photos of the
London bombings in July 2005.</p>

<h2>Hillsborough</h2>

<p>This wasn&#8217;t actually featured but those photographs on the front page
of The Independent newspaper of ordinary people dying, squashed
against the railings in the Leppings Lane terrace at a football match
in Sheffield had a big effect on me.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just submitted my tax return online which was pretty painless and
quick.  On the final page, I entered some additional information with
a minor query. When I submitted the form, there was a data validation
error.  When I read the error message more carefully, I realised that
the carriage return character is not allowed in the free form text box
so I removed all of them. However, the form was still rejected until I
realised that the question mark character &#8216;?&#8217; is also not permitted.</p>

<p>So, rather like Tom Kyte, the Inland Revenue is not currently
accepting questions.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just bought my daughter a cheap MP3 player. Small, lightweight, silver
and cheaper than an iPod. We connected it to the PC using the USB
cable.  The MP3 device simply appears as an additional disk drive so I
quickly show my daughter how to copy one song from &#8216;My Music&#8217; onto the
player and she does the rest. Within 5 minutes, she is happy and
listening to music on her new toy !</p>

<p>This prompted me to finally get around to something I wanted to do for
a while - to copy some new music onto my aging Sony MiniDisc
Walkman. This is slightly larger and heavier than the MP3 player but
still looks (and sounds) pretty good.</p>

<p>Anyway, it&#8217;s been a while since I transferred any music. So long in
fact, that my hard disk on the PC died and has been replaced.
Consequently the Sony OpenMG program needed to transfer music onto the
Walkman is not installed any more and I can&#8217;t easily locate the
original CD. So I go to the Sony web site to download the
software. Sony&#8217;s website is actually a confusing mess of sites
distributed worldwide.  Sony make some great technology products but
their Web sites are a truly bizarre mixture of styles and content. One
even insisted I download IE 5.5 (I was using Firefox).</p>

<p>Eventually I discover the OpenMG software has been upgraded, revamped
and is now called SonicStage. I download and and install the program,
conquer the non-intuitive user interface and am finally poised to
press the button to finally transfer two CD&#8217;s in WMA format to the
Sony device.</p>

<p>However SonicStage won&#8217;t let me because of copyright protection so I
have to rip the CD&#8217;s again using SonicStage and finally tranfer the
music to the MD Walkman.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s fine for two CD&#8217;s but I am hardly going to re-record my other
124 CD&#8217;s into Sony&#8217;s ATRAC format.</p>

<p>Sometimes, less is more.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well I was finally forced to join the masses and download
<a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/">Firefox</a> and ditch Internet
Explorer.  Yes - my nickname is &#8216;Johnny Come Lately&#8217;.</p>

<p>I had been aware of the Firefox browser for a while but my previous
experience was with a very early version of Mozilla that had a few
problems with a couple of the Web sites I was using at the time.</p>

<p>The final straw came that pushed me over the edge was when my children
downloaded some invasive spyware that commandeered the Web browser and
implanted a &#8216;Web Search&#8217; toolbar. As you can not deconfigure this
toolbar without completely removing the product, I found myself
uninstalling it, my kids would reinstall it for some whizzy colourful
cursors. Repeat ad infinitum. Life is simply too short.</p>

<p>The immediate benefit of Firefox is the tabbed browsing which lets you
keep multiple Web sites open and visible at the same time. After you
have used this feature for a while, it is indispensible and you wonder
how you ever lived without it.</p>

<p>Then I experimented with RSS feeds from the BBC and elsewhere. Instead
of having to periodically check a range of Web sites for any new
content, I wanted automatic notification of when new content was
available. However, while the &#8216;Live bookmarks&#8217; feature in Firefox was
pretty good, I really wanted something like a pseudo newsgroup that
would list new articles on a Website just like articles in a newsgroup.
So, I downloaded <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/thunderbird/">Thunderbird</a>
which seamlessly and painlessly converted all my email messages and
contacts from Outlook Express and I was finished.</p>

<p>I have been using Firefox for a week now and so far, the only Web sites
that I have encountered problems with is Sony&#8217;s SonicStage download page
(which insists on Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.0) and Blueyonder&#8217;s
selfcare home page (which is gloriously blank). However, this probably
says more about the authors of these Web sites rather than any
deficiencies in Firefox.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Returned from holiday to find correspondence lying on my doorstep from
two internet companies. Both were big names and continually in the news
during the internet boom in 1999.</p>

<p>Firstly, two cheques resulting from travelocity&#8217;s takeover of
lastminute.com. Back in 2000, I applied to buy shares in lastminute.com
for me, my wife, my auntie and my dog. Thankfully, the share offering
was massively oversubscribed and I only received the minimum allocation
which reduced my subsequent losses five years later. In fact, the
lastminute takeover was very timely as I had two separate, small
shareholdings which I was stuck with as dealing costs would have
swallowed up most of the proceeds.</p>

<p>Secondly, a thick wad of legalese all the way from the United States of
America regarding a class action by shareholders (and corporate lawyers)
against Amazon. I couldn&#8217;t be bothered to read all the twenty seven
pages of small print but the gist appeared to be that people bought
shares expecting to become dollar millionaires overnight and,
unsurprisingly, were bitterly disappointed when this failed to
materialise. Remember, people, the price of shares can go down as well
as up. If you want to become a dollar millionaire, don&#8217;t buy shares
become a corporate lawyer.</p>
