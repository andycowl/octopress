  <div class="entry-content"><p>In the 1980&#8217;s, some ladies chose to wear dark trouser suits and blouses
in an effort to match their male counterparts in the workplace. This fad
was known as &#8217;<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/2815859.stm">power
dressing</a>&#8217;.</p>

<p>One of my least favourite films is &#8216;What Women Want&#8217; starring Mel
Gibson. I also thought Kurt Cobain looked pretty cool in a
<a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=2UuZ848W51A">dress</a> and Dave Grohl managed
to carry off wearing a bra (and a baseball cap) without looking
ridiculous.</p>

<p>So, in the interests of equality and as a concerted effort to break down
social and gender stereotyping, I decided to visit a client today
wearing a dress. It started out pretty well with several wolf-whistles
from builders on the way to the station.</p>

<p>However, it simply took me an age to arrange everything in the right
place to get my photograph taken for my visitors pass and people tended
to stare at me, look distractedly out of the window and avoid eye
contact (more than usual).</p>

<p>The whole exercise was a very interesting experiment but, suffice to
say, one that won&#8217;t be repeated.</p>

<p>The disciplinary hearing is on Friday afternoon which also means I will
miss the Christmas party. Sigh.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>How the big clubs approach the problem&#8230;</p>

<p>Manchester United - Alex Ferguson chooses to invite Jose Mourinho to the
boardroom to share a bottle of expensive Portugese wine. Pointedly
applaud United fans who chant &#8216;Your coat&#8217;s from Matalan&#8217; on the way to
the tunnel. Then shut up and assemble a team that actually looks capable
of challenging Chelsea.</p>

<p>Liverpool - Appeal to the House of Lords, the Citizen&#8217;s Advice Bureau
and the European Court of Human Rights after Mourinho has the audacity
and bare faced cheek to put his finger to his
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/league_cup/4312567.stm">mouth</a>
after a Chelsea goal in the Carling Cup Final. Hold a annual 5 minute
silence at Anfield for all those fans suffering post traumatic stress
disorder as a consequence.</p>

<p>Arsenal - Arsene

is so busy
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/a/arsenal/6187899.stm">abusing</a>

mind games. Go to the back of the class.</p>

<p>Everton - Take legal

after Mourinho accuses your centre forward of falling over a little too
easily. Go running to your mummy in tears when this fails and everyone
laughs at you.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Tuesday - An empty black hold-all crashes to the floor from its
precarious position on top of the wardrobe alongside miscellaneous
Christmas packages.</p>

<p>Wednesday - A full length mirror falls and rotates through 180&#8217; from
being propped up against the fireplace and sandwiched against a box of
files. I tried to reproduce the path the mirror must have taken but
there simply isn&#8217;t enough room for the mirror to have fallen the way it
did.</p>

<p>Thursday - A digital cordless phone in the kitchen spontaneously
develops a faulty connection on the rocker switch and beeps incessantly.
Yet another interrupted night&#8217;s sleep.</p>

<p>Even more spooky, each occurrence happened at 03:58 precisely.</p>

<p>Time to call Yvette Fielding and get the <a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/01/27/most-haunted-2/">Most

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Jonathan <a href="http://jonathanlewis.wordpress.com/">Lewis</a> poses a very
interesting
<a href="http://jonathanlewis.wordpress.com/2006/12/09/how-many-ways/">question</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Have you ever wondered how hard the optimizer has to work to produce a
plan ?</p></blockquote>

<p>Well actually Jonathan, curiously enough I have. Many times, in fact.</p>

<p>Siebel 7.7 (released in 2004) was the first version of Siebel to support
the Oracle cost based optimizer (CBO) and pleased a lot of demanding
Oracle DBA&#8217;s who looked contemptuously on the 10 year old rule based
optimizer (RBO) technology and had long petitioned Siebel to finally add
support for CBO to improve performance, support table partitioning,
parallel query, bitmap indexes and lots of other features they wanted to
use (i.e learn about).</p>

<p>Inevitably, this major architecture change brought improvements in
performance and was generally welcomed by new customers. However, the
use of CBO also introduced some new issues for existing, long-standing
Siebel customers who upgraded to 7.7 from previous releases.</p>

<p>For example, if you dug very deep with tkprof and ran comparative tests,
it was common to observe that parse times were increased with CBO. This
was because versions of Siebel prior to 7.7 used the rule based
optimizer which follows a fixed set of, 15, err, rules to determine the
query plan to be used. Consequently, parsing in RBO is deterministic and
relatively quick.</p>

<p>Academics proved that it was actually possible for a well-trained monkey
to learn and recite the 15 rules and accurately predict the query plan
that Oracle will select. Clever Siebel 2000 developers discovered they
could influence the chosen query plan by reciting magic incantations,
altering search specifications, sacrificing lambs, nullifying the use of
unhelpful indexes and even modifying the ordering of WHERE clauses in
the SQL statements.</p>

<p>However. as Siebel finally moved into the 1990&#8217;s and embraced CBO,
things suddenly became very different. The strategy for CBO is to simply
give the optimizer as much data as possible so the optimizer can make
the &#8216;best&#8217; decision regardless. Talented Siebel developers everywhere
quaked in their boots and now sacrificed their lambs, praying for a
contract renewal.</p>

<p>So whenever Siebel customers complained to me that parse times were too
high, I was often tempted to ask them:-</p>

<p>&#8216;How many pages of A4 did it take to print out this problematic query
with the high parse time ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Err, 16.&#8217; &#8216;How many tables are joined ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Well, err, 38.&#8217; &#8216;And how many outer joins are in this query ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Well, err, 12.&#8217; &#8216;How many indexes are defined on those 38 tables ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Well, err, 189 ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;So, if I gave you detailed statistics on those 38 tables together with
even more statistics on those 189 indexes together with frequency
histograms of all of the columns involved, how long would it take you to
parse that query and tell me the best query plan to return the data as
quickly as possible ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Well, err, I&#8217;m not sure&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;And how long do you think it would it take you to write a computer
program to crunch all that data and return the best query plan ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Well, err, I really don&#8217;t know&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;So do you still think that 3.4 seconds is really too long to parse this
statement for the first time and sub-second thereafter ?&#8217;.</p>

<p>&#8216;Well, err no, I guess not&#8217;.</p>

<p>Now I am lucky enough to work for Oracle, I have visibility to a wide
variety of complicated CBO related bugs including detailed analysis from
Technical Support and Engineering of 10053 trace files.</p>

<p>Consequently, I have nothing but complete respect for the software
engineers who develop, maintain, fix and seek to improve the Oracle cost
based optimizer.</p>

<p>[ I can thoroughly recommend Jonathan Lewis&#8217;
<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Cost-Based-Oracle-Fundamentals-Experts/dp/1590596366/sr=8-1/qid=1165872049/ref=sr_1_1/203-2869917-8143900?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books">book</a>
as an excellent introduction with plenty of examples to illustrate how
the CBO works. ]</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The couple in front of me at the (not so very) fast baggage drop had an
overnight bag and two carrier bags containing bottles of whiskey and
cigarettes. Much to my surprise, they expressed a wish to check the
carrier bags into the hold and take the hold-all on board.</p>

<p>The lady behind the desk explained that this wouldn&#8217;t be possible or
really sensible.</p>

<p>Much to my surprise (and that of the lady from BMI), a heated exchange
then took place where the lady appeared to claim, in no uncertain terms,
that she &#8216;knew this would happen&#8217; and this mess was &#8216;all your fault.&#8217;</p>

<p>To my amazement, they proceeded to unpack the hold-all and put the
contents in the carrier bags. I quickly averted my gaze in case the
lady&#8217;s underwear was going to be exhibited. The couple then placed their
&#8216;luggage&#8217; into the carrier bags and wrapped the bottles in the hold-all.</p>

<p>Triumphantly, they placed the hold-all on the conveyor belt and stated:
&#8216;Just one bag for the hold, please.&#8217;</p>

<p>No need to ask &#8216;Did you pack this bag yourself ?&#8217;</p>

<p>Weird.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was convinced I had my address book quadruple-mirrored (Thunderbird,
Palm, Gmail and ScheduleWorld) secured on resilient disk storage using
RAID-5 with offsite backups.</p>

<p>However, when I came to start writing my Christmas cards, this
assumption proved be to false. I think something must have gone awry
during my disaster recovery testing in the summer.</p>

<p>Anyway, if you can remember aunties name, street name and town, you can
obtain the correct postcode from the <a href="http://www.royalmail.com/portal/rm/postcodefinder?catId=400145">Royal
Mail</a>.</p>

<p>Then, armed with the full postal address, you can (probably) obtain her
phone number from <a href="http://www.thephonebook.bt.com/publisha.content/en/find/residential/residential_numbers.publisha?com.bea.event.type=linkclick&amp;oLName=link.searchresults&amp;oLDesc=KB_687">British
Telecom</a>
so you can thank her for the thoughtful present in January.</p>

<p>Finally, if you bribe a call centre employee (or root around in the bins
outside a major UK bank), you can also obtain her bank and credit card
details to find out how much she actually spent on you this year.</p>
