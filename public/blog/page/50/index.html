  <div class="entry-content"><p>Penny Coates is an overpaid idiot who thinks East Midlands Airport
should be <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/6220118.stm">renamed</a>
&#8216;East Midlands Airport - Nottingham, Leicester, Derby.&#8217;</p>

<p>Personally, I think &#8216;Brian Clough Airport&#8217; would be better because
Cloughie is primarily associated with Nottingham, had links with Derby
and also occasionally enjoyed a curry and a few pints in Leicester.</p>

<p>Also, the proposed name will mean that most people will miss their
flights. By the time you&#8217;ve told the taxi driver your destination, the
plane will be on the runway.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I bought my children an advent calendar each to initiate the Christmas
celebrations (and shut them up).</p>

<p>As soon as my son got home from the supermarket, he eagerly ripped open
the little door panel for 1 December and wolfed down the chocolate.</p>

<p>As it was already the 3rd of December, I gently enquired whether I might
be allowed to sample the delicious chocolate for the 2nd December. He
agreed because he truly loves his father - &#8216;Yes. Go on then although
they do taste a bit funny&#8217;.</p>

<p>I looked at the lovely advent calendar, admiring the wonderful Christmas
scenes.</p>

<p>Then I noticed it. Top left corner. In small print. Good Boy Advent
Calendar. For <a href="http://www.ukpetsupplies.com/detail.aspx?ID=1775">Dogs</a>.</p>

<p>Happy Christmas, son.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Absolutely nobody writes in to ask: &#8216;Norman - what fabulous, chart
topping, pop-tastic long playing records are on your Christmas list this
Yuletide ?&#8217;</p>

<p>\1. Snow Patrol - <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Eyes-Open-Snow-Patrol/dp/B000F5GJY6/sr=1-1/qid=1164980517/ref=sr_1_1/203-2869917-8143900?ie=UTF8&amp;s=music">Eyes
Open</a></p>

<p>Pleasant enough. Why change a winning formula ? (see also R.E.M). Minor
obsession with open and shut (Eyes Open, Open Your Eyes, Hands Open,
Shut Your Eyes) and a nice contribution from <del>Kate Bush</del> Martha
Wainwright on &#8216;Set The Fire To The Third Bar&#8217;.</p>

<p>\2. The Killers - <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Sams-Town-Killers/dp/B000HDR9NG/sr=8-1/qid=1164980452/ref=pd_ka_1/203-2869917-8143900?ie=UTF8&amp;s=music">Sam&#8217;s
Town</a></p>

<p>An unbelievable disappointment. The warning signs were all there but I
chose to ignore them; PH&#8217;s disparaging
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/09/11/the-killers/#comment-862">comments</a>,
Brandon referring to this as The Killers &#8216;concept album&#8217;, the facial
hair, the best music
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/02/23/probably-the-best-music-review-in-the-world/">reviewer</a>
in the world likening &#8216;When You Were Young&#8217; to Meatloaf.</p>

<p>Even diehard fans advocate giving it time and a few listens. But with
the possible exception of the title track, I can&#8217;t. What had the
potential (&#8216;All The Pretty Faces&#8217;) to be absolutely superb is simply
tedious beyond belief and irritating.</p>

<p>\3. Nirvana - <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Utero-Nirvana/dp/B0000072KY/sr=1-1/qid=1164985516/ref=sr_1_1/203-2869917-8143900?ie=UTF8&amp;s=music">In
Utero</a>.</p>

<p>More then 10 years old but still sounds fresh and is vastly underrated.
Required listening to cleanse oneself after the above torture.</p>

<p>&#8216;Serve The Servants, Heart Shaped Box, Rape Me, Radio Friendly Unit
Shifter, Frances Farmer, Dumb, Pennyroyal Tea&#8217;. Click &#8216;Repeat&#8217;. Turn
volume up.</p>

<p>I must own up and admit that I only recently discovered there are hidden
<a href="http://www.completenirvana.co.uk/php/faq/#15">tracks</a> in the minutes of
silence in the run off. Oh the shame.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Good evening. My name is &#8216;Google Bot&#8217;. It was a difficult (N-P complete)
and very time consuming task to decide on the precise content for this
article. After all, I have crawled 2.6 billion pages in the last seven
days so I am a little tired. However, here is the pick of the
blogosphere for November.</p>

<p>Oracle release 10.2.0.3 patch set (currently available on Linux only).
This release includes several fixes related to the cost based optimizer.
Siebel 7.8 customers using Oracle 10g should note the following bug
fixes:</p>

<ul>
<li>4370351 - High parse CPU (in qksfroInit) for large queries</li>
<li>4573396 - CBO does not account for chained rows</li>
<li>4711525 - Parsing of bitmapped plans can be slow</li>
<li>4772145 - Gathering statistics on large indexes is slow</li>
</ul>


<p>Tom <a href="http://tkyte.blogspot.com/">Kyte</a> quietly releases a revamped
version of the popular
<a href="http://govt.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=100:1:3621840761986277">AskTom</a>
site. The new version is written in Apex and has a clean, fresh
interface and looks very professional.</p>

<p>Over on his blog, Tom also writes an interesting
<a href="http://tkyte.blogspot.com/2006/11/see-you-just-cannot-make-this-stuff-up.html">article</a>
that really should have been titled
&#8217;<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/11/23/ycnmiu-4/">YCNMIU</a>&#8217;.</p>

<p>Doug <a href="http://oracledoug.com/serendipity/">Burns</a> takes steps to
re-establish his technical credentials by
<a href="http://oracledoug.com/serendipity/index.php?/archives/1140-A-Sad-Announcement.html">ejecting</a>
the cuddly toys from his blog and ceaselessly
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/markrittman/299646683/in/set-72157594380437598/">networking</a>
at UKOUG in an attempt to win friends and influence people. Inside
sources confirm that Doug took this radical action after the soft toys
were attracting more comments than Doug&#8217;s technical white papers on
parallelism.</p>

<p>Brian the Footballer emailed to say the toys were very upset and
annoyed. Worse, Doug sentenced them to using Blogger Beta when he had a
beautiful WordPress placeholder blog ready and waiting. Or he did, until
he spitefully went and <a href="http://oracledoug.wordpress.com/">deleted</a> it.</p>

<p>This sequence of developments all makes sense when Doug
<a href="http://oracledoug.com/serendipity/index.php?/archives/1149-Reverse-Job-Advert.html">announces</a>
he has spurned a lucrative contract renewal and will be looking for a
new role in 2007. Neighbours report hammering and expletives emanating
from Doug&#8217;s shed. Our spies in Scotland claim Burns is preparing for a
spell on the bench by carving one by hand. Made of solid oak.</p>

<p>Tim <a href="http://www.oracle-base.com/blog/">Hall</a> has started a bulc-koob.
This is like a <a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/11/28/testing-debut-at-book-club/">book
club</a>
but works in reverse. Most book clubs have 12 members and read 1 book a
month. Tim&#8217;s variation has 1 member and reads 12 books a month -
<a href="http://www.oracle-base.com/blog/2006/11/23/the-blood-canticle/">all</a>
<a href="http://www.oracle-base.com/blog/2006/11/20/blackwood-farm/">about</a>
<a href="http://www.oracle-base.com/blog/2006/11/25/pandora/">vampires</a>. Oracle
sources are a little worried about Tim. Apparently at UKOUG, he was
always dressed in
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/markrittman/299646279/in/set-72157594380437598/">black</a>
and only came out at night. He also looked a little pale and was never
seen without a glass of cranberry juice.</p>

<p>At last. An Oracle blogger with taste in
<a href="http://radiofreetooting.blogspot.com/2006/12/repetition.html">music</a>.
Unfortunately, Andrew <a href="http://radiofreetooting.blogspot.com/">Clarke</a>
spoiled the article with some dry technical content but never mind.
Enquiring minds still want to know whether Andrew ever did get reunited
with his
<a href="http://radiofreetooting.blogspot.com/2006/11/ukoug-2006-day-one.html">lost</a>
socks and underpants though.</p>

<p>Ever noticed how plumbers always have horrible, dated, unfashionable
bathrooms with dripping taps. Well Mark
<a href="http://www.rittman.net/">Rittman</a> is a well respected consultant on all
things to do with Oracle and Business Intelligence. However, Mark
naively assumed his hosting provider might actually backup his data for
10 quid a month but no. Unbelievably, they managed to
<a href="http://www.rittman.net/2006/11/15/wheres-everything-gone/">lose</a> his
data. All of it. 700 articles. And no, he didn&#8217;t have a backup.
Thankfully, all articles was restored from various sources. Some people
would do anything (12 hours of mindless cut/paste) to get back on his
blog roll.</p>

<p>And finally, Jeff <a href="http://marist89.blogspot.com/">Hunter</a> inadvertently
starts a frank
<a href="http://marist89.blogspot.com/2006/11/where-am-i-deploying-mysql-revisited.html">exchange</a>
of views with Sheeri <a href="http://sheeri.net/">Kritzer</a> over the pros and
cons of mySQL. Ah - just like the good old days. The flame wars on
Usenet, watered down and transferred to the blogosphere.</p>

<p>Peace, love, empathy.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>London, near England. 1 December 2006</p>

<p>Brightside Productions proudly announce the launch &#8216;From The Murky
Depths Of The Recycle Pool.&#8217;</p>

<p>This innovative blog series will round up the latest happenings from
the blogosphere with a sideways glance at Oracle. The blog will
feature a variety of exciting formats including articles, podcasts,
video blogs and live satellite links. Assuming I get that microphone,
Webcam and satellite dish for Christmas that is.</p>

<p>&#8216;Recycle Pool&#8217; will be authored by a succession of guest contributors
including CEO&#8217;s of leading technology companies, penniless Web 2.0
developers, &#8216;B&#8217; listers, long standing subscribers to &#8216;Blog In
Isolation&#8217;, dead pop stars, retired footballers and famous libel
lawyers.</p>

<p>&#8216;Recycle Pool&#8217; will only be available as a beta to a limited number of
subscribers for a small fee of &pound;25 per month. The blog will be
available in all popular RSS formats and an easy to digest email
digest. For a small additional charge, the guest author will come
round to your house and read the content to you. Travel costs and all
expenses are billable.</p>

<p>Top London marketing agency, Scratchy and Scratchy, were paid 3
million pounds to come up with a marketing campaign, corporate
branding, logo and tagline. All their efforts were discarded in favour
of:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;Drudged from the bottom, read into memory, processed and
immediately discarded.&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>Stay tuned for the upcoming first article which will be written by the
most avid reader of &#8216;Blog In Isolation.&#8217; For over a year, this
subscriber has stayed with the blog through thick and thin, for richer
for poorer, in sickness and in health. He has devoured every single
article. He religiously visits the site every single day without fail.
He reads comments, categories, archives, trackbacks.</p>

<p>Sometimes, he obsessively re-reads the same article again and again.
However, this gentleman is a little shy and, to date, has never
summoned up the courage to comment. So, it is with great pleasure
that, after weeks of high powered negotiations in a Travel Lodge Hotel
outside Oxford and a clandestine meeting at a motorway service
station, I am pleased to announce the identity of the first guest: >
Mr. Google Bot</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I made an unexpected debut at my wife&#8217;s book club last night because
because I just happened to have read the book in question and my wife
(still) has a flat tyre.</p>

<p>We all met up at Rosemary Barnstormworth&#8217;s house and she had
thoughtfully laid on prawn volavons, curry flavoured twiglets and
copious amounts of wine.</p>

<p>Obviously, this was my first team debut so I was understandably nervous.
However, I needn&#8217;t have worried as I already knew some of the ladies
present and I was warmly welcomed with a large glass of wine.</p>

<p>After 45 minutes and some pleasantries, I tentatively asked whether we
could actually discuss our thoughts on &#8217;<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Kite-Runner-Khaled-Hosseini/dp/0747566534/sr=1-1/qid=1164747783/ref=sr_1_1/203-2869917-8143900?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books">The Kite
Runner</a>&#8217;.
Hiliary Montague replied &#8216;Oh hang on Norman. There&#8217;s plenty of time for
that. Oh I see you&#8217;re empty. Let me see to that.&#8217; and promptly refilled
my glass.</p>

<p>An hour later, I startled everyone by suddenly interrupting the
conversation with &#8216;Well I thought the book was superbly written,
recounting a story of broken friendship, deeply moving as well as
providing a fascinating insight into life in Afghanistan in the 1970&#8217;s.
Margaret - what did you think ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Well very similar to you really. Very moving. Especially the bit about
the kite.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Zandra - anything to add ?&#8217;</p>

<p>Zandra delved into her handbag for a tissue and pronounced:</p>

<p>&#8216;I found The Kite Runner a deeply moving tale from start to finish
daring to explore the intricacies and prejudices between Sunni and
Shi-ite muslims, the special bond between two friends divided by cast,
wealth, status and ignorance.The book is worth reading to the very last
page if just for the the final scene which tugs at the heart strings
evoking an overwhelming surge of emotion difficult to explain or even
understand yet powerful in it&#8217;s impact.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Thanks Zandra. Are you a reviewer on Amazon ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No. Why ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Well what you just said is identical, word for word, to a review on
Amazon.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Well, err, no. Not exactly.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Listen ladies. I realise it&#8217;s my first time and I don&#8217;t mean to be rude
but not one of you has actually read the book, have you ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Well Norman, no we haven&#8217;t but please have a refill while I explain. We
are all very busy mothers, housewives and wives. Some of us are very
active in the PTA and others work full-time so please forgive us if we
haven&#8217;t always got time to actually read the book. Now maybe we can
charge our glasses and discuss the book for the next meeting. Norman, as
way of apology, what was the last book you read ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh come on. What&#8217;s the point ? You&#8217;re not going to read it anyway.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Now, now Norman. You misunderstand the whole point behind book club.
The most important thing is that we have the name of a book, we are
currently reading, to tell all our friends who are members of rival book
clubs.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Rival book clubs ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh yes, Norman. You wouldn&#8217;t believe the rivalry. I happen to know that
Sheila Henshall has had her eyes on you and your reading list for a
while now. Anyway, after Christmas, we may well have more free time in
January so, come on, what was the last book you read ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Err, well - I can&#8217;t remember.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh come on Norman. Don&#8217;t be so shy now. We are all friends here
tonight&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Well it is called &#8217;<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Cost-Based-Oracle-Fundamentals-v/dp/1590596366/sr=1-1/qid=1164751165/ref=sr_1_1/203-2869917-8143900?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books">Cost Based Oracle:
Fundamentals</a>
(Volume 1)&#8217; by Jonathan Lewis but it is a very technical book about the
Oracle database. To be honest, the book contains lots of mathematics and
statistical theory and it was pretty heavy going even for me and I still
haven&#8217;t actually finished it.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Hmm. Although I bet no-one else will choose it, that doesn&#8217;t sound
entirely suitable. What about the book you are currently reading ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Err, well. I&#8217;m half way through &#8217;<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Heavier-Than-Heaven-Biography-Cobain/dp/0340739398/sr=1-1/qid=1164750166/ref=sr_1_1/203-2869917-8143900?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books">Heavier than
Heaven</a>&#8217;
by Charles Cross.&#8217;</p>

<p>Margaret Smithers-Jones pipes up: &#8216;Oh I think I read about that one in
the Daily Mail. Is it about the life of a man from Orkney who was an
orphan and his constant struggle trying to discover his inner self and
his experiences with various religions before converting to the Church
of Scientology ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Err, no. This book&#8217;s about a grunge rocker from Seattle who rose from
poverty to lead the most influential punk group of the 90&#8217;s to worldwide
acclaim.&#8217;</p>

<p>Linda Postlethwaite replied: &#8216;Err, well it sounds a little far-fetched.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;It&#8217;s a biography and it&#8217;s all true. He later married and had a child
but in 1994, he finally succumbed to his various drug addictions and
depression. He overdosed on heroin and blew his brains out with a
shotgun.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh Norman. I really don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s suitable. Here, for Pete&#8217;s sake,
cheer yourself up with some more wine.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;And some people think his wife was behind his death because he was
about to leave the music business and divorce her.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh Norman - do shut up. Now everyone; what do we all think about Jan
Leeming ?&#8217;</p>
