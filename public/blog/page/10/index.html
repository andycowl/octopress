  <div class="entry-content"><p>Cary Millsap posts a brilliant
<a href="http://carymillsap.blogspot.com/2009/12/my-whole-system-is-slow-now-what.html">article</a>
about his approach to performance troubleshooting that resonated
loudly with me.</p>

<p>When I first started working at Siebel, a standard review was a
production health check that consisted of meetings with key project
staff (Siebel Administrator, DBA, systems and network admins, project
manager, developers) coupled with some standard checks on key Web,
Siebel and Oracle configuration parameters.</p>

<p>At the tail end of one engagement where I had precious little to note
or report on, I asked to meet with an end user for a brief chat. The
response was surprising and not dissimilar to the standard retorts
Cary describes.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>&#8216;Talk to a user ? Why on earth would you want to do
that ?&#8217;  (delivered with suspicious frown)</p></li>
<li><p>&#8216;The user won&#8217;t understand your questions.&#8217; (patronising)</p></li>
<li><p>&#8216;The users don&#8217;t understand the business requirements.&#8217; (surprising
and worrying)</p></li>
<li><p>&#8216;The users are too busy.&#8217;  - &#8216;Can&#8217;t you just talk to a supervisor
instead ?&#8217;</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Of course, most of these responses are instinctive, defensive measures,
immediate responses to what is probably a rather unusual request and, to
be fair and in the interests of balance, I have been introduced to end
users by development staff who do know and obviously have a healthy
relationship with the user community.</p>

<p>If and when I succeeded in getting an audience with an actual user, I
didn&#8217;t actually chat at first.  Instead I introduced myself and simply
asked if I could watch the individual use the system for 10
minutes.</p>

<p>It was often very enlightening just to sit quietly and observe the
business process (typically, handling an inbound call at a call
centre), the subset of available screens accessed by the agent,
typical searches executed to locate data, actions they expected to be
slow, actions they needed to be fast, common tasks they did
frequently, lengthy interactive queries that were truly batch reports
as well as interactions with other applications.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have been
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2009/10/14/how-i-ditched-windows-and-embraced-gloria">running</a>
Linux Mint for 8 weeks now and I&#8217;ve been delighted with it. My desktop
PC is fast and responsive and I am hugely impressed by the sheer
amount and quality of software available for Linux. Printing,
scanning, wireless networking, audio, DVD writing and all my USB
devices just work.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t have a <a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/07/22/so-farewell-then-nis">virus
scanner</a>
consuming memory and chewing clock cycles. I am no longer considering
a memory upgrade as Linux works fine with my paltry 512MB.</p>

<p>I have all my favourite applications available (Picasa, Chrome,
FileZilla, Emacs).  Linux is brilliant as a development platform and
installing software is easy. The Mint desktop looks great and with the
addition of Microsoft TrueType fonts, my display is razor sharp and
crystal clear.</p>

<p>Finally, and perhaps, most importantly, my wife has also embraced the
change. She now uses Thunderbird instead of Outlook Express, Firefox
instead of Internet Explorer, OpenOffice instead of Microsoft Word and
Excel and Nautilus instead of Windows Explorer. All of this was fairly
transparent and painless.</p>

<p>This fulsome praise all sounds like an advert for the wonders of
freedom loving, a precursor for some open source software evangelism
and a concerted attempt to convert the great unwashed to
Linux. However, there is an elephant sitting in the room. Right there
- in the corner.</p>

<p>The Ubuntu and Linux Mint (which is based on Ubuntu) distributions
have a 6 month development cycle. This means that a new release will
appear twice a year which is great because users know when the next
major release is due. In addition, minor fixes, security patches and
improvements are continually being pushed out via automatic
updates. What is not so good is the actual process of upgrading to a
major release which, in my opinion, is relatively complicated and
risky for an inexperienced, new user.</p>

<p>To be fair, Linux Mint are upfront and honest and
<a href="http://www.linuxmint.com/blog/?p=1144">describe</a> the upgrade process
fully, the options available and the pros and cons of each approach.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;There is no guarantee that it will work for you. In fact, this
[dist > upgrade] is quite a risky process. If you&#8217;re experienced and
if you > know how to troubleshoot and solve common Linux problems then
you&#8217;re > probably OK. If you&#8217;re a novice user we recommend you perform
a fresh > installation of Linux Mint 8 instead.&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>David Marsden is an experienced Linux user and
<a href="http://nbrightside.com/blog/2009/12/09/inside-the-open-source-confessional#comment-25305185">comments</a>
that he is comfortable performing Ubuntu upgrades, quickly and reliably
without losing his data. He claims that Ubuntu upgrades are quicker and
easier than applying a Windows Service Pack.</p>

<p>Of course, David&#8217;s absolutely right. Even I managed to upgrade to
Linux Mint 8 at the first attempt without losing any of my user data
and even managed to preserve the configuration settings for all my
favourite applications. In fact, apart from the modified login screen
and wallpaper, the four people who use the Linux computer would have
struggled to notice the change, it was that transparent.</p>

<p>In fact, all I needed to do was:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>When originally installing Linux,
create dedicated, separate partitions for user home directories and
data. I use &#8216;/home&#8217; (user directories) and &#8216;/data&#8217; (music, photos,
documents).</p></li>
<li><p>Try to stick to the default Mint (and Ubuntu) software
repositories.</p></li>
<li><p>Note down the additional applications and software
packages you have installed.</p></li>
<li><p>Jot down user and group id&#8217;s (copy
&#8216;/etc/passwd&#8217; and &#8216;/etc/group&#8217;).</p></li>
<li><p>Backup the home and data file
systems (twice). Check the numbers of files. Check the size of the
directories. Check the checksums. Check the backups are
readable. Check the hidden directories. Check the backup disk isn&#8217;t
full. Check everything.</p></li>
<li><p>Burn the Install CD and install the
&#8216;upgrade&#8217;.</p></li>
<li><p>Preserve the &#8216;/home&#8217; and &#8216;/data&#8217; file systems, leaving
all existing data intact. You did remember to jot down that &#8216;/home&#8217; is
&#8216;/dev/sda6&#8217; and &#8216;/data&#8217; is &#8216;/dev/sda8&#8217;, didn&#8217;t you ?</p></li>
<li><p>Move &#8216;/home/user&#8217; to &#8216;/home/user.backup&#8217;. Repeat for each user
account. This ensures that Gnome and desktop related settings are
re-created.</p></li>
<li><p>Re-create the necessary user accounts and ensure the
user and group identifiers are the same as before.</p></li>
<li><p>Selectively, copy the various, &#8216;hidden&#8217; dot directories for
applications (Rythmbox, Picasa, Pidgin) back into the user directory
to preserve the application settings.</p></li>
<li><p>Reconfigure wireless networking.</p></li>
<li><p>Reconfigure the printer.</p></li>
<li><p>Remove the irritating fortune cookie from &#8216;Terminal&#8217; (Mint only).</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Now I am fairly technical and understand most of this. I have no problem
whatsoever doing all of this. David is correct - all of this is common
sense, quick to do and the whole process takes less than 2 hours. I
don&#8217;t even mind repeating this process every six months because, as
David points out, I have a new, shiny operating system with new
features, additional applications, bug fixes and improvements.</p>

<p>What I have a problem with is trying to explain this whole, convoluted
process to my father. Or rather, rescuing his system after he has
failed to follow this process. Remotely.</p>

<p>Of course, my father has a few options available. If it ain&#8217;t broke,
don&#8217;t fix it - if Mint Gloria works fine than stick rather than
twist. Alternatively, he could use a distribution that automatically
performs rolling upgrades so his software is always the latest and
greatest.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After buying most of my Christmas presents from them, Amazon kindly gave
me a &pound;2 voucher to spend in the MP3 download store.</p>

<p>As the festive season of hosting friends and family approaches, I
decided on a &#8216;easy listening&#8217;, &#8216;middle of the road&#8217; purchase suitable
for all the family to act as a quiet backdrop while we gather to play
charades around the fire.</p>

<p>&#8216;<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Killing-Joke/dp/B0009RRRC8/ref=ntt_mus_ep_dpp_2">Killing
Joke</a>&#8217;
by &#8217;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_Joke">Killing Joke</a>&#8217; was one
of the first vinyl records I ever bought and, as always, I was
introduced to the band by the wonderful <a href="http://nbrightside.com/blog/2006/09/08/margrave-of-the-marshes">John
Peel</a>. I
was intrigued by the cover art which I still think is brilliant.</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.co.uk/lh/photo/mhfXJaHAc9B7sD8RHEG9Rw?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_l2uGy1RGCiE/Syd-Mc4zSiI/AAAAAAAABes/MOwR8IEOvbE/s800/Killing-Joke.jpg" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p>Killing Joke also used another very striking and evocative image. When
I visited a mate in London, I was surprised to see he had a massive
Killing Joke poster adorning his lounge of Nazis saluting the Pope.
Initially, I thought it was a mock-up but he told me it was a genuine
photograph from the 1930&#8217;s and while he wasn&#8217;t a right-wing fascist
(quite the contrary in fact), he also thought it was a very striking
and thought provoking image.</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.co.uk/lh/photo/uKSRj0kFXVAlDP-yC_b_kw?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_l2uGy1RGCiE/Syd-MrXOpPI/AAAAAAAABew/U7Nc1_bAShg/s800/Nazis-Pope.jpg" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p>I&#8217;m pleased to report the LP sounds as fresh as it did 30 years ago.
Deserves to be played loud.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&#8216;Dear Father - It is 6 weeks since my last confession. Since then I
have&#8230;&#8217;</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Installed <a href="http://www.mozillamessaging.com/en-US/thunderbird/3.0/releasenotes/">Thunderbird
3</a>
which handles all my work email. This upgrade went smoothly enough
although there were some minor glitches with server authentication
and message filters. Thunderbird 3 adds tabs, UI enhancements, IMAP
synchronisation, much needed improvements to the address book in
addition to faster searching.</p></li>
<li><p>Upgraded my desktop PC to Linux <a href="http://www.linuxmint.com/blog/?p=1155">Mint
8</a>. Again, this went smoothly
enough, mainly because I did a full blown install while carefully
preserving my user data. Until Linux upgrades are &#8216;rolling&#8217; and as
easy as applying a Windows Service Pack, Linux will never succeed in
the mainstream.</p></li>
<li><p>Installed <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome?platform=linux&amp;hl=en">Google
Chrome</a> on Mint</p>

<ol>
<li>This was probably the only software I missed from Windows and
God, I had forgotten how much faster Chrome is than Firefox. Chrome
is blindingly fast on Linux, staggeringly fast, unbelievably fast.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Playing around with <a href="http://www.dokuwiki.org/dokuwiki">DokuWiki</a> to
replace Diigo and Google Notebook in an effort to use more open
source software and get more of my data under my control.</p></li>
<li><p>Installed Laconica 0.8.2 so
<a href="http://nbrightside.com/laconica/index.php/billy">Billy</a> has his
very own sandpit to play with spammers in.</p></li>
<li><p>Upgraded this blog to the latest bleeding edge of Habari (0.7 alpha)
and was relieved to see it still worked.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>&#8216;Go in peace, my son. Admirable efforts but my sources tell me you are
flagrantly continuing to use freedom hating, Microsoft TrueType Fonts to
enhance your browsing experience on Linux, so please say three Hail
Mary&#8217;s and an Our Father as penance. Go in peace to love and serve RMS.&#8217;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This conversation didn&#8217;t actually take place but it could have.</p>

<p>Last week, friends and I were discussing µblogging in the pub. Well not
µblogging exactly but two ladies had recently discovered Facebook and
were talking about the pros and cons of this wonderful social network.</p>

<p>One lady said: ‘Oh and another thing - I really don&#8217;t like the ‘Jenny
is…&#8217; status update. I just don&#8217;t get it.&#8217;</p>

<p>The other lady replied ‘Yeah - that bit is stupid. I am hardly going to
write down ‘Marilyn is…just off to Asda for the weekend shop&#8217;.</p>

<p>I then interjected: ‘But you don&#8217;t have to put down minutiae after the
‘is…&#8217; part&#8217;. You can put anything. For example, I might choose to write</p>

<p>‘Norman is….seriously considering jacking his job in, pursuing his dream
and opening a record shop&#8217;.</p>

<p>They looked at me as though as I was mad. My mate sighed and said ‘Right
- who&#8217;s up for another ?&#8217;</p>

<p>Jenny stared at me as though I had two heads and said ‘What ? You&#8217;re
going to open a record shop ? In these tense and difficult times. Are
you serious ?&#8217;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A few years ago, on a Wednesday night, I returned from work and Norma
told me in passing that she had got a man coming to clean our carpets
for free.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later, I found myself welcoming not one but two Kirby
salesmen into my house. What followed was possibly the worst 96 minutes
of my life (with the possible exception of yesterday&#8217;s fixture at
Anfield).</p>

<p>I am normally polite and well mannered so I dutifully sat with my cup of
tea and listened to the sales guy&#8217;s pitch about the miscellaneous
wonders of the Kirby vacuum cleaner.</p>

<p>After a while of professional, polished and non-stop patter, I
interjected and tried to ask &#8216;OK - this sounds great but how much is it
?&#8217; in an effort to curtail proceedings but was ignored.</p>

<p>I waited patiently as he assembled various attachments for dog hair,
vacuuming the inside of the car and accessing the hard to reach areas
behind radiators.</p>

<p>I got slightly more irritated as Norma excused herself to make tea for
the kids and the senior salesman passed over to the junior apprentice
for phase 2.</p>

<p>I cursed silently as Norma returned and asked &#8216;Listen - you&#8217;ve been here
25 minutes now. When are you going to hoover my carpets for me ?&#8217;.
Without pausing for breath, senior sales guy triumphantly plugged in the
vacuum cleaner, and proceeded to clean and re-clean a 4 inch square of
my lounge carpet. He then instructed his stooge to dump the contents
onto a white cloth and invited us both to examine the contents in minute
detail.</p>

<p>It was dust. Not that fascinating.</p>

<p>Again, I interjected with &#8216;Listen - I&#8217;m really not interest-&#8217; but was
interrupted with &#8216;OK - now we will hoover your bed for you. Please bring
your current hoover upstairs&#8217;. To my horror, Norma led them upstairs
where they apparently lifted up a duvet and vacuumed the mattress of my
6 year old daughter. Twice.</p>

<p>Two more pristine white cloths was brought out and we poured over the
skin debris that a human leaves behind on the sheets when asleep. We
compared and contrasted the superlative results of the Kirby which has
lifted much more dirt than our Panasonic hoover.</p>

<p>Norma, feeling incredibly guilty and no doubt a little embarrassed, now
started to assert herself and politely asked the salesmen to leave as it
was now the kids&#8217; bedtime.</p>

<p>Still, the two sales guys persisted as, after what seemed like hours, we
entered the home straight and the the closing of the deal. Finally, we
got to a price. It was a lot - I think it was over &pound;2,000 which almost
made me spill my now cold cup of tea. I countered with &#8216;Come on, I can
get a Panasonic for &pound;200 from Comet&#8217; and the sales guy immediately
replied with his &#8216;Objection-Retort&#8217; from the school of pressure selling
about the benefits of the Kirby and its lifetime guarantee.</p>

<p>My wife left the room. I could tell she was now quite upset at the
imposition of having these chaps in our house, interrupting our routine.
People who upset my wife (with one honourable exception - me) tend to
upset me so I now got slightly more forceful.</p>

<p>&#8216;Listen, chaps. I realise my wife invited you here this evening but she
thought she was getting her carpets cleaned for free not a gentle,
prolonged, high pressure sales pitch. We&#8217;ve got a hoover. We&#8217;re not
looking to buy a hoover and we certainly would never contemplate a Kirby
hoover that cost over &pound;2,000.&#8217;</p>

<p>Senior salesman piped up with &#8216;Ah but that&#8217;s the good news Mr.
Brightside - if you commit tonight, I can offer you a 40% discount.&#8217;</p>

<p>I sighed inwardly and stared at the mantelpiece. I was transfixed. I
stared again at the clock on the mantelpiece. The time was 7:41pm on a
Wednesday night.</p>

<p>I stood up, folded up the white cloth, put the assorted attachments back
into the box and handed it to the junior apprentice.</p>

<p>&#8216;Listen lads. I realise you&#8217;re only doing your job but my wife has
politely asked you to leave. I have also politely asked you to get out
of my house but United are playing in Lyon and the game kicks off in 4
minutes so now I telling you to get your fucking stuff together and
leave. Now.&#8217;</p>

<p>Senior sales guy could now (finally) see the writing on the wall and
started moaning about how we&#8217;d wasted their time - a little ironic as I
viewed it as them wasting our time - and started to protest and call me
rude names.</p>

<p>I ignored him, turned the TV on, picked up his box of tricks and his
catalogues and ushered them both to the door.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Driving along the M25, my son noticed some large graffiti on a bridge</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;Give peas a chance&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>Norman Junior III: &#8216;Hmm - that&#8217;s interesting &#8216;Give peas a chance&#8217; - what
does that mean ?&#8217;</p>

<p>Me: &#8216;Well these days broccoli and green beans are getting really popular
so these people just want us all to give peas a chance.&#8217;</p>

<p>17 seconds silence then both of us burst out in uncontrollable laughter.</p>

<p>Update: A
<a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_8oN8rk_3ftU/Sgnx7cZv5_I/AAAAAAAAAMc/ZLqrfcN1uHw/s1600-h/Give+Peas+a+Chance.jpg">picture</a>
is worth a thousand words (or peas).</p>
