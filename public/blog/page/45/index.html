  <div class="entry-content"><p>Dear Reader</p>

<p>My cruel owner got very excited last night when he went to play with his
rotating tagline. Instead of his precious blog, much to his surprise, he
was presented with
<a href="http://flickr.com/photos/70276096@N00/376841735/">this</a>. His reaction
to this mundane error was startling.</p>

<blockquote><p>At last ! Look, blog, look at this. 18 months and I&#8217;ve finally done
it. At last ! We&#8217;ve been dugg ! Why did it take them so long to catch
on ? Look blog, look. Finally, we&#8217;ve been Slashdotted !
The poor old servers at Bluehost don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s hit them. Thousands
of hits per second. Apache is on its knees begging for mercy and more
swap space. Why, I bet <a href="http://mattheaton.com">Matt Eaton</a> will be on
the phone any second now. We&#8217;ve done it. Technorati <a href="http://technorati.com/pop/blogs/">Top
100</a>. Blog, look, just look at that
<a href="http://flickr.com/photos/70276096@N00/376841735/">screen</a> !</p>

<p>18 months, 3 different hosting providers, 500 articles, 4 readers, 6
comments and 2 self-inflicted disasters. And now, finally, it is all
worthwhile. My life is complete. And you know what - I think it is
very interesting how all this happened shortly after my brilliant idea
to introduce the rotating
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/01/29/how-to-rotate-taglines-on-your-wordpress-blog/">tagline</a>.</p>

<p>Of course, you know what this means, blog. We&#8217;re going to have to move
house (again). Prestigious, high traffic sites on the
<a href="http://tailrank.com/">TailRank</a> front page can&#8217;t live on cheap, 5
dollar a month hosting.</p>

<p>We are going to have to move to
<a href="http://www.mediatemple.net/">MediaTemple</a> with a powerful grid
infrastructure. Of course, the hosting will be absolutely free because
MediaTemple will be fighting off Google and Microsoft for the
privilege of hosting us !</p>

<p>Now I need to go and powder my nose. I&#8217;m doing a podcast on the
<a href="http://www.podtech.net/scobleshow/">Scoble Show</a> in 10 minutes.</p></blockquote>

<p>My cruel owner was so excited and happy, I couldn&#8217;t bear to tell him
this was just a temporary glitch on the Bluehost monitoring agent and
everything was back to nomal now.
Yours</p>

<p>The interminable bytestream that is &#8216;Blog in isolation&#8217;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last night, I happened to catch my wife composing an email. I noticed
that when she sent a personal email to her friends, she invariably typed
&#8216;From Norma&#8217; as the subject line. This just seemed really weird to me.</p>

<p>I asked her what she thought of the &#8217;<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/6318531.stm">semantic
web</a>&#8217; and whether she
had given any thought to adding
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/03/02/tags-categories-and-labels/">tags</a>
to her personal emails such as &#8216;Norma&#8217; and &#8216;From&#8217; to help build a
valuable <a href="http://drupal.org/handbook/modules/taxonomy">taxonomy</a> for her
friends.</p>

<p>She looked at me blankly and said &#8216;Just because you work with computers,
you think you&#8217;re so clever, don&#8217;t you ?&#8217;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I always smile whenever I receive an email that opens &#8216;I heard that
Stephen Hawksworth Smithers-Jones in ABC division gets&#8230;&#8217;</p>

<p>Over the years I have heard the following myths about the delights of
working in the completely fictional division ABC.</p>

<ul>
<li>Unlimited broadband paid for by the company.</li>
<li>Mandatory business class flights on short-haul.</li>
<li>Complimentary chauffeur service from your house to LHR/LGW.</li>
<li>Expenses automatically paid via psychic medium with no need for
receipts.</li>
<li>No need for approvals for anything from anyone.</li>
<li>Prawn volavons with a garlic and tomato sauce brought to their desks
at 12 noon precisely (even when onsite).</li>
<li>First shout on the airplane toilet when the seat-belts sign is
extinguished.</li>
<li>Free laundry and ironing service when onsite for more than one night</li>
<li>New laptops every quarter (subject to stringent personal, divisional
and corporate performance goals). Every month otherwise.</li>
<li>Complimentary invites to the client&#8217;s Christmas bash and summer BBQ
(free bar and partners included).</li>
<li>Secret inclusion in the company car (&#8216;Gold - Level 3&#8217;) scheme with
access to a brand new model every 3 months.</li>
<li>A massive incentive payment to not to desert to main rival during
any (rumoured) takeover.</li>
<li>2.6 million shares, 1.2 million stock options and 876,542
FlexPoints. Index linked.</li>
<li>Contributory pension scheme; Company contributes 24 times salary.
Employee contributes nothing.</li>
</ul>


<p>It always reminds me of the advert: &#8216;Carlsberg don&#8217;t run an IT
consultancy, but if they did, it would be like this&#8230;&#8217;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Thankfully, Scoble has finally found the &#8217;<a href="http://scobleizer.com/2007/01/30/i-removed-snaps-previews-from-here/">Disable
Snap</a>&#8217;
button on his WP
<a href="http://flickr.com/photos/70276096@N00/375498720/">dashboard</a>. Only
another 641,000 WordPress blogs to go.</p>

<p>If you don&#8217;t know what I am talking about, just explore Jonathan Lewis&#8217;
excellent Wordpress <a href="http://jonathanlewis.wordpress.com/">blog</a> and see
how long you last before exploding. [Hint: hover over a hyperlink]</p>

<p>If you can&#8217;t be bothered, look
<a href="http://flickr.com/photos/70276096@N00/375494574/">here</a> although a
screenshot can&#8217;t do justice to the mind numbing effect and irritation
factor.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.tomrafteryit.net/">Tom Raftery</a> also notes the presence of
the dreaded <a href="http://www.tomrafteryit.net/annoying-snaps/">Snap</a> preview
and asks for opinions. In fact, this post started out as a comment on
Tom&#8217;s blog but I think this now merits a full-blown rant.</p>

<blockquote><p>Hi Tom
I dislike those Snap previews immensely.</p>

<p>In fact, I absolutely hate, despise and loathe them with a vengeance.</p>

<p>WordPress.com added
<a href="http://wordpress.com/blog/2007/01/13/snap-live/">Snap</a> functionality
for all users (default=TRUE). To be fair, following lots of user
<a href="http://wank.wordpress.com/2007/01/14/snappish/">feedback</a>
(surprisingly not all of it positive), WordPress made Snap a
configurable option so users could disable the damned distracting
Adware popups.</p>

<p>Judging by the number of WP blogs still displaying them, it appears
the default is still enabled.</p>

<p>I think WordPress and Snap are great friends in the Web 2.0 sense but
no disclosure about money changing hands was ever made.</p>

<p>I would pay WordPress good money to disable Snap. Permanently. Maybe a
new business model presents itself.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Next week, I am bound for the wonderful city of
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/04/25/wonderful-wonderful-copenhagen/">Copenhagen</a>,
near Denmark. I normally aim to stay in a hotel close to the client
offices. If my commute can be done on foot, I am absolutely delighted.</p>

<p>However, on this one occasion, I have elected to stay on the other side
of town which, unfortunately, will mean a very long <a href="http://ocaoimh.ie/2007/01/31/topless-speed-bandits-cause-traffic-pile-up/">taxi
ride</a>
over a congested bridge, to cross the city in rush-hour. Once in the
morning and again in the afternoon.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Despite occasionally enjoying this <a href="http://thedailywtf.com/">site</a> and
subscribing to this Oracle focussed
<a href="http://oracle-wtf.blogspot.com/">offshoot</a>, I always laid awake at

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was vaguely aware that NTL merged with Telewest last year but a glossy
black/red envelope, announcing the brave new world of &#8216;Virgin Media&#8217;,
took me a little off guard this morning.</p>

<p>I sincerely hope that my existing Telewest service is not affected by
NTL&#8217;s recent acquisition of Virgin Mobile.</p>

<p>My Telewest broadband service works fine (apart from the occasional
self-inflicted glitch with my
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/04/17/more-wireless-fun/">wireless</a>
router).</p>

<p>My Telewest email works fine (apart from a recent problem where the POP3
server times out on the first connection and works perfectly
thereafter).</p>

<p>My Telewest Digital TV service works fine (apart from that outage on
Millennium Eve that my mother-in-law keeps reminding me about).</p>

<p>And now, thousands of pounds will be spent on an expensive rebranding
exercise, a public launch party, personal communications from Richard
Branson to all customers and a spiffy new Web <del>site</del> media
<a href="http://knowfirst.co.uk/">portal</a> with quotes like</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;Watch it, surf it, talk it, walk it. We&#8217;re there with you every step
of the way. Love The Virgin Media Team x&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>Worse, they are are promising me a brand new email address. Please
prepare to update your address books to &#8216;norman@virginmedia.net&#8217;.
Another example is the jokey, friendly marketing flyer I am now reading
&#8216;Small print that you can actually see&#8217; with a pledge for plain English
speaking.</p>

<p>The T&amp;C&#8217;s is titled &#8216;Boring (but important) stuff for you to read&#8217; and
contains 10, yes 10, pages of very small print that I can&#8217;t be bothered
to read.</p>

<p>Another source of unease is that, many years ago in the days of 28.8
dial-up modems, bulletin boards and extension cables trailing across the
bedroom, I was a customer of Virgin.net where I received some appalling
service and was eventually forced to go elsewhere.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After my recent brush with
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/01/24/fun-with-disaster-recovery/">disaster</a>,
I realised that my, err, backup strategy relied on me remembering to
perform a manual, occasional Wordpress export or a database backup.</p>

<p>This was acceptable while I was messing around with this blogging lark
but now I realise that it would be a little disappointing to lose the
entire contents of my blog.</p>

<p>While Bluehost run backups (which have saved my skin once), it would be
foolish to completely
<a href="http://www.tomrafteryit.net/blacknight-customer-service-gets-worse/">rely</a>
on my hosting provider and the height of stupidity to rely on me !</p>

<p>As I said to a lovely hotel receptionist in Brussels recently,
struggling to find the reservation made on my behalf for Monday night,
&#8216;We have a saying in England - if you want something doing, then do it
yourself.&#8217; She nodded sagely as she eventually unearthed my booking for
Tuesday night by which time I would have left the country.</p>

<p>Unlike <a href="http://www.rittman.net/2006/11/15/wheres-everything-gone/">Mark
Rittman</a>, I
can&#8217;t really count on the goodwill of both my readers to manually type
in more than 500 articles, so I looked around for a fully automated
backup that would backup all of my MySQL databases (not just WordPress)
using cron.</p>

<p><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/automysqlbackup/">AutoMySQLBackup</a> does
exactly what it says on the tin and works like a dream.</p>

<p>I even tested it on a local installation because we all know backups are
worthless unless you prove that you can actually restore them.</p>
