  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was investigating the bewildering world of trackbacks, pingbacks and
blog comments and found that my existing provider, blogger.com,
supports backlinks (inbound links to a specific article from a Google
search) but not trackbacks.</p>

<p>Then I discovered <a href="http://wordpress.org/">Wordpress.org</a> which is a
blogging tool that supports proper trackbacks, pingbacks (and a whole
lot more besides). Although Wordpress is a freely available OpenSource
PHP based application, I would need to upgrade my current web hosting
to include PHP (for the massive sum of an additional 4GBP per month).</p>

<p>Then I discovered the hosted service
<a href="http://wordpress.com/">Wordpress.com</a> which offers the same
functionality so I registered for an invitation email. A little more
research unearthed the useful fact that the recently released Flock
browser also includes a free Wordpress.com account. I immediately
downloaded Flock and got myself this new, shiny Wordpress blog.</p>

<p>I like the blog editing facilities (you can tag each post in multiple
categories) which may render that tedious task of manually adding
Technorati tags obsolete.</p>

<p>Pros: trackbacks, pingbacks, categories, builtin referrer tracking,
immediate WSIWYG preview, automatic Technorati pings</p>

<p>Cons: no direct access to Web server logs and statistics, need to
manually import existing blog from blogger, centred formatting, need
to burn new feed, lose thousands of readers</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I used to work for Ingres (in London) who were a fantastic company to
work for. Amazingly, they are the only company I have ever worked for
to use newsgroups for internal technical discussions and knowledge
sharing instead of email aliases. I once read that processing an
individual email costs a company 10 cents.</p>

<p>In the early 90&#8217;s, Ingres was under commercial pressue from another
large relational database vendor, Oracle. Instead of responding to
this challenge, Ingres tended to &#8216;fiddle while Rome burned&#8217;, discuss
the API naming convention by committee and stoutly defend the
technical purity of page level locking (Oracle supported row level
locking and capitalised heavily) from a lofty ivory tower.</p>

<p>Eventually, Computer Associates took over Ingres which most staff
viewed as the end of the world. The truth was that CA saved Ingres
from Chapter 11 (bankruptcy).</p>

<p>Although I had never visited Alameda and Islandia (Ingres&#8217; and CA&#8217;s
respective corporate headquarters), I still have this vision of hard
nosed businessmen in sharp suits invading the Alameda campus to
interview all these bearded techies in sandals.</p>

<p>On the day of the takeover, Oracle parked a truck outside Ingres&#8217; UK
offices with a billboard &#8216;Oracle are hiring now&#8217;. The story got a lot
of coverage in the UK computer press. Once again, superb marketing
from Oracle.</p>

<p>The Ingres engineers left the company in droves, formed self-help
groups and arranged annual wakes to commemorate the anniversary of the
black day.</p>

<p>CA subsequently rebranded the product OpenIngres but it largely
disappeared from view into CA&#8217;s vast portfolio of thousands of
different software products.</p>

<p>So, it was nice to see <a href="http://www.ingres.com/">Ingres</a> back in the
news this week as CA announced that Ingres Corporation will be once
again be a separate company and the product will be available as an
Open Source database.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Dear Cathy &amp; Claire</p>

<p>&#8216;I have just started going out with a boy much older than me&#8230;&#8217;</p>

<p>No - sorry. I have just started blogging and find myself increasingly
worrying about blogging etiquette. For example, I just read an
interesting article about Oracle by Jeff Moss and wrote a followup on
my blog. I felt my article was too long to be posted as a comment on
Jeff&#8217;s blog.</p>

<p>So what do I do ? I want to acknowledge Jeff&#8217;s original article. Do I
post a comment on Jeff&#8217;s blog saying &#8216;Nice article Jeff. This inspired
me to write my own followup here&#8217; (with a link to my blog).</p>

<p>Or would that be considered rude and close to spam or trawling for
traffic by the blogging community ?</p>

<p>Should my thoughts truly been a lengthy comment on Jeff&#8217;s blog ?</p>

<p>Also, people occasionally comment on my blog but don&#8217;t leave an email
address so I am unable to followup directly with the
individual. Again, I don&#8217;t think it merits a comment from me on my own
blog to say &#8216;Thanks for popping by. I found your blog on the Palm PDA
very useful&#8217;.</p>

<p>Alternatively, if I visit their blog and add a comment, it would be
totally out of context.</p>

<p>Thanks for any advice</p>

<p>Norman</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Jeff Moss&#8217;
<a href="http://oramossoracle.blogspot.com/2005/11/free-toad-at-least-until-raptor-comes.html">article</a>
about the commercial and free versions of Toad and the incredibly
tenacious, persistent breed of salesperson bred by Quest Software got
me thinking about the Oracle DBA tools I use.</p>

<ul>
<li>People</li>
<li>SQL*Plus</li>
<li>Statspack</li>
<li>putty</li>
</ul>


<p>People are important because people have developed the application,
people are using the application, people are managing the servers,
people are managing the database and intelligent people have
configured that very expensive storage array.</p>

<p>These people know a lot about the application, the history of the
project, the successes and failures, the lessons learned, the
architecture, the infrastructure whereas I may know, quite literally,
nothing about the same subjects.</p>

<p>I have seen people using Toad (and similar GUI based Oracle
development tools) very effectively, multi-tasking, flipping between
windows at breakneck speed. Sometimes it makes me quite tired just
watching them.</p>

<p>However, I prefer SQL*Plus to do most of the work because :-</p>

<ul>
<li>SQL*Plus provides a complete report of my session, with timings,
query plans, statistics. No need to frantically try to write it all
down.</li>
<li>The SQL script can be incrementally developed and is repeatable. It
is quite easy in Toad to execute an arbitrary set of mouse-clicks so
it is not clear which of the six &#8216;alter session&#8217; statements were
actually in effect when you finally got the optimal results.</li>
<li>SQL*Plus is the &#8216;vi&#8217; of the Oracle world. It is the one Oracle tool
you are guaranteed to have access to, everywhere. The sys admin may
not allow you to install commerial software without a valid license
or may use another tool you have never seen before.</li>
<li>SQL*Plus can use bind variables, provide the query plan (with or
without retrieving the 6 million records) and provide the vital
statistics (consistent gets) just the same as the GUI tools. Almost
everything you need in fact.</li>
</ul>


<p>Statspack is important because it is an Oracle package. Oracle will
maintain and develop statspack for the latest features available in
10g.  Statspack produces reports in a standard format which can easily
be analysed by others (colleagues, DBA&#8217;s, even Oracle). Statspack can
also be configured to run automatically at regular intervals. If there
is always a problem with the overnight ETL at 03.30, I would rather
statspack gets the overtime and gathers the performance metrics rather
than me sitting there in the middle of the night.</p>

<p>Statspack tells the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the
truth. It is incredibly tempting to use an Oracle monitoring tool like
OEM or Spotlight, obsessively watching the screen, drilling in on what
appears to be an expensive query and your salvation. The problem is
that you don&#8217;t know the query in question is only spawned once a
quarter for the accountant&#8217;s financial report and runs in batch. The
query could take 37 minutes and no-one would care. It is simply not
important. It is not what the users are complaining about.</p>

<p>Worse, because your refresh interval is 5 seconds, you are blissfully
unaware that you have missed the crucial SQL query with literal SQL
that takes 1.7 seconds but is executed hundreds of times per second.
Statspack does.</p>

<p>Setting the default statspack level to level 7 means that statspack
can (retrospectively) produce the query plan for any problematic SQL
statement identified in the summary report. This is handy where you
may have long winded SQL statements where the summary report has
tantalisingly truncated the SQL text just as the WHERE clause starts.</p>

<p>Putty is important so you can run O/S utilities (prstat, glance,
topas, top, iostat, vmstat) to monitor the actual database server
during the investigations. If the server is a development server
hosting multiple Oracle instances with 2 CPU&#8217;s running at 100% and
saturated disks, then the performance of the application will be
impacted, no matter what wizardry you weave.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Dear Bill</p>

<p>I live in London (near England) and would like to buy Microsoft Money
and Microsoft Office. My preferred method of obtaining the goods would
be to download these programs from your Web site and pay using a
credit card.</p>

<p>A small discount to reflect the reduced administration costs,
packaging and margin taken by the retailer would be nice but not
essential.</p>

<p>However, when I attempt to buy these Microsoft products in the UK, I
am redirected to third party Web sites (Amazon, Dabs, PC World etc) or
I can delay the purchasing decision by downloading a 60 day trial
version.</p>

<p>Buying the products from another outlet means that I have to do extra
work just to make the order. This delay will be irritating and I might
even consider using OpenOffice which I can download for free and start
using now.</p>

<p>In fact, the only disadvantage of OpenOffice is that I anticipate my
children handing in a piece of homework that Microsoft
Word/PowerPoint/Excel is unable to convert correctly. Consequently
their fantastic effort will receive a mark of zero and a detention as
the teacher will not accept &#8216;But, Sir, my Dad is an OpenSource
evangelist&#8217; as a valid excuse.</p>

<p>Once I have ordered from Amazon, I then have to wait for the goods to
be shipped, pray that Royal Mail doesn&#8217;t mislay them and the postman
doesn&#8217;t leave the package unattended on my doorstep in the pouring
rain (just because I didn&#8217;t tip him last Xmas).</p>

<p>When I finally receive the goods, I then have to unwrap a large box
containing fresh air to finally get my hands on the CD-ROM. There is
no hardcopy user guide included as all the product documentation is
now available online.</p>

<p>Note that Microsoft Money only costs 20GBP so comes supplied in a
smaller box with less fresh air than Microsoft Office which costs
90GBP and, obviously, comes in a larger box with more fresh air.</p>

<p>I would prefer any response from Microsoft to be in the form of a old
fashioned handwritten letter instead of this new fangled email
technology.</p>

<p>Kind regards</p>

<p>Norman Brightside (Mr.)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My post about Patrick Gibson reminded me of another Irish genius who,
sadly, is currently critcially ill in a London hospital.</p>

<p>A bell-boy was summoned to George Best&#8217;s luxurious hotel room. He
stared in amazement at the scene that greeted him. Empty, discarded
bottles of champagne everywhere, a scantily clad Mary Stavin (Miss
World) lying on the bed surrounded by ten pound notes.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A kind lady called Sarah encountered my blog, was horrified by what
she saw, and and proffered this
<a href="http://sarahk.pcpropertymanager.com/blog/essential-change-to-blogger-templates/163">suggestion</a>for
tweaking the standard blogger template to add the readability of long
articles by adding the heading to the footer section.</p>

<p>Eventually, I managed to successfully apply the changes (she left a
spurious space character to ensure you have a little work to do) so I
hope you enjoy the changes as much as I do.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>What would you do with 1 million GBP ?</p>

<p>Would you buy a mansion, a yacht and a Ferrari, give up your job, go
on holiday, donate it all to charity, buy your parents a new house,
take over your local football club or get U2 to play at your son&#8217;s
birthday party ?</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t worry - I haven&#8217;t succumbed to the lure of &#8216;1001 subjects to
blog about&#8217; for people with vacuous brains.</p>

<p>This was precisely the quandry facing Patrick Gibson in 2004 when he
scooped the top prize of 1 million pounds on the ITV show &#8216;Who wants
to be a Millionaire&#8217;.</p>

<p>Anyway, Patrick chose to buy the complete Iain Banks&#8217; books catalogue
together with DVD&#8217;s of Quentin Tarantino&#8217;s films and every single
episode of Channel 4&#8217;s hilarious TV comedy &#8216;Father Ted&#8217;. The reason
was that these were to be Patrick&#8217;s specialist subjects for BBC&#8217;s
Mastermind quiz.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t laugh - Patrick was crowned Mastermind of Great Brtain on last
night&#8217;s enthralling show ! Even better, the narrow victory for the
Irish software developer prevented an Australian gentleman hoisting
the impressive, crystal glass fruit bowl aloft.</p>

<p>Another crushing defeat for the Aussies - oh dear.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So, you have set up the blog, got loads of interesting ideas for
articles, robots and spiders are crawling everywhere, Adsense is
configured and has already produced a massive return of 0.27USD and
you are all set to go. One last problem, what are you actually going
to call this blog ?</p>

<p>What&#8217;s in a name ? Well quite a lot actually. I usually like to read
the title and extended description of any blogs I encounter. I think
the title alone can tell you quite a lot about the author and the
content.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I am totally devoid of imagination. That&#8217;s one of the
reasons I was never in a band. I simply would never be able to think
up song and album titles let alone lyrics. The other reasons are that
I can not play any musical instruments, sing or dance.</p>

<p>My imaginative offering for the name of my blog is currently &#8216;Andy C&#8217;
for the title and &#8216;Blog in Isolation&#8217; for the description as it seems
quite apt. Originally, this blog started out in life hosted at
blogger, under a large black cape of anonymity and was called
&#8216;RomanTotaleXVII&#8217; because no-one in the world knows what it means (the
name is a character from a Fall song).</p>

<p>&#8216;Blog in Isolation&#8217; is a reference to a wonderful song &#8216;Soul in
Isolation&#8217; by the most underrated band in Manchester - The Chameleons.</p>

<p>Other candidate titles considered were:</p>

<ul>
<li>Andy C&#8217;s blog (boring but plenty of people use it!)</li>
<li>The Wonderful And Frightening World&#8230; (The Fall)</li>
<li>Open Up Your Eager Eyes (The Killers)</li>
<li>Oracle Performance Tuning with Hit Ratio Harry (may yet appear as an
article)</li>
<li>View From A Hill (The Chameleons)</li>
<li>Pedantry Begins At Home (oblique reference to The Smiths)</li>
<li>In My Area (The Fall)</li>
<li>Under The Covers with Norman Brightside (useful opening slide for
technical presentations)</li>
<li>Oracle Oldies Blog (featuring dictionary managed tablespaces,
constant reorganisations, manual rollback segments and configuration
of sort_area_[retained]_size)</li>
<li>This is the way, step inside (Joy Division)</li>
<li>The life and times of a (failed) dot com millionaire</li>
<li>77 Barton Road (where Ian Curtis took his life - too morbid)</li>
<li>The NWRA (The North Will Rise Again - The Fall)</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Absolutely anything can be a suitable subject for a blog entry; a
Website of interest, OpenSource software, breaking news, a personal
anecdote, a witty comment from a colleague, politics, a joke, a
holiday, Microsoft, music, gadgets, your teams latest victory,
anything.</p>

<p>Just because someone else (an esteeemed blogger or maybe even a
professional journalist) has written an article on the same subject,
don&#8217;t necessarily let that put you off. Lots of people are searching
blogs for a personal view and not that of a journalist. For example,
if I am considering the purchase of a digital radio for my car, I
would rather hear your views on the same make and model rather than
read a two year old review in AutoExpress.</p>

<p>As for technical content, while there might be reams of manuals, a
wealth of text books and assorted wizards engaged in long running,
complicated discussions with religous fervour that simply overwhelm
you, remember that there will always be newcomers struggling in
silence to insert their first row into their first table. So, if you
have just written a squash ladder in PHP and mySQL, go ahead and share
your knowledge.</p>

<p>If you can&#8217;t think of anything to say, say nothing. Don&#8217;t be afraid of
radio silence. Personally, I don&#8217;t bother with sites offering
solutions for writers block such as &#8216;99 subjects to blog about&#8217; as I
am not really interested in your response to &#8216;If you were an animal,
what would you be and why ?&#8217; [ Although curiously enough I was asked
exactly this question at interview once ! ]</p>

<p>Think about your favourite Web sites and blogs and why they are of
particular interest to you. If you love reading about long haired
Persian cats, and you have a long haired Persian cat, then write about
that as it&#8217;s likely that this will appeal to a group of people with
similar interests.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t get discouraged because no-one comments on your blog or
nominates you for &#8216;Top 100 Blogs&#8217;. Think of all the blogs you have
read in the last week with interesting, valuable content where you
never had the common courtesy to take the time to say &#8216;Thanks&#8217;.</p>

<p>Finally, think carefully about any brilliant ideas that surface while
under the influence. Your audience may enjoy it immensely but you
might live to regret it.</p>
