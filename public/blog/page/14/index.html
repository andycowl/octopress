  <div class="entry-content"><p>As we meandered our way through Western Australia, we took a taxi from
the rather mediocre accommodation provided by &#8217;<a href="http://www.oceanlodge.com.au/">Ocean
Lodge</a>&#8217; to Broome airport to fly back
home via Darwin.</p>

<p>As we turned a corner on a deserted road, an Aboriginal woman and her
daughter crossed the road in front of us. They looked up before crossing
and walked quickly across the road towards a school. It would have been
courteous for the taxi driver to have slowed down but he maintained his
speed and turned to me in the passenger seat:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;Damn - missed &#8216;em. Maybe next time, eh ?&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>I simply couldn&#8217;t believe my ears. I looked at the driver&#8217;s smiling face
and replied:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;Still - they were here first, weren&#8217;t they ?&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>An awkward silence followed. I could feel my wife&#8217;s eyes drilling into
the back of my head and even the children looked a little uncomfortable
at the chilly atmosphere.</p>

<p>Cogs slowly turned. The driver paused and then retorted:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;Yeah - they were here first alright but that doesn&#8217;t mean they should
get an allowance to keep four dogs though.&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;d dearly love to end the story with how I pointedly waited for the
racist, ignorant taxi driver to slowly and laboriously count out every
last 10 cents of my change for a $12.20 fare.</p>

<p>But I didn&#8217;t - I gave him $15, grabbed our four heavy bags from the boot
and got out of that cab as fast as I possibly could.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Of course, unfortunately, there is another less attractive side to
<a href="http://nbrightside.com/blog/2009/08/07/aboriginal-culture">Aboriginal
culture</a>.</p>

<p>When I last visited Australia in 1990, we took a flight to Alice
Springs. Back then, Uluru was more commonly known as Ayers Rock and
people were freely able to climb the massive sandstone rock. I used to
be quite proud of the fact that I had scaled Ayers Rock and written:
&#8216;Nice view, bit busy, could use an ice-cream stall&#8217; in a tatty visitors
book on the summit. Now the rock has subsequently and rightfully been
returned to the local Aboriginal communities who view it as a sacred
site, I am almost ashamed of the fact.</p>

<p>Twenty years ago, en-route to Alice Springs we saw small groups of
Aboriginals congregating in dry creeks, drinking and obviously under the
influence of alcohol and we heard that sometimes, they perished when the
rains came and the creeks flooded. On this visit, we also saw small
clusters of Aboriginals on parkland, sitting, chatting, drinking and
occasionally shouting and arguing.</p>

<p>Now this behaviour can be (understandably) intimidating to tourists but
to be honest, I walked straight past and the Aboriginals didn&#8217;t pass me
a second glance. They didn&#8217;t speak to me, they didn&#8217;t harangue me, they
didn&#8217;t ask me for money. In fact, I&#8217;ve had more hassle off beggars in
the South Bank underpass at Waterloo station in London.</p>

<p>It was as if we simply didn&#8217;t exist and in many ways, I suspect they
probably wish we didn&#8217;t. Not in their country anyway.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In the last week of the great Australian adventure, we took a guided
tour from Kununurra to Broome, in a 4x4 truck, visiting Purnululu
National Park and the Bungle Bungles.</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.co.uk/lh/photo/8OxjG4AwCyTYe9eOxm96pw?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_l2uGy1RGCiE/SnvVrXDc_uI/AAAAAAAABYI/P8aT2DBCMV4/s400/IMGP1532.JPG" alt="image" /></a>
The scenery was fantastic, the company was great and our guide was
interesting, professional, humorous and knowledgeable.</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.co.uk/lh/photo/Rsu7UaRl7ODO-ABeOS-IAw?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_l2uGy1RGCiE/SnvWp3FngNI/AAAAAAAABYM/mw-9tg97xmo/s400/IMGP1542.JPG" alt="image" /></a>
One day, we also took another boat trip and a bushwalk at Fitzroy
Crossing with an Aboriginal guide.</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.co.uk/lh/photo/m3956X694AYz7fGPAY0bRw?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_l2uGy1RGCiE/SnvaBzBIYLI/AAAAAAAABYY/qKW2dp2s310/s400/IMGP1635.JPG" alt="image" /></a>
The Aboriginal guide was fascinating. He talked about Aboriginal
culture, the importance of Dreamtime, respect for the environment,
respect for each other, how Aboriginals lived off the land for 40,000
years, the extended kinship model, the need to take just what you want
and not what you need. In fact, there are so many areas we could learn
from the Aboriginal culture.</p>

<p>At night, we were able to gaze up into a beautiful, dark, crystal clear
sky. I was amazed to be able to clearly see the Milky Way, Venus and
identify various constellations in the night sky. Then one of my new
found Aussie friends broke the silence with a statement that staggered
me and made me pause for thought:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;Of course, the Aborigines don&#8217;t look at the stars. They look at the
spaces between the stars.&#8217;</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yet another service in the overcrowded blog comment field is
<a href="http://js-kit.com/">JS-Kit</a> who already have a conventional outsourced
blog comment capability (similar to IntenseDebate and Disqus).</p>

<p>JS-Kit recently
<a href="http://blog.js-kit.com/2009/07/10/comments-have-evolved-introducing-echo/">announced</a>
an extension to the service called &#8217;<a href="http://js-kit.com/echo/">Echo</a>&#8217;
which also includes any fleeting reference to your blog post, refreshed
in real-time from other services like Twitter, FriendFeed, Google Reader
and Facebook.</p>

<p>Echo isn&#8217;t generally available to mere mortals yet. Yes, you guessed it
- it&#8217;s limited beta, invitation only and curiously, you need a Twitter
account to even request an invitation.</p>

<p>However, if your name is Michael Arrington, Guy Kawasaki, Robert
<a href="http://scobleizer.com/2009/07/23/commenting-just-changed-for-bloggers-with-js-kit-echo/">Scoble</a>
or Duncan
<a href="http://www.inquisitr.com/32041/why-were-giving-js-kits-echo-a-shot/">Riley</a>,
you are entitled to use the service which is fair enough as it works
best for high volume sites with lots of comments</p>

<p>However, look at this
<a href="http://www.inquisitr.com/32198/twitter-sued-for-patent-infringement-and-it-doesnt-look-good/">example</a>
on The Inquistr of Echo in action on a live site.</p>

<p>Wow - just look at all those &#8216;comments&#8217;. Look again closely. Most
entries are not comments at all. They are merely links or retweets to
the article from Twitter or FriendFeed. The vast majority merely echo
the main headline with no additional comment or insight.</p>

<p>Look again and try to find any meaningful comments where people are
actually commenting on the post and expressing their opinion. Guess
what. The vast majority are mostly classified as &#8216;via Comments&#8217;.</p>

<p>So, that&#8217;s three reasons, I won&#8217;t be installing &#8216;Echo&#8217; on this blog.</p>

<ol>
<li>I don&#8217;t use Twitter.</li>
<li>It adds no value.</li>
<li>No-one ever comments anyway.</li>
</ol>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I passed through many customs, immigration and security checks at
various Australian airports in the last three weeks.</p>

<p>Each airport has its own variant on a dire warning that reads:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;Flippant, amusing or sarcastic remarks will not be tolerated.
Offenders may be subject to a $500,000 fine and/or 10 years in jail&#8217;.</p></blockquote>

<p>Of course, we didn&#8217;t tell Norman Junior III that. My - how we all
laughed when he followed our advice and proudly (and loudly) announced
to the customs official at Brisbane airport.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After I finally got over the shock of Michael Jackson (I suspect Mr.
Pharmacist with the white pills and syringe in the study) and being
genuinely saddened at the recent death of Sir Bobby Robson, I&#8217;m not sure
I can take any more.</p>

<p>Just heard some really crap news. Benson, the world&#8217;s largest living
carp, is no longer living.</p>

<p>Benson, who loved disco dancing, weighed 64 lbs and was between 20 and
25 years old (apparently, Benson lied about his age a lot - similar to
Jane Fonda) has
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/cambridgeshire/8183080.stm">died</a>.</p>

<p>The cause of death is unknown at this time but Michael Jackson&#8217;s doctor
has not been eliminated from police inquiries. Benson had been caught 63
times which he used to carp about endlessly to local fishermen.</p>

<p>It is possible that one angry angler threw some unsalted Nobby&#8217;s Nuts
into the lake which may have been responsible for Benson&#8217;s demise as he
had a nut allergy and preferred spicy &#8216;Chilli Heatwave&#8217; Doritos.</p>
