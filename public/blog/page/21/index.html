  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have tried many times, in many different places, to articluate the
idea that micro-blogging reduces ones blogging output but <a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/blog/about">Russell
Beattie</a> completely expresses
my thoughts on the subject in this brilliant
<a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/blog/tweets-kill-that-blogging-urge">article</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;Tweeting totally takes away that blogging urge from me&#8230; Once I
tweet about something, it&#8217;s like it disappears from my mind
completely.&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>I can completely identify with this statement and another sentence also
struck a resounding chord with me:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;Tweets have no archival value of any sort&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>I think this is so true. Occasionally, I may dig up an old blog post to
refer to. Why sometimes, in a lonely hotel room, I may even just scan my
blog archives - just for my own enjoyment.</p>

<p>However, I never, ever revisit any of my inane drivel posted on Twitter,
Jaiku or even identi.ca. As I once (apparently)
<a href="http://twofishcreative.com/michael/blog/2008/04/02/knowing-people">remarked</a>
to Michael&#8230;</p>

<blockquote><p>I used to enjoy blogging a lot more and I actually have a couple of
humourous blog articles that I am genuinely quite fond - no more than
that - proud of.</p>

<p>Twitter is just the ultimate in &#8216;disposable&#8217; blogging. All that crap
posted from Heathrow T5 just fills my time in. It&#8217;s hardly earth
shattering, is it ? God - I can&#8217;t remember any of those stupid tweets
(apart from the lads in <a href="http://andyc.tumblr.com/post/30359550/12-men-clad-in-yellow-lyrca-bound-for-munich-from">Yellow
Lurex</a>
suits that was pretty funny) let alone be proud of all those throwaway
one-liners.</p></blockquote>

<p>That&#8217;s not to say micro-blogging doesn&#8217;t have a place or isn&#8217;t valuable,
merely that proper, grown up blogging has more value and longevity which
makes perfect sense. The more you put in, the more you get out.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>[ This post also had working titles of &#8216;Friends, bloggers and
countrymen&#8217; and &#8216;anti-social networking&#8217;. ]</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, a gentleman called
<a href="http://waveydavey001.jaiku.com/">WaveyDavey001</a> was kind enough to
invite me to participate in a Fantasy Football League.</p>

<p>Rather rudely, I attempted to invite several of my friends into the same
League so I only needed to manage one team. WaveyDavey001 politely
agreed with the caveat; &#8216;I&#8217;d like to vaguely <strong>know</strong> most (of them)&#8217;.</p>

<p>This innocuous, throwaway comment started me thinking about the nature
of relationships on all these social networks.</p>

<p>WaveyDavey001 only &#8216;knows&#8217; me from Jaiku. He knows I support Manchester
United and knows I like football. Therefore, just like any clever
marketeer, he knew it was possible I might be interested in a Fantasy
League.</p>

<p>The only biographical details I have published on Jaiku are that I am
from &#8216;London, near England&#8217;. I also publish an avatar on all social
networks but this is merely a picture of Alan Partridge dressed up as a
drug crazed zombie, caked in flour. This often leads to disappointment
when people meet me in the flesh.</p>

<p>If you followed my various online presences for a period of time and/or
trawled through the archives, you could probably gather lots more
information about me (where I live, who I work for, my age, my marital
status, my full name) but that would just make you a stalker and I could
get a restraining order.</p>

<p>Now <a href="http://twofishcreative.com/michael/blog/">Michael C Harris</a>
maintains that every single utterance on Jaiku, Twitter, identi.ca,
FriendFeed (et al) is divulging information about me - my interests
(football, music, tennis, software, blogging etc), my attitude, my sense
of, err, humour, and, of course, he&#8217;s absolutely right. Michael sums it
up succinctly in this related
<a href="http://twofishcreative.com/michael/blog/2008/04/02/knowing-people">post</a>:
&#8216;The body of tweets is indicative.&#8217;</p>

<p>I have encountered various, interesting, humourous, friendly, helpful
people since I started blogging three years ago and yet I still really
struggle with what to call these people - friends, mates or blogging
acquaintances.</p>

<p>A long time ago, one of my earliest and longest standing blogging
acquaintances, <a href="http://internetducttape.com/">engtech</a>, made a comment
on a blog where he referred to me as a &#8216;friend&#8217; and I was genuinely
quite taken aback.</p>

<p>I have never met most of my &#8216;blogging acquaintances&#8217; in person. I
haven&#8217;t spoken with most of my &#8216;blogging acquaintances&#8217;. I don&#8217;t know
what most of my &#8216;blogging acquaintances&#8217; actually look like.</p>

<p>To me, a friend is someone you have met in person and shared a pint
with. A friend is someone you could rely on.</p>

<p>I suspect the social networking equivalent of &#8216;sharing a pint&#8217; would
probably be Instant Messaging. Most of my relationships start with
comments on blogs and may subsequently develop into email contact and
occasionally conversations on IM.</p>

<p>And the point of all this ? Well - I&#8217;m not too sure but this post has
been gathering dust in the dark recesses of my mind and hogging an entry
in &#8216;Drafts&#8217; for far too long. Plus the Partridge-esque title was simply
too good to resist.</p>

<p>What do you call your blogging acquaintances ? Is my attitude to
&#8216;friends&#8217; simply typical British self-reserve ? Or am I a tortured soul
prone to over analysis and introspection ?</p>

      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>Disqus recently released a
<a href="http://blog.disqus.net/2008/08/12/introducing-the-new-disqus/">update</a>
which includes the ability to export comments on a WordPress blog so I
have just exported all historic comments left on this blog (when it was
running WordPress) into Disqus.</p>

<p>This operation was slightly complicated because this blog now uses
Habari but the necessary steps were:</p>

<ol>
<li>Download and install the new Disqus 2.0
<a href="http://media.disqus.com/disqus-wordpress-2.0.zip">plugin</a> for
Wordpress.</li>
<li>Delete all obvious spam so the export only processes genuine
comments and runs faster.</li>
<li>Switch the archived WordPress copy of the blog back to the original
location.</li>
<li>Export all comments from WordPress into Disqus.</li>
<li>Claim comments left by myself using an alternative email address
before I had even heard about Disqus.</li>
<li>Wrap the WordPress blog in cling-film, label and place back into
cryogenic storage.</li>
<li>Reinstate the Habari blog.</li>
</ol>


<p>However, because I am pretty stupid and overly hasty, inevitably I
omitted step 3. This meant that while all comments appeared on the
Disqus site, the permalinks to the individual blog articles were
incorrect and referenced &#8216;/wordpress/&#8217; instead of &#8216;/blog/&#8217;.</p>

<p>As it wasn&#8217;t obvious how to rectify this issue or perform a selective
bulk delete so I could repeat the process, I sent an email to Disqus
support explaining the problem and asking for help.</p>

<p>24 minutes later, Jason from Disqus emailed me saying he&#8217;d fixed all the
URL&#8217;s.</p>

<p>What a fantastic service. What a fantastic product. What fanastic
people.</p>

<p>So now I can put the kettle on and reaquaint myself with 886 comments
(including some old friends) that have now been restored to their
rightful place.</p>

<p>The only gap that remains is that a relatively small number of comments
left on my blog after the Habari migration and prior to the adoption of
Disqus are not currently visible. Hopefully, when the Disqus API is
fully released, even this may be possible.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Holidays are a time blissfully free of the modern distractions of
computers, mobile phones, games consoles, televisions and a time for the
family to spend some quality time together and eventually fall out.</p>

<p>Inevitaby, this leads to varied, interesting, thought provoking
discussions. During the Brightside annual vacation in Venice, the
following thorny questions were posed:</p>

<ul>
<li>If you immersed yourself in a foreign country, how long would it
take for you to become proficient in the language ?</li>
<li>If there was a 15 km stretch of beach resort including hundreds of
young people, bars and restaurants in England, how many riot police
would be required ?</li>
<li>If soldier ants are so damn clever, how come they didn&#8217;t land on the
moon first ?</li>
<li>When the bus was forced into that emergency stop, was it the German
tourist or the Italian bus driver who screamed &#8216;BASTARD&#8217; ?</li>
<li>What&#8217;s the Italian for &#8216;Cornetto&#8217; ?</li>
<li>If mosquitoes could be trained to attack people with the same blood
group, would the bites be rendered harmless ?</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><ul>
<li>Look for people with similar interests.</li>
<li>Look at the friends of people you have just followed.</li>
<li>Look out for people who have criteria for following others e.g. &#8216;I
will only consider following you if you have ever replied to me (and
made me laugh out loud)&#8217;. Satisfying the first is easy, the latter
less so.</li>
<li>Scan the Public time line. Occasionally, you will find a gem in the
fast flowing river.</li>
<li>identi.ca currently doesn&#8217;t have an &#8216;Import my friends&#8217; but they
will undoubtedly use the same old tired nickname with the same old,
tired profile pic.</li>
<li>Old technology, admittedly but you could email an invite to friends
who might be interested.</li>
<li>Never, ever unsubscribe from anyone. This is easy on identi.ca as
this is not currently supported..</li>
<li>Use <a href="http://tweetscan.com/indexi.php">searches</a> to find like-minded
individuals talking about common subjects of interest.</li>
<li>If you stumble across interesting content on another service
(FriendFeed, blog, Twitter) with a link to their identi.ca profile,
follow them.</li>
<li>Blindly follow anyone who replies to your posts.</li>
<li>Look out for people located close to you (town, county, country).</li>
<li>Do not troll for followers on other services although subtle,
understated evangeliism may prove worthwhile.</li>
<li>Do not, ever, under any circumstances, beg or plead for followers.</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In my job, I am often summoned into very important, high powered
meetings at short notice. It doesn&#8217;t matter what I am doing, who I am
doing it with or where I am, I simply have to make my apologies and
leave.</p>

<p>Last week, a client took this approach to conducting business to
extremes. I was standing at the urinals, fondly remembering previous
posts on
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/05/11/standing-at-the-urinals">manners</a>
and officious, distracting and confusing corporate
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/07/06/just-do-what-you-are-told-2">directives</a>.</p>

<p>As I attended to business, a gentleman in a dark suit, no tie (yes,
you&#8217;ve guessed it - &#8216;Dress Down Friday&#8217;) and wearing a rather
incongruous pair of white trainers, came into the adjacent stand.</p>

<p>&#8216;Hi, David. Listen - just a quickie. I just want to check that we&#8217;ve
covered all bases before the call at 3:30&#8217;</p>

<p>I looked down. Thankfully, I hadn&#8217;t covered all bases and everything had
landed in the urinal. If only she could have witnessed this, Norma Jeane
would have been so proud.</p>

<p>&#8216;OK Dave. That sounds cool but Debenture will be on the call so I just
need to check we are all aligned.&#8217;</p>

<p>I looked down. We weren&#8217;t really aligned that well. Subconsciously,
uncomfortable at my noisy, immediate neighbour, I had slightly turned
away. Acceding to his plea for corporate alignment and strategic
business partnerships, I re-aligned myself by facing forward.</p>

<p>&#8216;Listen David - I don&#8217;t think your team really appreciate the enormity
of the matter in hand here.&#8217;</p>

<p>I snatched a surreptitious glance sideways - above average perhaps -
certainly not enormous but then Norma Jeane does say that men do tend to
exaggerate a little.</p>

<p>&#8216;David - look if we don&#8217;t get any joy in the next 25 minutes, we are
going to have to escalate this to the very highest levels.&#8217;</p>

<p>Well, I would probably describe what I had just experienced as &#8216;relief&#8217;
rather than &#8216;joy&#8217;.</p>

<p>Pause. Bliss. Peace at last.</p>

<p>&#8216;David - are you still there ? Speak up. The reception is this place is
appalling - it&#8217;s as if I am calling from a toilet. Absolutely.
Unfortunately, the worst case scenario does mean dragging Anthony into
this.&#8217;</p>

<p>What did this idle threat mean ? Was the mysterious &#8216;Anthony&#8217; was going
to be summoned from cubicle #3 to join us in a Holy Triumvarate ?</p>

<p>&#8216;Hey Dave - I fully understand your position but I am going to have to
drop off the call now.&#8217;</p>

<p>With that, the important man in the suit and white trainers, equipped
with the Borg headset, ended the call, shook hands with the unemployed,
pulled his zipper up and left the Gents urinals.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>On Friday, Norman Junior III and myself loaded up our picnic hamper,
packed the cool box with brightly coloured Bacardi Breezers and set off
for SW19.</p>

<p>We had been lucky enough to get tickets for Wimbledon tennis in the
public ballot <a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/07/01/under-the-covers-at-wimbledon">last
year</a>
but, thanks to the English weather, we only saw grey skies and 63
minutes of play. It was scant consolation that we saw Maria Sharapova in
the flesh. OK, I&#8217;ll admit it - that was a massive consolation !</p>

<p>This year, we applied again in the public ballot and we got lucky. Very
lucky. We were allocated Centre Court tickets for Friday 4 July, the day
of the Men&#8217;s Semi Finals. Or as those posh stewards from the Wimbledon
Championships prefer to call it, the &#8216;Gentleman&#8217;s Singles&#8217;</p>

<p>We used my own private and exclusive &#8216;Park &amp; Ride&#8217; scheme which entails
parking on a residential road and walking through Wimbledon Village,
admiring the beautiful people, en-route to Wimbledon Tennis Club on
Church Road.</p>

<p>After clearing security, (&#8216;No sharp objects just ham &amp; cheese rolls&#8217;) we
wandered around the outer courts which were hosting doubles and junior
matches. We saw the world&#8217;s sporting journalists and TV crews setting up
in the media centre, had a look at Aorangi Terrace - sorry &#8216;Henman Hill&#8217;
- sorry &#8216;Murray Mount&#8217; and gazed at hundreds of people, soaking up the
sun and the atmosphere, preparing to watch matches on a very big screen.</p>

<p>Norman Junior asked why Wimbledon was charging a staggering 85 pence for
a Toffee Crisp and &pound;2.60 for a bag of Maynard&#8217;s Wine Gums. I told him it
was so the LTA can pay off the rest of Brad Gilbert&#8217;s contract and
finish the retracting roof.</p>

<p>At 12:30, we took our seats on Centre Court and were delighted to
discover we had brilliant seats on row 10, to the left of the umpire&#8217;s
chair, bathed in brilliant sunshine.</p>

<p>Roger Federer against Marat Safin was the first match and Federer did
indeed look impressive in his cream cardigan, with five gold embosssed
buttons (signifying the number of his Wimbledon triumphs). Federer beat
Safin in straight sets and he&#8217;s an awesome player. It must be soul
destroying to play against Federer as the guy never seems to make a
mistake and barely seems to be exerting himself. Safin tried manfully
but rarely looked like breaking Federer&#8217;s serve and, after losing a
second set tie-break and smashing a racket on his chair, Safin
understandably lost heart and Federer triumphed 6-3, 7-6, 6-4.</p>

<p>After a quick break to play &#8216;Spot the Celebrity&#8217; in the Royal Box
(Prince Michael of Kent, Des Lynam, Michael Parkinson and Trevor
Macdonald), it was time for Rafael Nadal. When Norman Junior III asked
me for my prediction, I loudly said &#8216;It will be close but I&#8217;m going for
Schuettler in four sets&#8217; which drew some puzzled looks from our
immediate neighbours.</p>

<p>Nadal is a big man and taller than I imagined. He is very strong,
athletic and muscular. In fact, I think he has muscles on top of his
muscles. Nadal swept into an early 3-0 lead after breaking the serve of
the German, Rainer Schuettler. The game looked like it could be an
embarassing, one -sided affair but credit to Schuettler who actually
broke Nadal&#8217;s serve and was on top in the second set. Nadal came back
though and levelled to take the set into another tie-break. Inevitably,
just like Federer and like a true world class sportsman, Nadal went up a
gear and won the tie-break (and the match) easily.</p>

<p>We finished our cheese and cucumber sandwiches, drained our flask of
tea, cracked open our packet of Wine Gums (60p from Asda), took some
more photos and watched one set of Mixed Doubles (Jamie Murrary) before
making our way home to try to (successfully) spot ourselves on the TV
highlights.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Although it&#8217;s very cool to post on the corporate message board: &#8216;Hey -
why don&#8217;t we save the company millions of dollars by using Linux, Gmail
and OpenOffice ?&#8217;, there are obvious barriers (security and Excel
luddites to name but two) to large corporations adopting server based
software.</p>

<p>However, I always thought Google Mail would be an obvious fit for
academic institutions to reduce the costs of software licenses and IT
management. Adoption of such &#8216;software as a service&#8217; would make sense as
although some students are &#8216;late risers&#8217;, the majority could also be
classified as &#8216;early adopters&#8217; who are comfortable with the technology.</p>

<p>This recent
<a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/06/23/15-million-australian-students-dump-outlookexchange-for-gmail/">announcement</a>
that the Department of Education in New South Wales will roll out (a
customised version of ) Google Mail to 1.5 million students is an
interesting development.</p>

<p>The cost of the new system will be $9.5 million as opposed to the $33
million for the previous Exchange/Outlook based solution with students
getting an increased quota of 6GB (previously a miserly 35MB).</p>

<p>Although the initial contract is purely for email services for students
only (no Google Talk), the obvious extension is to include Google
<a href="http://nbrightside.com/blog/2007/06/28/google-finally-sees-sense">Docs</a>
and Spreadsheets to displace Microsoft Office.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Two weeks ago, I made my annual
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/06/11/surbiton-trophy">pilgrimage</a>
to the Surbiton Trophy where I enjoyed a day in the sun watching an
excellent Men&#8217;s Final between Frank Dancevic and Kevin Anderson.</p>

<p>Norman Junior III also plays tennis at Surbiton albeit not to such a
high standard. In the lull between the main event and the Men&#8217;s Doubles
Final, Norman Junior III and the juniors came on to entertain a handful
of spectators on the two main courts, performing some standard drills
with their coaches.</p>

<p>After two hours on court on a blisteringly hot day, I expected the
<a href="http://www.lta.org.uk/News/All-news-items/Dacenvic-Wins-Mens-Title-in-Surbiton/">winner</a>,
Frank Dancevic, to hoist the trophy for the obligatory photo, pocket his
cheque and beat an hasty retreat to get a shower and a cold drink.
However, much to my surprise, Dancevic joined in with the boys and girls
playing with some 6 year olds on a quarter size court with orange balls.</p>

<p>Dancevic was absolutely brilliant with the kids, laughing and joking and
even throwing in some grunts if he struggled to make a return. He then
rallied with some up and coming teenagers who were very keen to score a
point off the professional. Even after the fun session was over, Frank
still made more time available to chat and sign the kids&#8217; tennis bags.</p>

<p>Last night, on Court 1 at Wimbledon, there was a minor
<a href="http://www.wimbledon.org/en_GB/news/match_reports/2008-06-23/200806231214250890687.html">shock</a>
as Frank Dancevic beat David Nalbandian in straight sets (6-4, 6-2,
6-4). Nalbandian was the 7th seed for Wimbledon while Dancevic is ranked
98 in the world and unseeded.</p>

<p>Well played Frank and good luck in the next round against Bobby
Reynolds.</p>
