  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last night at approximately 18:12, I turned right onto the A4 (Great
West Road) heading in an easterly direction towards Chiswick when I
noticed a white police van behind me with flashing headlights and blue
light spinning.</p>

<p>The police van pulled out to overtake me, then suddenly pulled back into
my lane and pulled up to a halt to assist a broken down vehicle which
had hazard lights on and was stationary in the nearside lane.</p>

<p>I now had to pull out to overtake the police van. The driver of the
police van kindly wound down his window and waved me on my way of an
apology for cutting me up with no warning.</p>

<p>Then I noticed a two car shunt on the other carriageway that was causing
havoc with Westbound traffic on one of London&#8217;s main routes out of the
city.</p>

<p>Thankfully, the eastbound A4 was virtually clear so I carried on. I
remarked to Norma-Jean how brilliant it was for the kindly policeman to
stop and help out the driver of broken down vehicle on a dark, cold
night. I told her the Metropolitan Police do a superb job under
difficult conditions and should be praised not continually criticised.</p>

<p>Then I saw the same police van screaming up behind me with the blue and
white lights flashing.</p>

<p>With the innocence of youth, Norma Jean asked: &#8216;Dad - he&#8217;s not flashing
at us, is he ?&#8217;</p>

<p>I reassured my young daughter &#8216;Oh no - he has just noticed the accident
of the other side and is trying to get there as quick as he can so he
needs to get to the next roundabout to turn around. Either that or
they&#8217;re late for their tea.&#8217;</p>

<p>Only he wasn&#8217;t attending the accident on the other carriageway. He was
pulling me over. My heart sank.</p>

<p>I told Norma the Metropolitan Police were a corrupt organisation, filled
with officious police officers, convicting innocent people, while
letting guilty criminals roam free and the Met Police are always picking
on innocent, law abiding drivers and she should never, ever trust them.</p>

<p>Time for quick thinking. I turn the radio off (Kiss FM - Norma Jeane&#8217;s
choice not mine) and ask Norma Jeane to wind the window down as we
prepare for an encounter with the Metropolitan Police.</p>

<p>And so it begins&#8230;</p>

<p>&#8216;Good evening, Sir&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Listen mate, enough of the pleasantries. I&#8217;m in a hurry. What the hell
have you stopped me for ? Shouldn&#8217;t you be out catching murderers ?&#8217;</p>

<p>No, no, only joking. &#8216;Good evening officer.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;re aware, Sir but I have stopped you because you
just jumped a red traffic light back there.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What do you mean ? It was amber and I was stuck in no-man&#8217;s land so I
had to proceed. Anyway, this is London not a country village.&#8217;</p>

<p>No, no, only joking. &#8216;Yes I know, officer. I&#8217;m really sorry about that.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;There were three vehicles that jumped the red light. Every single one
of you illegally jumped the red light and not one of you noticed the
police van sitting behind you waiting patiently at the red light.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yeah well - if that underpowered transit had got any acceleration, you
could have come through behind us too.&#8217;</p>

<p>No, no, only joking. &#8216;Yes I know, officer, I&#8217;m really sorry.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;&#8230;and when I attempted to stop you, you then proceeded to drive away.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes I know, officer, I&#8217;m really sorry. I genuinely thought you were
attending to that two car shunt back there.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes. Well I wasn&#8217;t. It&#8217;s just a good job you stopped this time. Barry
wanted to activate the loudspeaker system and I&#8217;m sure you, or your
lovely daughter, wouldn&#8217;t have wanted that, would you, Sir ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes I know, officer, I&#8217;m really sorry.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Listen to me, Sir. We have already had three deaths on the roads in
London tonight so we are just asking people to drive carefully.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I see officer. I will certainly drive more carefully now.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;OK. I&#8217;ve warned the other two drivers so now I am warning you. Please
drive carefully, Sir. Good-night.&#8217;</p>

<p>And with that, the flashing lights were turned off, Barry sighed with
disappointment and he departed, content to let me off with a warning.</p>

<p>Which was just as well as I am currently on six penalty points for two
separate speeding offences both incurred in Watford.</p>

<p>Understandable really though. You&#8217;re so relieved to get away from that
awful town, you do tend to put your foot down.</p>

<time datetime="2007-11-20T23:44:34+00:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Nov 20<span>th</span>, 2007</time>
        
         | <a href="/blog/2007/11/20/comparison-of-cocomment-cocomments-and-commentful/#disqus_thread">Comments</a>
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I subscribe to multiple blogs (163 to be precise) and Google Reader
makes tracking all of those sites trivial. Reader&#8217;s keyboard shortcuts
mean scanning for new content and reading blog articles is also easy and
quick.</p>

<p>Occasionally, I also leave comments on a much smaller subset of those
blogs in addition to blogs I may encounter but may not necessarily
subscribe to.</p>

<p>After posting your comment, it is imperative to be able to follow any
subsequent discussions in case someone violently (dis)agrees with you or
simply to hear other people&#8217;s viewpoint on the same subject.</p>

<p>So how do you track all those insightful, witty comments you have
contributed during your travels on the blogosphere ? How do you monitor
all those interesting conversations, heated discussions and outright
flame wars that you haven&#8217;t necessarily contributed to but are still
interested in ?</p>

<p>The primeval solution is to bookmark and subsequently revisit every
single blog article you have commented on and, err, scan for any new
comments. However, this isn&#8217;t a very efficient solution and you may find
you have no time left for reading the blogs (or holding down the day
job) let alone leaving comments.</p>

<p>Another possibility is to subscribe to the comments feed for all the
blogs you comment on. However, this may be overkill as you may only be
interested in certain articles of interest or articles where you posted
a comment.</p>

<p>For example, some articles on popular, high volume blogs (Scoble,
ProBlogger) may receive over a hundred comments but I am only interested
in tracking comments on a relatively small number of posts.</p>

<p>Some blogs offer &#8216;Subscribe to comments via email&#8217; but this is not
universally available.</p>

<p>A deluxe version would enable me to track follow-ups to my specific
comments on blog platforms that support threaded comments.</p>

<p>My main requirements for comment tracking are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Easy, quick way to track comments on a blog. Fully automatic if
possible and certainly not more than one click.</li>
<li>Ability to select comment threads to be monitored.</li>
<li>Ability to stop tracking conversations.</li>
<li>Must be able to track all blog platforms.</li>
<li>Automatic notification when comments updated.</li>
<li>Ability to check for updates manually.</li>
<li>Visual indicator for threads with updated content.</li>
<li>Must support RSS feeds to track comment threads.</li>
<li>RSS feed must include the context (blog, date, comment text and
author)</li>
</ul>


<p>The main three comment tracking services are:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.cocomment.com">co.Comment</a></li>
<li><a href="http://commentful.blogflux.com/">commentful</a></li>
<li><a href="http://co.mments.com">co.mments</a></li>
</ul>


<p>[<a href="http://sezwho.com/">SezWho</a>, <a href="http://disqus.com/">Disqus</a> and
<a href="http://www.intensedebate.com/">IntenseDebate</a> offer similar services
but require installation of plug-ins on the server to be truly universal
so are excluded but you may find these tools are of interest.]</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>All three sites require (free) registration and use a Firefox
bookmarklet to track comment threads. No additional plug-ins are
required on the server.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>Each site has a home page displaying tracked conversations.
<a href="http://lh4.google.com/nbrightside/R0LJkEzVCJI/AAAAAAAAARo/2I8oJUepXK0/commentful-home.PNG?imgmax=640" title="commentful-home.PNG"><img src="http://lh4.google.com/nbrightside/R0LJkEzVCJI/AAAAAAAAARo/2I8oJUepXK0/s144/commentful-home.PNG" alt="commentful-home.PNG" /></a></p>

<p>commentful provides a dashboard displaying all conversations of
interest. Threads with unread comments are highlighted in bold. Only the
number of comments is shown and to read the actual comment, you need to
click through to the original site. This is less than ideal as for sites
with lots of comments, you have to waste time scanning for the recent
updates.</p>

<p><a href="http://lh3.google.com/nbrightside/R0LMb0zVCMI/AAAAAAAAASE/oGWLWBP71s0/co.mments-home.PNG?imgmax=640" title="co.mments-home.PNG"><img src="http://lh3.google.com/nbrightside/R0LMb0zVCMI/AAAAAAAAASE/oGWLWBP71s0/s144/co.mments-home.PNG" alt="co.mments-home.PNG" /></a></p>

<p>co.mments has a excellent, simple, uncluttered summary page displaying
the tracked threads with new content clearly displayed. You can read the
additional comments simply by expanding the thread. The context
including the blog name, the date and time and the author of the new
comments are displayed.</p>

<p>One (minor) problem is that threads are listed in reverse chronological
order so recent threads with no updates appear above older threads with
active conversations.</p>

<p><a href="http://lh4.google.com/nbrightside/R0LJkEzVCLI/AAAAAAAAAR4/59j5XKxPNFo/coComment-home.PNG?imgmax=640" title="coComment-home.PNG"><img src="http://lh4.google.com/nbrightside/R0LJkEzVCLI/AAAAAAAAAR4/59j5XKxPNFo/s144/coComment-home.PNG" alt="coComment-home.PNG" /></a></p>

<p>The coComment &#8216;My Conversations&#8217; page is a little more complicated.
Comments may be viewed by expanding the appropriate comment thread and
the author is shown although the date and time are not included.</p>

<p>coComment seemed a little slower to pick up new content than both
commentful and co.mments.</p>

<p>Both commentful and co.mments allowed a &#8216;Check&#8217; button to force a poll
for new comments which is a feature coComment doesn&#8217;t support.</p>

<p>coComment added a lot of social and community features in version 2.0.
It is fair to say that these Web 2.0 features were not universally
welcomed by the existing user base.</p>

<p>coComment allows you to examine comment threads tracked by &#8216;neighbours&#8217;
(people who presumably are tracking similar conversations&#8217; and you can
subscribe to other users&#8217; tracked threads. Personally, I don&#8217;t have a
need for this feature but I can see how it would be useful for
discovering new, relevant blogs of interest. However, your Web 2.0
mileage may vary.</p>

<p>Intriguingly, I have one stalker - sorry follower - on coComment but am
I able to click to discover his/her profile ? No. Maybe this is the dawn
of anti-social networking.</p>

<p>coComment also has a sidebar view to displays conversations with the
original blog displayed alongside but the interface is a little busy for
my liking.</p>

<p><a href="http://lh6.google.com/nbrightside/R0LPOkzVCNI/AAAAAAAAASM/NplqboqeP0c/coComment-sidebar.PNG?imgmax=640" title="coComment-sidebar.PNG"><img src="http://lh6.google.com/nbrightside/R0LPOkzVCNI/AAAAAAAAASM/NplqboqeP0c/s144/coComment-sidebar.PNG" alt="coComment-sidebar.PNG" /></a></p>

<h2>Tracking comments</h2>

<p>All three comment tracking services use a Firefox/IE bookmarklet to add
a blog post to be tracked. commentful and co.comments display the
confirmation message and helpfully disappear. Unfortunately, the
coComment window persists and has to be explicitly closed Breaching the
one click rule).</p>

<p><a href="http://lh6.google.com/nbrightside/R0L61kzVCOI/AAAAAAAAASs/8UdVRVXDmaE/commentful-added.PNG?imgmax=640" title="commentful-added.PNG"><img src="http://lh6.google.com/nbrightside/R0L61kzVCOI/AAAAAAAAASs/8UdVRVXDmaE/s144/commentful-added.PNG" alt="commentful-added.PNG" /></a><a href="http://lh4.google.com/nbrightside/R0L8VEzVCRI/AAAAAAAAATI/iYsB20yfG_U/co.comments-added.PNG?imgmax=640" title="co.comments-added.PNG"><img src="http://lh4.google.com/nbrightside/R0L8VEzVCRI/AAAAAAAAATI/iYsB20yfG_U/s144/co.comments-added.PNG" alt="co.comments-added.PNG" /></a><a href="http://lh6.google.com/nbrightside/R0L61kzVCQI/AAAAAAAAAS8/SzfeYIjZq6s/coComment-added.PNG?imgmax=640" title="coComment-added.PNG"><img src="http://lh6.google.com/nbrightside/R0L61kzVCQI/AAAAAAAAAS8/SzfeYIjZq6s/s144/coComment-added.PNG" alt="coComment-added.PNG" /></a></p>

<h2>Notification</h2>

<p>coComment provides a Firefox plugin that provides automatic notification
in the browser. However, the current version (0.2.3.6) proved unreliable
for me using Firefox 2.0.0.8 on Windows XP. In fact, I actually had to
explicitly disable the coComment extension in order to add conversations
using the bookmarklet. In addition, the plugin broke some Google
Analytics functionality.
commentful also installs a Firefox notifier (1.7.3) that turns Amber
when new comments are available. Clicking on the notifier icon opens a
window containing the Watchlist. The notifier only updates every 15 mins
so once you have read all new comments, confusingly the notifier doesn&#8217;t
immediately revert to Green (no new comments).</p>

<p>Thankfully, co.comments doesn&#8217;t include a fancy comments notifier.
Probably just as well.</p>

<h2>RSS</h2>

<p>Of course, checking a Web page to check on the status of blogs you have
commented on is pretty tiresome. Even with the help of a notifier
application. What intelligent, lazy people really want is an RSS feed
that tells them when important changes have occurred.</p>

<p>All three services offer RSS feeds for the monitored conversations.</p>

<p><a href="http://lh5.google.com/nbrightside/R0MEVEzVCSI/AAAAAAAAATw/Do-88VMziU0/commentful-RSS.PNG?imgmax=640" title="commentful-RSS.PNG"><img src="http://lh5.google.com/nbrightside/R0MEVEzVCSI/AAAAAAAAATw/Do-88VMziU0/s144/commentful-RSS.PNG" alt="commentful-RSS.PNG" /></a></p>

<p>Like the Watchlist, the RSS feed from commentful just contains the blog
title together with number of new comments. You have to visit the site
layout: post
comments: true
to view the newly added comments. This rather defeats the purpose of the
RSS feed because ideally, you want to be able to view as much content as
possible from within Google Reader. The only time you might visit the
site would be to participate in the conversation (i.e. someone said you
were an idiot).</p>

<p><a href="http://lh4.google.com/nbrightside/R0MEV0zVCTI/AAAAAAAAAT4/Bh5SBTM5OwY/co.mments-RSS.PNG?imgmax=640" title="co.mments-RSS.PNG"><img src="http://lh4.google.com/nbrightside/R0MEV0zVCTI/AAAAAAAAAT4/Bh5SBTM5OwY/s144/co.mments-RSS.PNG" alt="co.mments-RSS.PNG" /></a></p>

<p>The co.mments RSS feed contains everything needed for context (author,
blog, comment, date).</p>

<p><a href="http://lh5.google.com/nbrightside/R0MEWEzVCUI/AAAAAAAAAUA/eaPzwV6xrMU/coComment-RSS-comments.PNG?imgmax=640" title="coComment-RSS-comments.PNG"><img src="http://lh5.google.com/nbrightside/R0MEWEzVCUI/AAAAAAAAAUA/eaPzwV6xrMU/s144/coComment-RSS-comments.PNG" alt="coComment-RSS-comments.PNG" /></a></p>

<p>coComment offers the usual separate RSS feed containing updates on all
tracked conversations although the author appears to be &#8216;unknown&#8217; most
of the time. I presume this is &#8216;unknown&#8217; to the coComment system because
the author details are supplied on the actual comment.</p>

<p>CoComment does have a additional feature which is useful. coComment
provides a second RSS feed purely contains the individual comments you
have posted. This is very useful if you are intending to add all your
words of wisdom to a lifestream style page (Tumblr, FriendFeed).</p>

<p><a href="http://lh6.google.com/nbrightside/R0MEWUzVCVI/AAAAAAAAAUI/xKYg9rW591A/coComment-RSS-author.PNG?imgmax=640" title="coComment-RSS-author.PNG"><img src="http://lh6.google.com/nbrightside/R0MEWUzVCVI/AAAAAAAAAUI/xKYg9rW591A/s144/coComment-RSS-author.PNG" alt="coComment-RSS-author.PNG" /></a></p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>commentful is basic but does the job and will save you time if you
merely want to be automatically notified when new comments have been
added to a blog post. However, you do have to visit the site to identify
and read the new content.</p>

<p>coComment is the most feature rich and potentially powerful tool but the
complexity of the interfaces and wealth of social networking features
are slightly overwhelming for my simple requirements. However I will use
the RSS Comment Author feed to track my own comments. Once I&#8217;ve worked
out why it has stopped working.</p>

<p>co.mments - simple and functional. The RSS feed contains precisely the
information I need and is updated quickly. This is the tool I am now
using (via RSS) to monitor all comment threads of interest.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just installed <a href="http://sezwho.com/">SezWho</a> on this blog. At least, it
imported all existing comments (unlike
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/10/31/disqus-powered-comments/">Disqus</a>).
I would like to change the red colour to blend in with the theme but
haven&#8217;t worked out how.</p>

<p>Now just rate each other nicely or you will be sent to bed without any

comment.</p>

<p>Another interesting service but, again, the problem is that it needs to
be installed on the majority of blogs/wikis/forums in the world to be
truly useful. I think marketeers call it &#8216;traction&#8217;. Pity the support

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am still in shock at not being shortlisted for the &#8217;<a href="http://2007.weblogawards.org/polls/best-uk-blog-1.php">Best UK
Blog</a>&#8217; but I
decided to swallow my pride and enjoy a few hours enjoying the high
quality content of the 10 finalists:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://iaindale.blogspot.com/">Ian Dale&#8217;s Diary</a> - A tagline of
&#8216;Commentary, analysis and gossip from the heart of Westminster&#8217;
completely turned me off and I closed the Firefox tab before I was
subjected to any more torture.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.order-order.com/">Guy Fawkes</a> - Hoping for top tips to
blow up the Houses of Parliament but just got more politics. Yawn.</li>
<li><a href="http://neilclark66.blogspot.com/">Neil Clark</a> - The winner
apparently. Anti-war hack with a lot of posts urging readers to vote
for him.</li>
<li><a href="http://eureferendum.blogspot.com/">EU Referendum</a> - Simply couldn&#8217;t
summon up the enthusiasm to click through.</li>
<li><a href="http://pubphilosopher.blogs.com/">Pub Philosopher</a> - Promising
title but yet more (right wing) politics. May as well buy the Daily
Mail.</li>
<li><a href="http://devilskitchen.me.uk/">The Devil&#8217;s Kitchen</a> - Considered
outpourings on the wit and wisdom of David Cameron. No thanks.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.baggagereclaim.co.uk/">Baggage Reclaim</a> - Much better. A
blog recording amusing anecdotes from an anonymous baggage handler
at LHR. Oh no - wait a minute - it&#8217;s just a blog about dating and
&#8216;relationships&#8217;.</li>
<li><a href="http://nourishingobscurity.blogspot.com/">Nourishing Obscurity</a> -
Promising title but this excerpt completely lost me: &#8216;I see that the
current crop of parents lost their moral compass long ago and this
is the first generation to grow up &#8220;moral-code-lite&#8221;.</li>
<li><a href="http://brightmeadow.co.uk/">Bright Meadow</a> - Soft porn alert &#8216;She
loved how the amber glinted off his bones&#8217;. I daren&#8217;t read any more.
Particularly as I am on a formal warning from my employer.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.kickette.com/">Kickette</a> - At last. A discerning blog
all about football. Only this one is about celebrity footballers
(Fat Frank), their tiresome girlfriends and pictures of Ronaldo with
his shirt off.</li>
</ul>


<p>I was so depressed that I decided to <del>kill myself</del> compile my own
list of the definitive, real, undisputed &#8216;Top 10 UK (and Irish) blogs&#8217;
in strict alphabetic order:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I decided to save Oracle Corporation lots of money by not attending
Oracle Open World in San Francisco. Initially, my manager spent a lot of
time trying to dissuade me but as soon as he uttered the words &#8216;Billy
Joel&#8217; and &#8216;Prince&#8217;, I immediately volunteered for some billable work in
Sunderland to help pay for Doug&#8217;s complimentary red sleeping
<a href="http://oracledoug.com/blog/index.php?/archives/1327-A-New-Comfy-Seat-for-The-Boys-and-Polly-....html">bags</a>.</p>

<p>Doug
<a href="http://oracledoug.com/serendipity/index.php?/archives/1342-yaaisfb.html">Burns</a>,
Tim
<a href="http://www.oracle-base.com/blog/2007/11/12/openworld-arrival-and-day-1/">Hall</a>
and John
<a href="http://jes.blogs.shellprompt.net/2007/11/11/gotta-love-jetlag/">Scott</a>
seem to have a real problem conquering jet lag while Mark
<a href="http://www.rittmanmead.com/2007/11/12/first-days-at-oracle-open-world-2007/">Rittman</a>
just does &#8216;the British thing and goes down the pub&#8217;. While I don&#8217;t
travel to the States that often, I did attend a Microsoft training
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/05/02/further-afield/">course</a> in
Seattle last year. As I don&#8217;t sleep on planes, I do recall being quite
tired when we disembarked and slightly annoyed when my colleague
volunteered to navigate and let me concentrate on driving.</p>

<p>However, after checking into the
<a href="http://www.starwoodhotels.com/whotels/property/overview/index.html?propertyID=1154">hotel</a>,
having a walk around the lovely harbour and getting something to eat, I
remember feeling pretty good. In fact, after a couple of drinks, I was
ready put my Amex card behind the bar but my colleague insisted on
dragging me back to my bedroom screaming &#8216;But we must go to bed at
22:09&#8217;</p>

<p>Anyway to OOW; Oracle Apps Lab
<a href="http://oracleappslab.com/2007/11/11/mix-is-live/">launched</a> Oracle
<a href="https://mix.oracle.com/">Mix</a> which is a version of an internal Oracle
networking site (which I am ashamed to admit I only discovered recently)
and there is a short
<a href="http://blogs.oracle.com/otn/2007/11/12#a1132">discussion</a> about
Oracle&#8217;s gradual adoption of such networking and community tools. I must
say I preferred the name &#8216;Connect&#8217; to &#8216;Mix&#8217; but still, if anyone wants
to link up, you know where to find me.</p>

<p>Andrew Clarke has a typically British and impartial
<a href="http://radiofreetooting.blogspot.com/2007/11/oow2k7-whats-story.html">review</a>
on Larry Ellison&#8217;s opening keynote while Eddie Awad has recorded some
fun micro-<a href="http://awads.net/wp/tag/openworld07/">interviews</a> with Oracle
staff and bloggers alike. Interesting to put a face and voice to people
I only know from their Internet presence.</p>

<p>The other announcement thus far of note is <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technologies/virtualization/index.html">Oracle
VM</a>.
Virtualisation is a strong growth area (I meet lots of Siebel customers
deploying or planning to use VM) and this is an obvious market for
Oracle to enter to complement <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technologies/linux/index.html">Enterprise
Linux</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Norman - Your next post will be in the style of Micro-Blogging&#8230;</p>

<p>Monday - NSCR. Plaintive request from a customer to truncate a Siebel
intersection table. Siebel&#8217;s official stance on the use of <strong>any</strong>
direct SQL to modify data in Siebel base tables is well
<a href="http://www.digitalteddy.com/techblog/2007/10/why_direct_sql_is_a_very_stupi.html">documented</a>.
However, for reasons that are too lengthy and tedious to divulge here,
this particular request was approved. Mainly because they deposited
&pound;2500 into my offshore account.</p>

<p>Tuesday - Team Meeting at
<a href="http://www.oracle.com/global/uk/corporate/locations/birmingham.html">BVP</a>.
Interesting to hear what my counterparts on eBusiness Suite do. Ate
<a href="http://www.solihull-online.com/tiggis.htm">here</a>. Not as dire as the
reviews suggested. Few beers in the interests of team morale.</p>

<p>Wednesday - Try (and fail) to avoid being dispatched abroad on my
birthday. Cristiano Ronaldo keeps going till the very last minute and
gets his
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/7076590.stm">reward</a>. A
lesson to us all.</p>

<p>Thursday - Early start. Sleep downstairs on the sofa bed. Wake up 3
hours early. Fly to Amsterdam. Mundane Production Health Check for
Siebel 7.7 on SQL Server. Set up various monitoring tools (perfmon, OM
logging and
<a href="http://databasediskperf.blogspot.com/2006/06/finding-top-10-long-running-queries.html">Profiler</a>)
to identify low hanging fruit. There wasn&#8217;t any. Staying close to
Schipol (good), far away from the city (bad).</p>

<p>Back to

  <div class="entry-content"><p>London - 5 November 2007</p>

<p>The football world was left reeling after Norman Brightside was fired
last night. The long serving manager of Whiteside Wanderers was
summarily dismissed when the club released a terse statement on their
website.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;36 points. That&#8217;s rubbish. You&#8217;re fired.&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>After a pre-season of great promise, big money transfers and high
expectations from fans, Whiteside Wanderers have endured a poor start to
the season and are positioned second from bottom after a string of
inconsistent performances and bad results.</p>

<p>Brightside defended his record: &#8216;Don&#8217;t look at me. Look at the players.
They just haven&#8217;t performed. The team has continually been wracked by
injuries (Scholes, Rooney), suspensions (Ronaldo, Carsson) and loss of
form (Berbatov).&#8217;</p>

<p>The Chairman offered a slightly different view: &#8216;The manager&#8217;s lost it.
He has made some bizarre selections (Noble, McShefferey). His stubborn
refusal to even contemplate the purchase of a Liverpool or Manchester
City player was the last straw. I negotiated a deal with Liverpool to
get Gerrard for &pound;56 million but he refused. The man is a stubborn idiot
and is living in a fantasy world.&#8217;</p>

<p>Brightside was left fuming at claims he had &#8216;lost the dressing room&#8217;.
&#8216;That&#8217;s absolutely absurd. The dressing room is on the right just after
the toilets. I can find it with my eyes shut.&#8217;</p>

<p>Brightside was coy about his plans for the future and refused to confirm
or deny rumours of a &pound;7.50 pay-off. The tabloid press are convinced he
will team up with Sammy Lee and take over at managerless Stevenage, a
Subbuteo team languishing in the Ryman Premier League.</p>

<p>&#8216;Some think Stevenage would be a retrograde step but there&#8217;s great
potential there. Besides, Sammy wants to go somewhere where the players
look up to him.&#8217;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Q: Who on earth could manage to screw up a Cup draw involving just four
teams ?</p>

<p>A: The <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/scot_cups/7072638.stm">Scottish
FA</a>.</p>

<p>Reminds me of a funny Not The Nine O&#8217;Clock News sketch where the draw is
made for the FA Cup Final.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;Number 2 - Arsenal &#8230;will play</p>

<p>Number 1 - Liverpool
and that completes the draw for the FA Cup Final. &#8217;</p></blockquote>
