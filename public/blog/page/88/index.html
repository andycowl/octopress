  <div class="entry-content"><p>Days Inn Hotel. No restaurant service &#8216;because it is Christmas&#8217;. No
cooked breakfast &#8216;because it is Christmas&#8217;. No Sky Sports which is
normally available but has been withdrawn &#8216;because it is Christmas&#8217;.
Boddingtons is available despite the proximity of &#8216;Christmas&#8217; at a very
reasonable 2.95 GBP for a pint.</p>

<p>The Marksman hostelry, a mere half a mile away, but a little more
earthy, has Sky Sports at every booth and on big screens and sells
Stella Artois for 2.20 GBP per pint.</p>

<a href="http://smallbusiness.yahoo.com/webhosting/problogs.php?p=BALLOON">Yahoo!</a>
will be offering WordPress hosted blogs for small businesses and
charging a monthly fee for the service.</p>

<p>I think this is good news for all WordPress users (.com and .org) as it
provides a revenue stream for future development.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Some professional (but impecunious) bloggers feel it is very important
that there should be a regular, repeating cycle to the frequency of your
blog articles to capture the hearts and minds of your tens of readers.</p>

<p>Thankfully, I am a mere amateur so I will post when I feel like it and
have prolonged periods of radio silence when I feel like it.</p>

London.</p>

<p>The Killers themselves desperately wanted to take part.</p>

<p>Harvey Goldsmith couldn&#8217;t find room to accommodate The Killers in the
running order because of problems about the closing time and the
provision of police/ambulance/London transport cover for a late ending
at Hyde Park.</p>

<p>Eventually, The Killers played one song on another band&#8217;s kit at Live 8
in sharp suits to save time on the changeover.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am fortunate that my job takes me to lots of exotic locations (Prague,
Bergen, Amsterdam, Munich, Oslo, Nice, Paris) and now, err, West
Bromwich.</p>

<p>The last time I was here was in October 1981 when I attended a game at
The Hawthorns between West Bromwich Albion and Manchester United. The
game got underway and the United fans started a chant:</p>

<blockquote><p>Oh I do like to be beside the seaside
Oh I do like to be beside the sea</p>

<p>Oh I do like to walk along the prom, prom, prom</p>

<p>And say, GO HOME West Brom</p></blockquote>

<p>Only, &#8216;Go Home&#8217; was substituted for a different, more colourful phrase
in the English vernacular to the same effect.</p>

<p>Anyway, as the game was pretty uneventful, the United fans kept
repeating the last line ad infinitum which was quite funny.</p>

<p>Next thing I knew, a policeman grabbed hold of me and my mate and
escorted us both down the steps to the pitch, through a gate and led us
away.</p>

<p>I was stunned into silence but my mate was more vociferous repeatedly
asking &#8216;What had we done ?&#8217;. This was understandable as he was a
Brighton fan who had just come along for something to do and wasn&#8217;t even
singing.</p>

<p>We got led away alongside the pitch, past the United fans who applauded
us (for some odd reason) and were taken to the police control room. The
copper asked us for ID and took our names. He then cautioned us. We
protested that we had done nothing and weren&#8217;t even singing the obscene
chant.</p>

<p>To my amazement, the copper said &#8216;Yeah. I know but we had to do
something to quieten things down&#8217;</p>

<p>Then I realised that we had been ejected from a football match because
we happened to be standing adjacent to an aisle (easy access for the
coppers without having to pull us from the middle which might provoke
more trouble), the coppers knew we were together as a pair (and not in a
larger group) and precisely because we were not the types to be cause
trouble.</p>

<p>We were then kicked out into Handsworth Road where youths were lobbing
stones into the United section and the copper warned us &#8216;Listen. You&#8217;ve
been cautioned. But if you enter the ground again and I see you, you
will be arrested&#8217;.</p>

<p>So we ran the gauntlet of stones back to the station. As we did so,
inevitably we heard loud cheering from the away end.</p>

<p>We got home and were soon <del>safely wrapped up in our beds</del> back in the
pub, drinking hard, regaling our friends with the anecdote in the pub as
we learned the final score. 3-0 to United.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The Akismet spam filter included with WordPress.com means I am not
troubled by comment spam on my blog at all, ever.</p>

<p>However, I recently reviewed the spam sitting there all alone in
quarantine. Most was inviting me to sample all sorts of delights
describing all manner of different and very imaginative ways that a man
and (wo)man can be joined together.</p>

<p>One spam comment stood out head and shoulders above all others though
with a blissfully simple but effective, marketing message.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So Typepad had plans to implement resilient disk storage but had an
<a href="http://www.sixapart.com/typepad/news/2005/12/typepad_update.html">outage</a>
before the work was complete, which meant that users lost access to
their treasured blogs as a consequence.</p>

<p>Elsewhere del.ico.us celebrated the Yahoo! takeover by having an
<a href="http://blog.del.icio.us/blog/2005/12/continued_hiccu.html">outage</a> that
also meant that users lost access to their bookmarks.</p>

<p>I also noticed that the transaction log on the database used by
Newsgator filled up over the weekend and the forums were also
unavailable this morning.</p>

<p>My UK ISP appears to have suddenly been taken by surprise by a slight
increase in users which has
<a href="http://www.blueyonder.co.uk/status/serviceissue.do?ticket=295784">broken</a>
their email infrastructure causing sporadic access to email for a period
close to seven days. Isn&#8217;t anyone at Blueyonder responsible for capacity
planning ?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just downloaded an interesting, wide ranging
<a href="http://www.podleaders.com/matt-mullenweg-podcast/">interview</a> (sorry
podcast) by Tom Raftery with Matt Mullenweg and Donncha O&#8217;Caoimh, the
two leading developers behind WordPress. Matt and Donncha talk about
their backgrounds, hosted WordPress.com, features in 2.0, blogging,
spam, plugins and future WordPress developments.</p>

<p>Tom also happened to ask a specific question about my concerns for the
WordPress business model and Matt provided some reassurance that there
is a revenue stream through partnerships (hosting companies) so both
guys do have enough money to eat, drink Murphys and wear clothes.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am using the Newsgator Online RSS reader and simply want to order my
most important, must-read blogs (i.e mine) at the top. It doesn&#8217;t seem
like an unreasonable requirement. From a cursory glance at the
documentation, it is not immediately clear if I can even do this in
Newsgator. This is a little irritating as I now have to do some work to
scroll down to &#8216;Oracle&#8217; or rename the folder as &#8216;AAAOracle&#8217;. And, yes,
you&#8217;re right, I am very lazy.</p>

<p>Then I stumbled across a blog article on
<a href="http://www.searchfox.com/">SearchFox</a> which is another Web based RSS
reader (like Newsgator) but with an interesting personalisation and
recommendation engine which automatically bubbles your favourite, most
frequently read articles and blogs to the top of your reading list.</p>

<p>This sounds interesting. It is a pity that SearchFox is another Web 2.0
application that is in beta and currently open to a selected few who
must apply for an account. Still, I sent them a polite email citing my
recent review and asked for access to evaluate their product. I even
used a Gmail address to prove my Web 2.0 credentials. I sent the email
yesterday and am now polling my Google Inbox every ten seconds.</p>

<p>I stumbled across SearchFox on a arbitrary blog search on
<a href="http://www.feedster.com/">feedster</a> about RSS and it struck me that, in
the past, I would use Google (Web, Groups), TuCows, SourceForge,
Freshmeat to find OpenSource, free RSS readers.</p>

<p>However most of these sources are relatively out of date and had failed
to unearth SearchFox when I was recently looking for RSS readers. The
fast moving blogosphere is much better suited to finding these sort of
hip, new Web 2.0 applications.</p>
