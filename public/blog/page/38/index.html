  <div class="entry-content"><p>I always had a lot of time for the outgoing Manchester City manager,
Stuart
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/man_city/6655007.stm">Pearce</a>.
Well his press conferences and musical tastes, anyway.</p>

<p>However, I have a horrible feeling in the pit of my stomach that, in
seven weeks, Manchester City Football Club are going to appoint a
foreign manager.</p>

<p>This appointment will come after the City board initially go after &#8216;big
Sam Allardyce&#8217; and offer to rename him &#8216;MASSIVE&#8217;. City are shocked to be
rejected by Allardyce who has already
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/n/newcastle_united/6654121.stm">signed</a>
up at Newcastle and is merely arguing over additional ex-gratia payments
in brown bags to be exchanged at Washington services on the A1.</p>

<p>Unabashed, the chairman glibly assumes that timing of Paul Jewell&#8217;s
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/w/wigan_athletic/6653185.stm">resignation</a>
at Wigan is more then coincidental and quickly arranges a meeting. Paul
Jewell tells him: &#8216;Look - I am at the end of my tether. The relegation
battle left me a broken man. My doctor says I am on the verge of a
nervous breakdown. I have been advised to take a 2 year break from
football. I would have to be completely mad to take over at City&#8217;. &#8216;Oh
so I take it that&#8217;s a &#8216;No&#8217; then, is it ?&#8217;</p>

<p>The City board of directors then appoint Francis Lee to lead the
increasingly urgent hunt for Pearce&#8217;s successor. His first effort is
rebuffed by a City old boy - Steve Coppell. &#8216;Err - I only lasted 6
matches in 1996 for &#8216;personal reasons&#8217; and, in any case, I&#8217;m working for
a big club now.&#8217;</p>

<p>In desperation, the vice-chairman suggests a radical strategy -
appointing the untried Joey
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/6627567.stm">Barton</a> as
player manager to instill some much needed &#8216;fighting spirit&#8217; in the
team. This is opposed vehemently by City fans who conclusively vote 23-6
against in a poll conducted in the Manchester Evening News.</p>

<p>An emergency board meeting is convened to discuss with just two items on
the agenda:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is Sven Goran Eriksson fully paid-up by England yet ?</li>
<li>AOB - Noel Gallagher&#8217;s offer.</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Amusing
<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/05/11/nsatnav11.xml">story</a>
in Friday&#8217;s Torygraph about how a Sat Nav system left a poor, helpless
20- year old female student marooned on a level crossing in the face of
a high speed train.</p>

<p>Thankfully, this woman escaped with her life and will probably sue
<a href="http://www.tomtom.com/">TomTom</a>, her boyfriend and Carlos Tevez.
However, Paula Ceely is so unbelievably stupid, hopefully she will
manage to secure an early nomination for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin_Awards">Darwin
Awards</a> imminently.</p>

<p>The online version of this story omits a crucial section - the picture
of the warning sign that was clearly displayed on the level crossing
that was included in the newspaper edition.</p>

<ol>
<li>Check that the green light shows</li>
<li>Open both gates</li>
<li>Check that the green light still shows</li>
<li>Cross quickly</li>
<li>Close both gates</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Many years ago, in a parallel universe, I created a
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010525033911/http://www.andy-cowling.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/">Web</a>
page that proclaimed:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;The fastest, most comprehensive Web search engine -
<a href="http://www.altavista.com/">AltaVista</a>&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>With the increasing domination of
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/10/30/the-only-search-engine-in-town/">Google</a>,
it really is difficult to remember life back in the days when AltaVista
was the only search engine in town and you were even considering sinking
500 quid of your hard-earned into the rumoured
<a href="http://www.itweek.co.uk/vnunet/news/2112349/altavista-europe-hints-ipo">IPO</a>.
Maybe one day, another startup will come along and usurp Google&#8217;s #1
position but somehow, I sincerely doubt it.</p>

<p>And if that search engine company turns out to be
<a href="http://uk.ask.com">Ask</a>, I hereby pledge to eat my underpants and buy
everyone a season ticket at Manchester City (with complimentary powder
blue and white scarf).</p>

<p>Duncan Riley of TechCrunch already posted an excellent
<a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/05/04/ask-is-the-algorithm-working/">summary</a>
on Ask&#8217;s current, abysmal marketing campaign in the UK.</p>

<p>Listen, if you want to get ordinary people to use your search engine,
don&#8217;t use some subtle, understated, pretentious campaign (&#8216;Evolve Your
Search&#8217;) with pictures of Neanderthal man, costing millions of dollars,
dreamt up by new media luvvies, wearing black shirts and no ties.</p>

<p>Ordinary people don&#8217;t say: &#8216;Ooh - that looks very interesting indeed. I
wonder if that advert is a cryptic reference to a new, exciting search
engine technology which will undoubtedly to help me find relevant stuff
quickly on the Interweb. The Ask brand has now been subconsciously
planted in my mind and I simply must remember to discuss this topic with
the lads at work tomorrow.&#8217;</p>

<p>Ordinary people say: &#8216;God there&#8217;s some rubbish adverts on TV these days.
Fancy a cup of tea, love ?&#8217;</p>

<p>Believe it or not, technically minded people have already heard of Live,
Ask and Google and all those
<a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/the_top_100_alt_search_engines_april07_update.php">niche</a>
search engine players (incorporating Web 2.0 semantics).</p>

<p>Believe it or not, those technically minded people are in a tiny
minority. They don&#8217;t know it but they are.</p>

<p>You are not trying to get their attention. There&#8217;s no point. They look
down their nose at you. The only time they use Ask.com is the final
choice to determine how many inbound links their tiresome blog has this
week.</p>

<p>No, you are trying to get the attention of millions of desperate
housewives, builders and silver surfers who have never heard of Google
and have to ask their 12 year old son to dig up that Web site for
holiday cottages in the Dordorgne. These people don&#8217;t use IE7 and type
their searches directly into the address bar.</p>

<p>A much better campaign would have been:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;Trying to find something on the Internet ? Go to ask.com.&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>Black text on white background. Short and to the point. Quicker and
therefore considerably cheaper and it probably would have delivered
better results than this
<a href="http://www.marketingpilgrim.com/2007/05/google-market-share-up-again.html">report</a>
from Hitwise suggests .</p>

<p>Well, let&#8217;s face it - my campaign couldn&#8217;t have been much worse; 3.69%
market share and a staggering 13% down year on year). Come on Ask, only
another 62% before you overtake Google.</p>

<p>So, don&#8217;t Ask, just Google. Like everyone else.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Like most newly born WordPress.com bloggers, I keenly played with all
the features and tirelessly experimented with the rich variety of
horrendous 1, 2 and 3 column
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/08/08/wordpress-theme-competition/">themes</a>.</p>

<p>Then, I left home and bought a domain name from a geezer in the pub. The
downward spiral continues into self-hosting and mixing with the wrong
crowd. Inevitably, I stayed up late, dabbled in alcohol and drugs while
installing every single
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/11/07/plugin-extravaganza/">plugin</a>
and widget ever created for WordPress.</p>

<p>You start taking ProPlus, pulling all-nighters and, unbelievably, start
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/01/29/how-to-rotate-taglines-on-your-wordpress-blog/">hacking</a>
PHP code.</p>

<p>Then, I grew up and became a man. I bought some slippers from M&amp;S
together with a pipe and grumbled away at the television (&#8216;You can&#8217;t
even hear what they are singing&#8217;).</p>

<p>The stunning <a href="http://www.plaintxt.org/themes/barthelme/">Barthelme</a>
theme was left unaltered. The platform was stable but you quickly run
out of ready-made, cheap blogging material. Apart from a brief dalliance
with
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/04/18/goodbye-pmetrics/">pMetrics</a>,
Google <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics">Analytics</a> silently continues
to accumulate data, statistics, lies and damned statistics. You start to
sleep in the afternoons and go to bed after the News.</p>

<p>Even the recent announcement of a WordPress
<a href="http://wordpress.com/blog/2007/05/06/stats-plugin/">statistics</a> plugin
for self-hosted blogs couldn&#8217;t rouse me from my blissful slumber. Why
bother with all that pesky download, upload, configuration and
activation nonsense wasting valuable time and effort when Google
Analytics will probably be
<a href="http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/2007/05/google-analytics-is-re-launched-do-these-five-things-first-in-v2.html">revamped</a>
with colourful dashboards and a usable interface tomorrow ? And so it
came
<a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2007/05/whole-new-experience-for-google.html">pass</a>.
Yet another triumph for apathy.</p>

<p>Life was good. And then Scott Wallick had to spoil it by announcing a
major <a href="http://www.plaintxt.org/2007/02/17/so-whats-new/">overhaul</a> of
all his brilliant WordPress themes including
<a href="http://www.plaintxt.org/wp-content/uploads/barthelme_v30_readme.html">V3.0</a>
of the Barthelme theme. As the current version is an embryonic 1.2.2,
you can&#8217;t resist this temptation. After months of inactivity, you now
simply have to act.</p>

<p>So you reluctantly risk RSI by typing on a keyboard again. You have to
endure the tortuous download, upload and configuration process. Then you
have to use the left side of your tiny brain to merge your
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/10/10/improving-on-perfection/">changes</a>
only to discover that the blog looks exactly the same and only a CSS
purist could tell the difference.</p>

<p>Everything that is apart from the &#8216;Related Posts&#8217; widget which is now
completely broken. You hesitate and consider conducting an exhaustive
(and exhausting) search for a WordPress
<a href="http://lorelle.wordpress.com/2007/02/21/blog-navigation-wordpress-plugins-related-recent-most-popular-posts-and-more/">alternative</a>
that is compatible with Barthelme 3.0.</p>

<p>Then inertia holds sway, so you give up and reinstate the perfectly
functional (if outdated and unfashionable) stunning Barthelme 1.2.2 and
slump back in your chair.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The Guardian&#8217;s Rob Smyth has a fascinating
<a href="http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/sport/2007/05/06/where_does_uniteds_title_victo.html">article</a>
where he eats humble pie and ranks Manchester United&#8217;s nine Premiership
titles.
layout: post
comments: true</p>

<p>Curiously enough, I have also given this matter a lot of thought over
the weekend. I place this title second after Alex Ferguson&#8217;s very first
Premiership victory back in 1992-1993. Not because that team was better
(it wasn&#8217;t) but because of all the history, the expectation, the broken
dreams, the false dawns in preceding 26 years and the satisfaction of
lifting the title and finally knocking Liverpool off their
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/11/04/20-years-ago/">perch</a>.</p>

<p>However, I was living in hope rather than expectation for this campaign.
Chelsea had won the title (easily) for the past two seasons and
strengthened further with the summer acquisitions of Ballack and
Shevchencko.</p>

<p>United had significantly paid over the odds for Michael Carrick. I
questioned the wisdom of offloading Ruud van Nistlerooy and feared Paul
Scholes&#8217; best days were behind him. I was convinced
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/08/24/comeback-kid/">Ole</a>&#8217;s next
goal would be in his testimonial and doubted Ferguson&#8217;s assessment of
Patrice Evra ability who I considered no better than Silvestre.</p>

<p>United had a fair share of luck in this campaign; Ferguson&#8217;s squad
remained injury free for the majority of the season, the goalkeeping
error and Neville own goal at Everton, Vassell&#8217;s missed penalty. The
list goes on.</p>

<p>However, United did play some fantastic football this season (Fulham on
the opening day, Roma, Bolton away) and Cristiano Ronaldo&#8217;s first-half
display against Bolton was absolutely superb. Playing and winning the
United way.</p>

<p>Ferguson&#8217;s luck deserted him towards the end of the season with injuries
to a watertight defence coupled with Van der Saar&#8217;s shattered nose (and
confidence). The gulf between the sides in the two legged semi-final
against AC Milan was embarrassing.</p>

<p>If Chelsea had won the title three years in a row, I think the gulf
between them and the rest would have widened still further and been even
harder to bridge. It&#8217;s tempting to think Chelsea were decimated by
injuries mid-season but they actually lost fewer games (3) than United
and have an incredibly strong squad.</p>

<p>The various points totals from each campaign make interesting reading.
United already have 88 points with two games left which is the third
highest total (behind 92 points in 93-94 and 91 in 99-00). I think it
illustrates how high Chelsea have raised the standards required to win
the Premiership and what a fantastic achievement winning it really is.</p>

<p>Up The Reds !</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A blog post in the classic retro style of &#8216;Dear Diary&#8217;. Stay tuned next
week for relationship woes, football reports, psychotherapy, unexpunged
details on my health, teenage angst, my current mood, the music I am
listening to and why I am going to be quiet for the next 13 days.</p>

<p>Or, as Mark E. Smith of The Fall, once said to requests for &#8216;Bingo
Masters Breakout&#8217;</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;Are you still doing what you did 5 years ago ?&#8217;
&#8216;Yeah - well don&#8217;t make a career out of it.&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>Stagger downstairs for breakfast to find an early morning problem. The
Virgin Media
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/03/26/virgin-media-v-downgrade/">V+</a>
box has rebooted overnight only it didn&#8217;t reboot cleanly and is stuck on
the &#8216;Powering up&#8217; screen.
Norman Junior III and Norma Jean have already initiated a disaster
recovery plan and are glued to the standby database (2nd STB).</p>

<p>This is a major worry as the TV <strong>must</strong> be working by 19:45 tonight
otherwise I face the prospect of watching AC Milan vs MUFC in the pub
with a load of ABU&#8217;s (Anyone But United). Politely ask the wife if she
can call &#8216;150&#8217; to try to get it sorted.</p>

<p>Drive to Oracle&#8217;s offices in Thames Valley Park near Reading. I have
done a lot of commuting to customer sites recently but I can&#8217;t work at
home today as I am too nervous. In addition, my wife is also at home and
I need to get some work done (rather than mow the lawn, take a tempting
lunch in a sunny beer garden or diagnose a faulty smoke alarm).</p>

<p>Listen to <a href="http://www.talksport.net/">TalkSport</a> who are dissecting last
night&#8217;s game between Chelsea and Liverpool. My abiding memory of 120
minutes of tedious football is a fat Scouser holding 6 fingers up and
another holding aloft a plastic European Cup.</p>

<p>Plastic Scousers. Plastic treble.</p>

<p>Power the laptop up and yesterday&#8217;s mysterious Windows warning message
&#8216;You may have been a subject of counterfeiting&#8217; has disappeared as
miraculously as it appeared.</p>

<p>Sign into Oracle Instant Chat. I am making a conscious effort to use
this
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/08/04/am-i-a-technology-luddite/">tool</a>
more regularly and more effectively.</p>

<p>Check email using
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2005/08/23/firefox-and-thunderbird/">Thunderbird</a>.
Nothing too important. A colleague is asking for help with a Siebel
query from hell that runs fast in UAT and, wait for it, slow in
production. The query plan and costs are almost identical so the
solution isn&#8217;t immediately obvious. Offer a couple of suggestions (check
data volumes, check statistics and histograms, 10053 trace, Alert 1162).</p>

<p>Quick scan of RSS feeds using Google
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/02/18/resisting-the-lure-of-google-reader/">Reader</a>.
Couple of quick blog posts about &#8216;Leeds, Leeds, Leeds&#8217; and contaminated
curry.</p>

<p>Update document following a comprehensive and thorough peer review.
Deliver final document to account manager. Add a couple of useful notes
to
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/02/27/full-circle/">TiddlyWiki</a>:
Metalink Note 391116.1 (10.2.0.3 Release Notes) and bug 5131645 (high
parse times in Oracle 10.1.0.4).</p>

<p>Microsoft Word livens the morning up by crashing as I click &#8216;Save&#8217; for
the last time. I am not sure what the question is but I am convinced
Microsoft Word is not the answer. I loathe the program with a vengeance.</p>

<p>During the Siebel takeover, rumours were rife that Oracle do not use any
Microsoft products at all. This was supposedly because Larry Ellison
steadfastly refused to pay Bill Gates a single cent in license revenues.</p>

<p>Guess what - this didn&#8217;t prove to be the case. Most desktops and laptops
at Oracle run Windows XP preloaded with Microsoft Office. However,
Oracle do use open standards so employees are free to use the email
client of their choice. Oracle also provide software (Oracle Connector)
to provide an email interface from Microsoft Outlook to accommodate the
sales and marketing department.</p>

<p>Update a second document. This is a much shorter document (site visit
report) with thankfully fewer comments and corrections.</p>

<p>Book flights to Oslo using the online travel system for next two weeks.
I get an &#8216;Exception Report&#8217; because I booked a slightly more expensive
direct flight rather than going via Amsterdam and arriving 3 hours
later.</p>

<p>I am going to Norway on a &#8217;<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/04/30/my-plans-for-the-future/">deep
dive</a>&#8217;
but I have subsequently learned this is a technical training exercise
run by, err, me to provide knowledge transfer and actually perform some
real-life data migration with a Siebel integrator rather than scuba
diving. I have visited this customer before and they specifically asked
for me to return which was a welcome compliment.</p>

<p>Return the favour by reviewing a colleague&#8217;s document (yes I do read and
write a lot of words in my job). He scratches my back and I scratch his
even though it is a little hairy for my taste.</p>

<p>It is now 11:40 and I suddenly realise I have forgotten to turn my
mobile phone on. 2 messages. The first is a scary, schizophrenic,
psychotic madman saying in a dull, menacing monotone &#8216;Get some bloody
work done&#8217;. This unsettles me so much I think it is a Leeds fan, my
manager or a disgruntled Web 2.0 &#8216;A&#8217; lister and I immediately consider
turning the phone off again.</p>

<p>I also have two text messages and a voicemail from my lovely wife,
Norma. &#8216;TV not working. Phone now broken. InterWeb down. Virgin man
coming. Call me&#8217;. This is serious - a complete and catastrophic loss of
digital services. On the night of the European Cup semi-final.</p>

<p>Then I remember. The phone line was very crackly last night so the &#8216;Get
some work done&#8217; message was a test message from myself to myself. Phew.
I am not being stalked after all.</p>

<p>Resume document review.</p>

<p>Interrupted by a call from Frank, the Virgin Media engineer. He is
initially puzzled by my professional business-like greeting: &#8216;Norman
Brightside - Oracle Expert Services. How may I help you grow your
business ?&#8217;</p>

<p>Frank is in his white van, en route to my house and calls me to clarify
which services are working. He wondered if all services are down and
whether some idiot had been doing some overzealous gardening and simply
severed the cable.</p>

<p>I tell him that I am at work but my wife is at home and she reports that
the second TV is still working. I inform him that the last time I did
any gardening was September 1991 but I do possess an
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/04/04/axe-murderer/">axe</a>.</p>

<p>Once again, I stress the importance of the main TV being functional by
19:45 for the most important match of the season. He roars with laughter
and replies he is a very happy Liverpudlian and understands the
importance of the task. I gently enquire whether his tools are made of
plastic. He roars with laughter and holds 6 fingers up (which I can&#8217;t
see).</p>

<p>I work in building 550 alongside a group called &#8216;License Renewals&#8217; who
just do what it says on the tin. The people working here probably bring
more revenue into the company during a single telephone call than I do
in a calendar year.</p>

<p>Then I call the wife and tell her to prepare the metal shackles and
heavy chains. I suggest that she deflates the tyres on Frank&#8217;s van while
claiming to be making him a lovely cup of coffee.</p>

<p>Back to the document review. This is a very detailed review about tuning
Siebel data loads on Oracle 10g. A excellent, comprehensive document
packed with technical information and useful strategies. Make a mental
note to plagiarise most of this material and claim the credit for
myself.</p>

<p>Norma calls again. Frank has fixed the V+ box already. This is
absolutely amazing customer service. What on earth is going on at Virgin
Media ? A engineer onsite within 2 hours of the call and he has already
fixed the first problem.</p>

<p>Frank has also noted some error codes on the diagnostics screen and
offers to replace the V+ box. Before he does so, he wants to ensure I am
happy to re-enter my &#8216;Planned Recordings&#8217; which will be lost. I tell him
to swap the box and I will reluctantly re-program &#8216;Relocation,
Relocation, Relocation&#8217;, &#8216;American Idol&#8217; and &#8217;<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/09/16/dragons-den/">Dragon&#8217;s
Den</a>&#8217;.</p>

<p>Skip lunch in favour of water as I have 4 stone of blubber to sustain
myself.</p>

<p>Stop procrastinating and embark on 4 weeks worth of expenses. A tedious,
unbelievably time-consuming but necessary task involving lots of
receipts, paper jams,
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/06/19/born-of-frustration/">printing</a>,
sellotape, envelopes and photocopying.</p>

<p>Courtesy call to customer I am visiting tomorrow (LoadRunner performance
testing which is normally great fun).</p>

<p>Wife calls. Our hero, Frank, has now resolved the issue with the
telephone line. Apparently, water had damaged one set of cables so he
has re-routed to use the second set. The root cause remains unknown.
Frank suspects the ongoing building work outside which seems a likely
candidate although, confusingly, he agrees the builders have not
interfered with the cables from the road to the house.</p>

<p>Finally prepare to leave office. Need to allow extra contingency of 3
hours to allow for traffic delays, earthquakes, road rage attacks, acts
of God, or M3 lane
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/02/15/undercover-with-surrey-traffic-police/">closures</a>
that could prevent me getting back to my armchair before 19:45.</p>

<p>Everything was just going too well. Inevitably, fate suddenly dealt me a
cruel and unexpected card. I was thwarted by a schoolboy error. In my
rush, I foolishly fed a hotel bill together with a stapled credit card
receipt into the office photocopier. The inevitable paper jam (Lift tray
3, turn green knob, release paper jam) meant lengthy and serious
internal surgery. By the time, I finally extracted the bill, it was in
73 separate pieces. So was the photocopier. So was I.</p>

<p>I called the delightful Malmaison hotel in Oxford to ask for a copy of
my bill. Thankfully, for once, technology came to my rescue. The kind
lady faxed the bill directly to my office extension and it miraculously
appeared in my Inbox as a TIF attachment. I noted that the Malmaison
bill is headed &#8216;DAMAGE&#8217;. Pretentious, moi ?</p>

<p>Conference call with customer about clustering and high availability
options for Siebel.</p>

<p>Finally, the expenses are submitted, the ToDo list and the Inbox are
both empty and I am free to go home. I pick up my complimentary copy of
Oracle Scene on the way out. Yet another perk of working for Oracle. At
least, I hope it&#8217;s complimentary.</p>

<p>With no more distractions, the nerves, the tension, the excitement and
the sense of anticipation slowly continue to build.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Dear Paul</p>

<p>You are 32 years old and a fantastic footballer. You are still producing
moments of breathtaking brilliance (lobbed pass for Rooney versus AC
Milan).</p>

<p>You are one of my
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2005/11/22/barstool-correspondent/">favourite</a>
players at Manchester United. However, let&#8217;s face it. You can not tackle
to save your life. If you get booked and United beat AC Milan tonight,
you will miss your second European Cup Final.</p>

<p>This would be hard for me to take so God knows how you would feel.
Remember how it felt to walk around the Nou Camp in 1999 with Roy Keane
in those grey suits.</p>

<p>If you make two tackles, you are likely to get booked. If you make four
tackles, you are certain to get booked.</p>

<p>So please, please have a word with Alex Ferguson and get Michael Carrick
to concentrate on winning the ball and just pass it to you.</p>

<p>Yours faithfully</p>

<p>Norman Brightside (no relation)</p>
