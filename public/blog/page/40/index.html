  <div class="entry-content"><p>After my recent
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/04/16/letter-from-america/">holiday</a>,
I have been sent on the road for two weeks. I am currently staying at
the (heinously overpriced)
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/03/27/a-cause-for-concern/">Malmaison</a>
hotel in <a href="http://www.malmaison-oxford.com/">Oxford</a>.</p>

<p>This place is very expensive and seems like a gaol for the vertically
challenged. You emerge from reception into a prison wing. If you are
over 5&#8217; 8&#8221; tall, you are forced to duck under the door to enter your
room.</p>

<p>Oxford is not car friendly. That is why you have to pay &pound;20 to park your
vehicle.</p>

<p>Watched Manchester United beat Sheffield United 2-0 at the Market Tavern
hostelry.</p>

<p>The Market Tavern is a curious mix of pretentious Oxford students,
dressed in shorts and flip-flops, discussing philosophy contrasted with
threatening, tattooed hard-cases from the Blackbird Leas estate.</p>

<p>I feared for my life until I spotted the referee of the inevitable
battle who was heavily tattooed but also sported khaki shorts and
flip-flops.</p>

<p>A band was simultaneously playing (practicing ?) upstairs. They had more
fans then Sheffield United and played a curious mix of blues and indie
rock-n-roll until an ill-advised cover of &#8216;Never Mind&#8217; forced their 23
female groupies to depart en-masse for McDonalds.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have been a little quiet recently because I have spent the last two
weeks in Florida during which time I didn&#8217;t see a computer, pick up a

<li>Tie a Vielda cloth to car aerial to keep 3 car convoy together. Tell
the parking valet, this ripped blue and white rag is the flag of the
European Union.</li>
<li>Trip to <a href="http://www.discoverycove.com">Discovery Cove</a>. Much more
civilised (free pints of Pepsi). Experience queue withdrawal

<li>Return to Magic Kingdom for nighttime parade and fireworks. Thirst
for queuing quenched.</li>
<li>Stagger and amaze multiple Disney staff by correctly guessing their
town and state of origin purely from their accents.</li>
<li>Meet an American gentleman who accuses me of &#8216;being Dutch&#8217;, &#8216;not
speaking proper English&#8217; and proudly announces that his
brother-in-law is &#8216;mayor of Packney&#8217;. All in a 28 second ride in a
lift.</li>
<li>Car park attendant at <a href="http://www.seaworld.com">Sea World</a> finally

revenge.</li>

convinced he is joking.</li>
<li>Gain 3 stone as result of outsize American portions. Started to

<li>Key Largo. Superb snorkelling on Banana Reef in <a href="http://www.pennekamppark.com/">John

<li>Put petrol in car. Advanced computer system for automated
self-service payment means I only have to enter garage three times
to complete transaction.</li>
<li>Listen to John Mellencamp, Belinda Carlisle and Foreigner and an
interminable stream of inexorable dross on an array of dreary
(&#8216;Light Rock&#8217;) radio stations. No wonder the US doesn&#8217;t produce any
decent bands.</li>
<li>Return hire car. Failed to tip shuttle driver who gave me a stream
of abuse.</li>
<li>Fly back from Miami airport. Sophisticated on-demand video and
entertainment system functional after a &#8216;master-master reset&#8217;. Play

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just 10 weeks after <a href="http://performancing.com/node/5610">closing</a>,
Performancing Metrics has
<a href="http://pmetrics.performancing.com/help/">risen</a> again, phoenix-like,
from the ashes.</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t use the previous incarnation of this statistics package as I
had a hosted WordPress blog which didn&#8217;t support Javascript. When I
migrated to my own WordPress blog, I used Google
<a href="http://analytics.google.com/">Analytics</a> which is perfect for my
purposes (and free) but I couldn&#8217;t resist installing the new version of
the new statistics package from Performancing Metrics.</p>

<p>The software was really easy to install (two lines of Javascript) in the
footer template. I really liked the real-time updates (better than
Google Analytics which has a 3 hour lag) which are pretty addictive.</p>

<p>The reporting interface is really smooth and polished (the icons look
similar to <a href="http://www.netvibes.com/">Netvibes</a> but I presume these are
in the public domain).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/user/files/2007/03/pmetrics-home.JPG" title="Performancing Metrics Home"><img src="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/user/files/2007/03/pmetrics-home.thumbnail.JPG" alt="Performancing Metrics
Home" /></a></p>

<p>I was expecting high demand as people rushed to download the new
software on day one and sluggish performance. All the reports were very
quick and the system was responsive although with my data volumes maybe
that isn&#8217;t so surprising.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/user/files/2007/03/pmetrics-visitors.JPG" title="Performancing Metrics Vistors"><img src="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/user/files/2007/03/pmetrics-visitors.thumbnail.JPG" alt="Performancing Metrics
Vistors" /></a></p>

<p>In addition to the standard tracking metrics (country, browser,
platform, referrer, search terms), Performancing Metrics also allows you
to analyse the page views, outbound links and path of an individual
visitor which is a nice feature.</p>

<p>The geographic distribution report is integrated with Google
<a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/">Maps</a> which is a nice feature.</p>

<p>Google Analytics is a completely free service (loss leader) but as
Performancing Metrics only charges for over 1,000 page views per day,
this equates to the same thing for my humble blog.</p>

<p>The WordPress
<a href="http://www.semiologic.com/software/google-analytics/">plugin</a> for
Google Analytics automatically filters all accesses from WordPress
Administration screens. This is better than IP filtering as I might use
3 different computers to manage my blog. This would be a neat feature
for a future release of Performancing Metrics.</p>

<time datetime="2007-03-28T10:46:01+01:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Mar 28<span>th</span>, 2007</time>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was staggered to read on
<a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/03/27/yahoo-mail-announces-unlimited-storage/">TechCrunch</a>
that Yahoo! <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com/">Mail</a> has 250 million users while
the much younger and rapidly growing Google <a href="http://gmail.com/">Mail</a>
(beta) service currently has a paltry 51 million users in comparison.</p>

<p>I wonder what proportion of these users, in these impressive headline
(marketing) numbers, actively use the respective services on a daily
basis.</p>

<p>However, I was not surprised at Yahoo&#8217;s offer of &#8216;unlimited&#8217; email
storage which gets a cheap headline and was pretty inevitable. A tiny
minority will gleefully claim they really need infinite storage and
think of inventive ways to upload the entire contents of their PC to a
server. Yahoo! will then ban them for uploading copyrighted material.</p>

<p>While I have a longstanding but rarely used Yahoo! Mail account (which I
was scanning tonight funnily enough searching for my
<a href="http://flickr.com/">Flickr</a> credentials), this announcement won&#8217;t be
tempting me back to Yahoo! just yet. I await with interest Google&#8217;s
response though.</p>

<p>I think the Yahoo! Mail screen is incredibly cluttered and the adverts
on the right hand side are incredibly intrusive and consume valuable
screen estate. As you scroll through Yahoo! emails, the banner ads
actually change which is slow and very distracting !</p>

<p>I know this type of thing is very subjective and, in many cases, ones
preference simply reflects what you are used to and familiar with but I
honestly don&#8217;t know how Doug tolerates it. Also, Google&#8217;s spam filter is
far more effective which is important.</p>

<p>Also, Yahoo! have a irritating tendency to overuse the exclamation mark
as part of the corporate branding. Look at any personalised Yahoo! page
and shriek as you count the shrieks. I suspect you will be unpleasantly
surprised.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I appear to have mislaid (or Yahoo have inactivated) my
Yahoo! credentials for my world famous Flickr stream so let&#8217;s try some
inline thumbnails. Apologies for the quality.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/user/files/2007/03/yahoomail.JPG" title="Yahoo! Adware! Mail!"><img src="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/user/files/2007/03/yahoomail.thumbnail.JPG" alt="Yahoo! Adware!
Mail!" /></a></p>

<p>Note the MASSIVE banner ad on RHS (no I didn&#8217;t photoshop the red border)
and the more subtle ads bottom left.</p>

<p>I continue to use my ISP email account for personal stuff but am
starting a gradual migration to Gmail which started around a year ago.
Apart from spam, I hardly ever delete a Google email. Consequently, I am
barely scratching the surface of my 3GB allocation (35 MB - 1% - of the
allocated 2833 MB).</p>

<p>I also like the security of having messages and email address stored on
a server (and not my PC).</p>

<p>The ads on Google Mail seem much less noticeable and intrusive to me
(yeah I know I&#8217;m a Google
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/02/19/am-i-a-google-whore-yet/">whore</a>).
I can honestly say that I barely notice them. I think this is because of
the text (not banner) ads coupled with the white background although I
am not sure what advertising men in new media glasses would make of
this.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/user/files/2007/03/googlemail.JPG" title="Google Mail"><img src="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/user/files/2007/03/googlemail.thumbnail.JPG" alt="Google

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Many years ago, I managed a set of Oracle databases for various clients.</p>

<p>However, I was not an Oracle DBA. I was an Unix/C developer who happened
to progress to Pro*C, PL/SQL and some ETL projects for data warehouses.</p>

<p>I was an mediocre development DBA because I was a mediocre developer and
I had a keen interest in performance tuning i.e. I was (am remain) a
&#8216;glory hunter&#8217;.</p>

<p>I was not a production DBA because I didn&#8217;t have the training,
experience and discipline required for change controls and saying &#8216;No&#8217;.</p>

<p>One day, the CEO of our 18 man Internet startup asked me to deliver a
short presentation to the rest of the company what my team (me and my
junior) did all day.</p>

<p>I put up a slide that said:</p>

<ul>
<li>Data Availability</li>
</ul>


<p>I think a clever new media colleague helped me to add &#8216;transitions&#8217; to
add two more bullets.
-   Data Availability
-   Data Availability</p>

<p>Ironically, this wasn&#8217;t what we did which was covered on the next 34
slides. We did absolutely everything: fixing code, reloading data,
backups, analysis, ETL, extracts, PL/SQL, performance tuning, long
hours, recovery, testing, code reviews, cloning, documentation, nervous
breakdowns, monitoring, upgrades, configuration management, severed
relationships, recruitment, management and coffee.</p>

<p>However, data availability is precisely the only thing we should have
been doing.</p>

<p>Data availability is the sole responsibility of an Oracle production
DBA.</p>

<p>It is to ensure that data is available at all times to all users.</p>

<p>It is not to tune queries from 37 seconds to sub-second.</p>

<p>It is not to experiment with parallel query and parallel DML to tune a
third party application.</p>

<p>It is not to ensure that you can clone &#8216;ALL_OBJECTS&#8217; in less than 17
seconds.</p>

<p>It is not to ensure you can load 184 million records in 72 hours.</p>

<p>It is to ensure that you can restore data from a catastrophic failure.</p>

<p>It is to ensure you can restore service following an expected failure.</p>

<p>It is to ensure you can restore from the backups deposited in secure
off-site storage.</p>

<p>It is to ensure that the file system holding the archive logs never
fills up.</p>

<p>It is to ensure that you can have a coherent plan to restore service
after any unexpected event.</p>

<p>It is to ensure that you take responsibility and say &#8216;Yes. That is down
to me&#8217;.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Inevitably, my new best friend, Michael, the Virgin Media engineer
didn&#8217;t return on Friday afternoon to complete the
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/03/23/virgin-media-v-upgrade/">installation</a>
of V+ or to reinstate my original, functional set top box to provide me
with a TV service over the weekend.</p>

<p>Instead, he hurriedly telephoned me to say he had transferred this issue
to the &#8216;networks team&#8217; who would call me later to resolve it. Surprise,
surprise, the &#8216;networks team&#8217; didn&#8217;t call me to resolve it so I had to
call them (on three separate occasions) to make another appointment.</p>

<p>I was trying to do the engineer a favour by suggesting he went off to
his other jobs on Friday. I trusted him. With hindsight, I was probably
naive, gullible and stupid.</p>

<p>A word of warning to the engineer who is scheduled to appear on Tuesday
afternoon. My wife is taking time off work to accommodate your visit
which she is already unhappy about. My wife doesn&#8217;t know (or care) what
V+ is.</p>

<p>She is also &#8216;bitterly disappointed&#8217; (she actually used different words)
that Virgin Media can only specify an four hour window for an afternoon
visit. As she works locally, she would have preferred the engineer to
call her directly with an hours notice.</p>

<p>My wife is not naive, gullible or stupid so don&#8217;t be surprised if you
don&#8217;t get offered a cup of coffee. There is a possibility that she will
not offer you a visitors parking permit for your van which consequently
may get clamped.</p>

<p>If there are any further problems this time, don&#8217;t just stand staring at
a diagnostics screen saying &#8216;I think the Hit will download in a few
minutes&#8217; or swap one brand new functional box for another brand new
functional box, do something to try to fix it.</p>

<p>Otherwise, there is a danger that you will be locked up in chains,
thrown into the depths of the cellar and fed on a diet of crackers and
water until the V+ service is actually working.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This afternoon, a Virgin Media engineer has arrived to
&#8217;<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/03/09/free-upgrades-from-virgin-media/">upgrade</a>
&#8217; my existing set top box to a V+ (TV drive).</p>

<p>This is a straightforward box swap. No additional wiring or drilling is
required. However, the new box failed to initialise. We both stared
expectantly at the following screen for an eternity:</p>

<blockquote><p>Card Status: No T-Stream</p>

<p>IPPV Status: BLANK</p></blockquote>

<p>He then called technical services who initiated the operation. He double
checked the serial numbers of the V+ box and the card. He tried to
bamboozle me with science &#8216;Hits must be slow today&#8217;.</p>

<p>Eventually, he gave up and fetched a second V+ box from his van. I
reciprocated with a visitor&#8217;s parking permit. It now looks unlikely that
this simple box upgrade will be finished within the original 5 minute
period.</p>

<p>We made more polite smalltalk like a couple on their first date. We
waited. And waited. The &#8216;IPPV Status&#8217; stubbornly remained &#8216;BLANK&#8217;. He
showed me the User Guide - a booklet cunningly disguised in a DVD box.</p>

<p>We waited a little longer. We both pretended to admire the new black V+
remote control.</p>

<p>Suddenly, he exclaimed &#8216;At last !&#8217;. He seemed very pleased the see the
&#8216;Credit Limit&#8217; field change to &pound;105.00. &#8216;Oh good - it&#8217;s finally starting
to come through. Shouldn&#8217;t be much longer now.&#8217;</p>

<p>But it was. We waited. I offered him a cup of tea (&#8216;Ta. Milk, two
sugars&#8217;).</p>

<p>He called the service centre yet again to quadruple check the serial
numbers had been entered correctly. He seemed a little frustrated and
annoyed to discover the numbers were not &#8216;paired off&#8217; (mismatch between
STB and SmartCard) correctly.</p>

<p>This news seemed to disappoint him as he said quite forcefully &#8216;I have
been waiting around for 45 minutes for this TV Drive reset&#8217;. However, he
now seemed supremely confident that this time, the box would be
initialised properly in the next 5 minutes.</p>

<p>It wasn&#8217;t. We talked. I showed him my holiday photos from Norway. We
finished our tea. My wife asked if he &#8216;would be stopping for tea.&#8217;</p>

<p>Eventually, I suggested that he went off to his other three jobs and
return later this afternoon. He politely rejected this suggestion,
saying &#8216;No let&#8217;s just give it another 5 minutes.&#8217;</p>

<p>15 minutes later, he gave up and went off to his remaining jobs,
promising to call me later to confirm that the V+ box is finally ready.</p>

<p>However, another 45 minutes has passed and the &#8216;Card Status&#8217; is still
&#8216;No T-Stream&#8217; so I have a feeling he will be returning but only to
reinstate my original set top box.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Generally, the quality of cover versions on YouTube can
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjyr6P1agWo&amp;mode=related&amp;search=">vary</a>
to say the <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=QAMyQdBWhUw">least</a>.</p>

<p>However, covers that purely mime to the original soundtrack are
excellent as you can simply minimise the video and listen to decent
music, you were forced to remove to make way for another yet another
virtual machine.</p>

<p>This

version of

by Nirvana has a certain visual appeal though - the drums and cymbal,
the bendy guitar and the socks.</p>
