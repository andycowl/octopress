  <div class="entry-content"><p>Occasionally, I used to wonder what people thought when they were
subjected to some of the material on this blog. <a href="http://andrewsherman.blogspot.com/">Andrew
Sherman</a>&#8217;s
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/01/14/two-one-way-tickets-to-dublin-please/#comment-30737">comment</a>
questioning whether this
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/01/14/two-one-way-tickets-to-dublin-please/">story</a>
was completely true also resurrected this thought.</p>

<p>Most of the articles, posts, stories on this blog are based on truth.
The vast majority are anecdotes recounting real-life events that
actually happened to me, that my warped sense of humour finds amusing.
Examples in this category:</p>

<ul>

<p>Other posts are simultaneously technical and non-technical but merely an
opportunity for a superb, ambiguous title.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/09/13/packet-sniffer/">Packet

<p>Another category of posts are almost completely true but embellished, to
a greater or lesser degree for comic effect, normally for the
punchline/conclusion:</p>

<p>Sometimes I massage thoughts and ideas that would be too boring for a
conventional blog entry. Imagine the tedium of a blog entry that reads
&#8216;I really enjoy the BBC series: <a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/09/16/dragons-den/">Dragon&#8217;s
Den</a> - do you
?&#8217;</p>

<p>A relatively small number are (obviously) complete, drug and drink
induced, fiction. Normally characterised by silly names.</p>

<p>Single, weak attempt at satire. I always wanted to write for Private
Eye.</p>

</ul>


<p>The biggest compliment anyone has ever paid me was when <a href="http://oracledoug.com/serendipity">Doug
Burns</a> commented &#8216;You refuse to
sign-post things&#8217;. In fact, this was merely an observation on my
blogging style but I took it as a compliment. In fact, I was so struck
by this that I immediately put up a sign-post with this very quote above
my desk.</p>

<p>You don&#8217;t need smiley faces dotted everywhere telling you where to smile
or laugh inwardly.</p>

<p>You don&#8217;t need to understand all of the lyrics.</p>

<p>You need to be left thinking &#8216;What on earth was that all about ?&#8217;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Great news. Bill Gates has heeded my
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2005/11/09/e-commerce-at-microsoft-uk/">advice</a>
and I will be able to purchase Vista online
and<a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070118/ap_on_hi_te/microsoft_vista">download</a>
the media. This means that I no longer have to buy an expensive box full
of fresh air from Microsoft.</p>

<p>Burning a DVD is probably still recommended just in case the seamless
Windows upgrade fails and I discover, to my horror, that none of my
drivers work any more and I have to format the hard disk in order to
boot the computer.</p>

<p>However, I take a similar attitude to risk averse Siebel customers
contemplating the recently released 8.0. I have a large and demanding
customer base (son and daughter) and an integrator who wastes all my
hard-earned money (wife) with a perceived requirement for 7x24 operation
and high availability.</p>

<p>On reflection, it&#8217;s probably better to let other <del>idiots</del> people
suffer the pain and iron all the glitches out before I take the plunge
when SP1 is released.</p>

<p>That reminds me; I really must ring my Dad tonight and warn him not to
do anything stupid.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am not overly surprised the Al Qaeda training camp in Afghanistan
educates people about how to assemble explosive devices and avoid
detection by security forces in addition to tips on identifying soft
targets. The hands-on lab exercises (days 4-5) will undoubtedly assist
with providing riveting content for suicide notes and how to get the
soft lighting right for your exit video.</p>

<p>All of this hard work will be ultimately worthwhile because there is the
promise of eternal martyrdom and 99 vestal virgins dressed in white
lingerie. The highly prestigious Terrorist Certificated Professional
(TCP) qualification will also be presented to all successful candidates
on completion of the course.</p>

<p>However, I am a little surprised the terrorist training course also
includes &#8216;How to negotiate a discount for bulk purchases of <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-2555956.html">hydrogen
peroxide</a>.&#8217;</p>

<p>Turning your back, as you prepare to meet your maker and detonate your
device, to face a mother with a baby in a push-chair is pretty mean
hearted too.</p>

<p>In most civilised countries, a mob would have pursued and savagely
attacked the fleeing bombers. In London, a middle-aged lady said &#8216;Excuse
me. You appear to have dropped something out of your rucksack&#8217; and held
up a 6 inch nail and ball bearing.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Siebel 8.0 is the first major release since the Oracle takeover and is
now imminent.</p>

<p>Oracle are planning a simultaneous
<a href="http://www.oracle.com/webapps/events/EventsDetail.jsp?p_eventId=59792&amp;src=4938562&amp;src=4938562&amp;Act=11">launch</a>
of five different products (JD Edwards, E-Business, PeopleSoft and
Siebel 8.0) on 31 January 2007.</p>

<p>Ed Abbo (VP CRM products) will be chairing the Siebel session and
<a href="http://searchcrm.techtarget.com/">SearchCRM</a> has an interesting (albeit
low quality) <del>interview</del>
<a href="http://searchcrm.techtarget.com/originalContent/0,289142,sid11_gci1233500,00.html">podcast</a>
with Ed where he talks about new features in Siebel 8.0, CRM OnDemand
and the impact of the Oracle takeover on Siebel&#8217;s development and
strategy.</p>

<p>The Oracle Applications Users Group (<a href="http://www.oaug.org/">OAUG</a>) also
has an excellent
<a href="http://www.oaug.org/usercommunities/siebel/documents/siebel8overview.pdf">summary</a>
of the new functionality in Siebel 8.0.</p>

<p>IBM has published a useful
<a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/support/techdocs/atsmastr.nsf/WebIndex/TD103401">whitepaper</a>
about tuning Siebel 8.0 on AIX 5.3. The paper includes benchmarks with
different virtual memory page sizes and shows the benefits of
simultaneous multi-threading. The paper also includes analysis of
generic tuning features available in Siebel (connection pooling and
threads per process).</p>

<p>The two key features that specifically interest me are the Siebel
Diagnostic Console and the introduction of support for Linux (RedHat
4.0, SuSE 9.0).</p>

<p>The Siebel Diagnostic Console offers an Analytics style dashboard
interface into the volumes of data produced by SARM.</p>

<p>Secondly, the number of Siebel customers choosing to deploy on Linux in
the coming months will be interesting.</p>

<p>Another example of the closer integration between Siebel and Oracle is
the recent announcement of a management pack for Oracle Enterprise
Manager (OEM) in the recently released 10.2.0.3.</p>

<blockquote><p>Oracle Application Management Pack for Siebel is a comprehensive
solution for managing the configuration, performance, availability,
and service level of Siebel CRM applications. It can be used to
monitor the health of the servers and components, measure application
response time, track configuration changes, and diagnose performance
and execution problems.</p></blockquote>

<p>This will be an invaluable tool for Oracle DBA&#8217;s (who may be unfamiliar
with the Siebel application) to easily monitor a Siebel OLTP instance
and identify performance problems more promptly.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Earlier this week, I flew to my favourite city - Dublin.</p>

<p>Book the tickets online as normal. Check-in at the Aer Lingus
self-service kiosk to get my boarding pass as normal.</p>

<p>My credit card isn&#8217;t recognised. No problem. Just use my passport
instead. My passport isn&#8217;t recognised. No problem. Just enter my name
instead. My name isn&#8217;t recognised. No problem. Enter my booking
reference number. This isn&#8217;t recognised either. As this is the first
time I have flown on Aer Lingus, I give up and queue up at the desk.</p>

<p>There is no problem. I am quickly booked on the flight and the pretty
lady checks my bag and hands me my boarding pass. As I turn away, she
asks &#8216;Do you did book a ticket for a colleague ?&#8217;. &#8216;Err, no&#8217; &#8216;Oh - you
appear to have made two identical bookings&#8217;. She suggests that I
clarify the situation at the ticket sales desk.</p>

<p>Sure enough. For some reason, I have two identical return flights
booked so I cancel one. However, the tickets are non-refundable so I
am told to contact the travel agent who made the original booking.</p>

<p>So I call the corporate travel agent. I waste 15 minutes explaining
the problem. The customer agent doesn&#8217;t understand why I booked two
tickets when I only wanted one. I explain it is an
human/computer/administrative error. I explain that I received a
single confirmation email. Then she doesn&#8217;t understand why I need a
refund issued. Then she doesn&#8217;t understand why the airline can&#8217;t issue
a refund.</p>

<p>I explain that is absolutely imperative the customer is not billed as
a result of this error. It is even more imperative that I, personally,
do not lose the sum of &pound;221. Finally, we understand each other
and she agrees to talk to Aer Lingus to see whether a refund can be
issued.  Panic over. I board the short flight to Ireland with only a
slight feeling of unease and a mental note to investigate this more
fully on my return.</p>

<p>The following evening, I am returning to London. My credit card isn&#8217;t
recognised at the Aer Lingus kiosk. No problem. Type in my newly
issued, confirmed, 100% correct booking reference. This isn&#8217;t
recognised either.  Sigh. People behind me in the queue aren&#8217;t
moaning. They are smiling, chatting and laughing while they
wait. Because they are Irish.</p>

<p>I queue up at the check-in desk. Lots of frantic typing. Puzzled
expression. More frantic typing. The lady must be dying to look up and
say &#8216;Computer says No&#8217; but resists. &#8216;Sorry I can find your name and
booking but I can&#8217;t allocate you a seat. Sorry but you&#8217;ll have to go
over to ticket sales.&#8217;</p>

<p>I duly trudge over to the queue at ticket sales. Finally I reach the
head of the queue. A helpful Irish gentleman hears my story. He types
frantically and looks puzzled. He says &#8216;Would you excuse me a minute
while I just ask the supervisor a question ?&#8217;</p>

<p>I wait patiently for the outcome but I don&#8217;t need to. I know exactly
what he is going to say.</p>

<p>&#8216;Sorry for the delay Sir. There seems to have been some mix-up. For
some reason, your travel agent has cancelled your return flight.&#8217;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I also enjoyed last night&#8217;s &#8217;<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/proginfo/tv/wk2/unplaced.shtml#unplaced_mortgage">Did they pay off their mortgage in two
years
?</a>&#8217;
about a likable creative artist from Cornwall who makes interesting,
arty (and high margin) stoves from VW car parts aimed at rich people
in South Kensington.</p>

<p>The last minute of the
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/01/20/recursive-financial-advice-from-the-bbc/">show</a>
was a real emotional roller coaster.</p>

<p>Firstly, I was delighted to hear the couple&#8217;s hard work had showed an
unbelievable return of &pound;104,000 profit but then shattered to
hear they had fallen a paltry &pound;1,500 of being able to pay off
their mortgage in full.</p>

<p>My hopes rose again as &#8216;international businessman and motivational
speaker, Rene Carayol&#8217; spontaneously (and very conveniently) purchased
a stove and handed them the &pound;1,500 in cash.</p>

<p>Then I started to laugh uncontrollably as I struggled to assimilate
Rene&#8217;s closing words</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;Congratulations. You have done it. You have paid your mortgage off.
Now there&#8217;s just one more small thing to do. Review the books and
see > how much you owe the tax man.&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>So, although they paid their mortgage off, the couple are now saddled
with a sizable personal loan to clear their debts to the Inland
Revenue.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was fascinated by the &#8217;<a href="http://www.open2.net/nhs/">Can Gerry Robinson fix the
NHS</a>&#8217; series broadcast on BBC2 this week.</p>

<p>Not because I learned a lot about how the NHS works. Not because I was
staggered at the simplicity of Robinson&#8217;s approach. Not because I was
surprised that Robinson managed to implement various changes to
significantly reduce waiting lists at a Rotherham hospital in just 6
months.</p>

<p>I was fascinated because I have encountered so many of those issues,
heard so many of those quotes verbatim and met so many of those
stereotypes during 20 years in IT.</p>

<ul>
<li>The people who meet any sensible suggestion for improvement with an
array of negative reasons why that simply won&#8217;t be possible.</li>
<li>The people who estimate that implementing a simple change will take
months to implement.</li>
<li>The retort of &#8216;That will need another meeting to be set up.&#8217;</li>
<li>The senior management who haven&#8217;t got a clue about the real issues
faced by people working on the shop floor.</li>
<li>The people actually using the system know what the real issues are.</li>
<li>The lengthy, directionless meetings which agree to &#8216;do something&#8217;
but don&#8217;t assign ownership or commit to a date.</li>
<li>The expensive use of &#8216;management consultants&#8217; to tell senior
management what they already know.</li>
<li>Cost cutting in the very areas that need extra resources.</li>
</ul>


<p>The ultimate irony is that having implemented the changes, re-motivated
the staff and significantly reduced the waiting lists, every single
poorly person in Yorkshire will now forcefully insist that their GP
immediately refers them to Rotherham General Hospital.
Consequently, the waiting lists will rocket, Brian James will lose his
job, the consultants will revert to their old ways and the job freeze
will be reinstated.</p>

<p>However, Gerry Robinson and the BBC will be invited back to film a
second series.</p>
