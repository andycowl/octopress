  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was rather hoping <a href="http://disqus.com">Disqus</a> would be a 100% plug-in
replacement for the woefully inadequate
<a href="http://cocomment.com/">coComment</a> so I could simply track all the
comments I leave on assorted blogs and easily monitor other comment
threads of interest.</p>

<p>An RSS feed of such comment activity would be an ideal element to feed
into the Tumble dryer.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.disqus.com/">Disqus</a> launched yesterday and as it was
written in
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/09/26/last-django-in-london/">Django</a>,
looks OK and isn&#8217;t too invasive or distracting (c.f
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/09/17/a-rush-of-blood/">BlogRush</a>),
I have enabled the WordPress plugin on this blog.</p>

<p>Comments can now be threaded (just like
<a href="http://www.s9y.org/">serendipity</a>) and (thankfully) you don&#8217;t need to
register with Disqus to leave a comment.</p>

<p>Comments can be rated and the comments are hosted on Disqus forums.</p>

<p>Paul Stamatiou wrote a excellent
<a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/2007/10/30/disqus-officially-launches/">review</a>
about the features in Disqus and Techcrunch
also<a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/10/30/disqus-joins-the-battle-for-your-blogs-comments/">reviewed</a>
the software.</p>

<p>I have some minor concerns:</p>

<ul>
<li>I currently use <a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/07/10/out-with-the-old-in-with-the-new/">Spam
Karma</a>
to handle comment spam on this blog. SK2 is unbelievably efficient
and far superior than Akismet. I can count on the fingers of one
hand, the number of comments and trackback spam that got past SK2 so
I have some concerns about reverting to an inferior spam filtering
solution.</li>
<li>Until every blog in the world integrates Disqus, I still won&#8217;t be
able to track all of my comments. Still, I am still waiting for the
world to universally adopt
<a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki">Emacs</a> and
<a href="http://barry.warsaw.us/elisp/">Supercite</a> so email works properly
so I guess I can live with that.</li>
<li>Although you are supposed to be able to quickly and easily import
Disqus comments back into WordPress, I need to check how this is
implemented.</li>
<li>It is not clear whether Disqus will currently work on hosted
WordPress.</li>
</ul>


<p>Obviously, the &#8216;Recent Comments&#8217; widget is now defunct so I replaced
that with a RSS widget for the new Disqus Comments RSS feed.
I&#8217;ll try Disqus out for a while as an experiment but I guess the most
important and valuable feedback will be from readers of this blog.
Without you, I am nothing, a lone voice in the darkness, a blog in
isolation.</p>

<p>So if you have any thoughts, just leave a comment.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>On May 21 2007, this newspaper published an
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/05/21/the-tragic-case-of-madeleine-mccann/">article</a>
that was somehow misconstrued by some idiotic readers to imply that the
funds raised to assist with the search for the missing girl, Madeleine
McCann, were being misused by Gerry and Kate McCann to fund baby sitting
services and countless bottles of Rioja (Gran Reserve 1987 vintage) for
British holidaymakers (aka Tapas Bar 7) in sunny Portugal.</p>

<p>In the light of several hundred complaints from outraged readers and the
threat of legal action from the McCann&#8217;s Press Office (which is
absolutely not funded from the Find Madeleine fund whatsoever), this
newspaper is pleased to offer a full and unequivocal apology to Gerry
and Kate McCann on today&#8217;s front page.</p>

<p>After clarifying the original story with the unnamed sources, this
esteemed organ will now restate the facts of the matter once and for
all.</p>

<p>Not one penny of the funds raised (currently standing at over 1 million
pounds) have been misused in any way, shape or form by the McCanns.</p>

<p>We know this for a fact because the money in question has, in fact, been
used to make mortgage
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7068760.stm">payments</a> on the McCann&#8217;s 5
bedroom detached property in Leicester, near Rothley.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Sadly, the world&#8217;s first and most prolific blogger, the Reverend Robert
Shields has passed away in America aged 89. Shields was the author of
the world&#8217;s <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article2767270.ece">longest
diary</a>
consisting of a staggering 37 million words.</p>

<p>Shields was truly the world&#8217;s first blogger with his first recorded
entry in April 1927 beating Dave <a href="http://www.scripting.com/">Winer</a> by 3
months. Nor was Robert Shields afraid of including trivia and useless
information in his journals. For example, how many blogs (or
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/10/25/rowche-rumble/">Tumblelogs</a>
for that matter) record blood pressure readings (Shields despised silly
mood emoticons), make any effort to fastidiously record every single
visit to the lavatory (Shields had dozens of imaginative ways to
describe the act of urination) or have the thoughtfulness to detail
every single piece of junk mail ever received.</p>

<p>Lazy, modern bloggers (with the possible exception of Robert
<a href="http://scobleizer.com/">Scoble</a> who, coincidentally, was named after
Shields) everywhere should hang their heads in shame when they learn of
Shield&#8217;s commitment to the blogging cause; Shields never slept for more
than 2 hours to ensure he could capture his dreams.</p>

<p>Here is just one example of his exceptional writing:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;9.35-9.40 I cleaned the cerumen from both my ears and from both
hearing aids.&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>Unfortunately, although Shields has left the 91 boxes containing his
life&#8217;s work to a university, he has stipulated that the full contents
can not be published until 2049.
I will leave the final words to the great man himself.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;It is an uninhibited diary, It is spontaneous. I type it as it comes,
I don&#8217;t correct it and I don&#8217;t edit it.&#8217;</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am bored of tormenting myself, conjuring up full blown blog posts,
pouring over non-existent Adsense revenues and analyzing traffic
statistics so I have started a <a href="http://andyc.tumblr.com/">Tumblelog</a>.</p>

<p>There is something very appealing about Kottke&#8217;s
<a href="http://www.kottke.org/05/10/tumblelogs">definition</a> of a Tumblelog as
&#8216;a quick and dirty stream of consciousness.&#8217;</p>

<p>A Tumblelog can be a short, snappy blog and can also aggregate different
RSS feeds (Google Shared Stuff and Items, del.icio.us, last.fm, Flickr
and even this blog). Why, <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a> even has
built-in support for quotes.</p>

<p>However, undoubtedly the best feature is the endless scope for puns in
the non rotating taglines:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Fall/_/Rowche+Rumble">Rowche Tumble</a></li>
<li>Are you ready to Tumble ?</li>
<li>Tumble Dryer</li>
<li>Tumble in the jungle</li>
<li>A bit of rough and Tumble</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t mumble, Tumble !</li>
</ul>


<p>I have already contacted <a href="http://davidville.com/">Davidville</a> to enquire
about any openings in sales and marketing.</p>

<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/07/06/just-do-what-you-are-told-2/">series</a>.</p>

<p>&#8216;Hello John. Can I ask you a quick question ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Well I&#8217;m onsite at a Red account in deepest Kazbakistan about to go
into a crisis meeting. But, as it&#8217;s you (again). Go on. Fire away.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Well I have a really strange problem. I&#8217;m currently at Asda and I can&#8217;t
get&#8230;&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yeah. Hurry up. What&#8217;s the actual problem ? Installation, performance,
database, network, security, clustering, defect, LDAP - what is it ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Well it&#8217;s an unusual one. It&#8217;s the milk.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;The milk. What on earth are you talking about ? Did you really say milk
?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Well, as I said, I&#8217;m currently in Asda and there is no milk.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;For Christ&#8217;s sake, you&#8217;re calling to ask me a question about your
grocery shopping.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yeah. I really need milk and there isn&#8217;t any.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Well obviously all the milk is sold out. Get fully skimmed or get 2
pints from the newsagent or the Total garage.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;But the milk isn&#8217;t actually sold out. That&#8217;s the weird thing.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Well if it isn&#8217;t sold out, why is there no milk there ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;That&#8217;s why I am calling you. Although there&#8217;s no milk, there is a sign
on the refrigerator where the milk should be and the sign mentions you.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Mentions me. What do you mean - the sign mentions me ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Shut up and listen&#8217;</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;Due to circumstances beyond our control, the milk chiller is
currently out of service. We hope to have the unit working again as
soon as poss-&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>&#8216;Look - can you hurry up ? The council of war is starting&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Well just shut up and listen then.&#8217;</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;We hope to have the unit working again as soon as possible. We
sincerely apologise to all our loyal customers for the inconvenience
caused. Until then, may we suggest you ask a colleague for advice.&#8217;</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When your children ask for a pet hamster, always follow your gut
instincts and refuse.</p>

<p>Last night, I entered the bathroom to find my wife had suddenly and
unexpectedly replaced the tile lino with bare floorboards. She was on
her knees sanding the boards for that perfect Victorian antique looking
finish.</p>

<p>I carefully navigated my way to the sink and noticed my two children
huddled under the pedestal, feverishly yanking at floorboards and
ripping up plywood with their bare hands.</p>

<p>&#8216;Stop it. What do you think you&#8217;re doing ? For the last time, it&#8217;s
bedtime. I&#8217;m trying to brush my teeth here.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Dad - it&#8217;s Gromit. He&#8217;s trapped under the floorboards.&#8217;</p>

<p>My wife politely interjected&#8230;</p>

<p>&#8216;Put that bloody toothbrush down and get me a claw hammer. Now.&#8217;</p>

<p>And so it continued. The stylish, ivory and cream, fake Italian lino got
torn, pieces of plywood got raised and more floorboards got levered up.
Still, there was no access to the little, cuddly, brown hamster who was
squealing from under the sink pedestal. I could have sworn he was
singing &#8216;A song from under the floorboards&#8217; by Magazine.</p>

<p>I resigned myself to his imminent death and yet another pet funeral in
my garden. I tried to sneak out without brushing my teeth, claiming I
was looking for creative solutions on the Internet. I slipped and broke
my ankle on pine nuts that were liberally scattered on the floor.</p>

<p>&#8216;Get me a pair of pliers. Now.&#8217;</p>

<p>Oh no. Not the torture by pliers. My wife proferred a coat hanger which
I severed in two places. She then bent the wire into an improvised
corkscrew style, helter-skelter type device for small rodents.</p>

<p>Thankfully, with more coaxing, the hamster managed to achieve yet
another miraculous
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/03/21/a-narrow-escape/">escape</a>.
This was a tremendous relief as I suspect my wife&#8217;s next strategy was to
start drilling up through the lounge ceiling perilously close to
multiple water pipes.</p>

<p>Later in bed, I remarked &#8216;When those hamsters are dead, we are not
getting any more pets. Ever.&#8217;</p>

<p>Norma replied &#8216;Oh come on. Could you really stand there every morning
and night brushing your teeth knowing that Gromit&#8217;s dead body lay just
four feet away under the floorboards ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;You know what Norma. You&#8217;re right. He&#8217;s such a lovable little hamster I
don&#8217;t think I could have possibly lived with myself.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;There you are. So you do have a heart after all. You do care.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I suppose I would have ended up using the downstairs loo instead.&#8217;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>An inquest has reached an open verdict on the death of a judge, six
years ago.</p>

<p>This <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/somerset/7041059.stm">story</a>
caught the media interest in the UK because</p>

<ol>
<li>The victim was a judge hence plenty of scope for pictures of him
wearing his robes and his silly wig.</li>
<li>The victim was having an affair with a glamorous mistress.</li>
<li>The storyline was identical to an episode of &#8216;Midsomer Murders&#8217;
aired in March 2003.</li>
<li>The wife was arrested but later released without charge.</li>
<li>The mistress was also under suspicion for blackmail.</li>
</ol>


<p>However, what I found interesting (it&#8217;s not really appropriate to say
hilarious) about this case was the sequence of events after the judge
told his wife of the affair and the fact he wanted a divorce. After
dropping this bombshell to his wife of 34 years, he then went upstairs
to, wait for it, change into his gardening clothes and prepared to mow
the lawn.
The man went to the garden shed to mount his expensive, deluxe ride-on
lawn-mower, when a stray spark ignited petrol fumes causing a massive
explosion.</p>

<p>The distraught wife, in a very British way, ran outside and, horrified
at the blazing inferno <del>dialled 999 in an attempt to save the life of
her unfaithful husband</del> hurriedly gathered in her washing.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There is currently no utility to migrate existing blog content to
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/09/26/last-django-in-london/">django</a>.</p>

<p>However, conversion of an existing WordPress blog is pretty
straightforward.</p>

<p>Firstly, simply export the following tables from the WordPress database
using phpMyAdmin</p>

<ul>
<li>wp_posts</li>
<li>wp_comments</li>
<li>wp_terms</li>
<li>wp_term_taxonomy</li>
<li>wp_term_relationships</li>
</ul>


<p>Import the tables into the django database.
Then run the following SQL statements which migrate posts, comments and
categories and assume a WordPress 2.3 schema and a blank django blog. If
you have already created <a href="http://blog.nbrightside.com/blog/">content</a> in
django, minor changes will be needed. My WordPress blog only uses
categories which simply get converted to django tags.</p>

<pre><code>insert into blog_post
(id,
slug,
title,
pubdate,
moddate,
body,
draft,
closed)
select
wp_posts.id,
wp_posts.post_name,
wp_posts.post_title,
wp_posts.post_date_gmt,
wp_posts.post_modified_gmt,
wp_posts.post_content,
0,
0
from wp_posts
and post_type = 'post';

insert into comments_freecomment
(id,
content_type_id,
comment,
object_id,
person_name,
submit_date,
is_public,
ip_address,
approved,
site_id)
select
wp_comments.comment_id,
14,
wp_comments.comment_content,
wp_comments.comment_post_id,
wp_comments.comment_author,
wp_comments.comment_date_gmt,
1,
wp_comments.comment_author_ip,
wp_comments.comment_approved,
1
from wp_comments
where comment_approved = '1';

insert into blog_tag
(slug,
title,
description)
select
wp_terms.slug,
wp_terms.name,
wp_terms.name
from wp_terms;

insert into blog_post_tags
(post_id,
tag_id)
select
wp_term_relationships.object_id,
wp_terms.name
from wp_term_relationships, wp_term_taxonomy, wp_terms
where wp_term_relationships.term_taxonomy_id = wp_term_taxonomy.term_taxonomy_id
and wp_term_taxonomy.term_id = wp_terms.term_id;
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, delete the WP_* tables from the django (and not the
WordPress) database.</p>
