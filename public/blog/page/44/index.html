  <div class="entry-content"><p>As part of my job, I often have the pleasure of walking around call
centers where agents use headsets to enable them to interact with a
computer while conducting a telephone call with a customer.</p>

<p>I have often wondered whether it would be cool or nerdy to use such a
headset myself. To date, where possible, I tend to use my mobile phone
on speakerphone so I am free to continue to type. For lengthy conference
calls (abroad), this isn&#8217;t a particularly cost-effective option but
please don&#8217;t tell the CFO.</p>

<p>With the increasing adoption of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voip">VOIP</a> within Oracle and the recent
delivery of my deluxe
<a href="http://www1.gnnetcom.com/usa2003/contactCenter/2100SoundTube.html">headset</a>,
I am typing this while listening to a team meeting using Cisco
<a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/sw/voicesw/ps5475/products_data_sheet09186a00801f8e48.html">Communicator</a>.
This is really neat technology, the sound quality surprisingly good and
even better, the telephone call is free, completely free. So please tell
the CFO.</p>

<p>As for cool or nerdy, let&#8217;s just say I will only be doing this from the
privacy of my own home or possibly my office.</p>

<p>My kids think my adoption of this technology is absolutely hilarious.
They keep smirking whenever they come into the kitchen for a snack and
if I happen to be actually speaking on the device, they simply can&#8217;t
contain their hysterics and have to leave the room.</p>

<p>In addition, my wife keeps smiling and repeatedly asking me whether she
can get a motor insurance

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Despite a scattering of snow in London that normally brings the country
to a complete halt, my return flight from Copenhagen was on time and
blissfully uneventful.</p>

<p>Unusually, I was hoping for lengthy queues at passport control in T3. I
was praying for four flights to land simultaneously and for the
resulting queues to snake around the corner and past the toilets.</p>

<p>Why ? Because today it is finally going to happen. After, inexplicably
not flying abroad for 6 months, I had finally managed to arrange my
rendezvous with
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/10/03/stood-up-by-iris/">Iris</a>.
Tonight was the our first date.</p>

<p>I was a little nervous as I separated from the crowds and waltzed up to
approach the Iris barrier. The lady in front of me was already having
problems. She was staring blankly into a blank screen. The camera
appeared to be off and certainly wasn&#8217;t scanning her face (or anything
else).</p>

<p>An immigration official came over to help: &#8216;Use the lower camera&#8217;. The
lady dipped her head and stared into the middle screen. Still nothing.
How embarassing. Is it too late to rejoin the queue for passsport
control ? The assistant said &#8216;No. No. Look into the bottom screen.&#8217;</p>

<p>This meant the lady virtually had to squat on her knees and look into a
screen positioned three feet from the ground. Finally, the advanced
computer system recognised her credentials (and simultaneously sent her
personal details to the FBI and Mossad). Rather flustered, she got up
from the carpet and proceeded through the exit barrier exclaiming &#8216;Well
I don&#8217;t think much of that system.&#8217;</p>

<p>Actually, the lady had made a schoolboy error that was covered on day 2
of the Iris Certified Professional (ICP) Training course. Advanced
sensors on the entry barriers electronically scan to determine the
height of the incoming body mass. If you enter, swinging your bag first,
then the sensors mistakenly think you are a toddler or a dwarf.</p>

<p>Nervously, I entered the zone with my bag behind me. Iris was great fun.
You look into a screen with your own image and have to precisely align
your eyes with two green dots. This sounds easy but isn&#8217;t. The computer
helps you with &#8216;Move your head to the left&#8217;, &#8216;Move backwards&#8217; and &#8216;Look
- a fraction to the right. Now just stay still !&#8217; so the whole exercise
turns into a game of 3D &#8216;Golden Shot&#8217;.</p>

<p>When the system recognises your retinal scan, you are free to proceed,
waving at your colleagues waiting to clear immigration and guaranteed to
be the first person waiting 25 minutes at the baggage carousel. During
the trial period, you get presented with a &#8216;I came through IRIS in 17
seconds&#8217; or &#8216;IRIS thinks I am a dwarf&#8217; badge of honour.</p>

<p>I completed a feedback form with a couple of enhancement requests:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;Can the screen be upgraded to colour ?&#8217;
&#8216;Can the green dots be replaced with cross-hair rifle sights ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;How does Iris cope with bloodshot eyes ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Can a sound effect (gun shot, hurrah, round of applause) be sounded
on successful recognition ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Can the system flash red lights and sirens with &#8216;YOU ARE AN ILLEGAL
IMMIGRANT&#8217; if the individual takes more than 2 minutes ?&#8217;</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>[Well, my SEO professor said it was much better than &#8216;Sports Bars of
Europe #7&#8217;]</p>

<p>Feverishly scoured the Interweb looking for alternative sports bars in
Copenhagen. Once I saw the address of my previous
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/04/25/sports-bars-of-europe-2/">haunt</a>,
the marvellous &#8217;<a href="http://www.the-irish-rover.com/HTML/Home.htm">Irish
Rover</a>&#8217;, my mind was
instantly made up.</p>

<p>Tomorrow morning, when the customer politely asks me what I got up to
last night, instead of &#8216;Caught up with my email and ordered room
service&#8217;, I can now proffer &#8216;I spent a glorious, unforgettable night up
&#8216;Jorcks Passage&#8217;.</p>

<p>Inspired, I ran down the 19 flights of stairs down to the lobby to get a
city map which I strive to hold the
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/01/13/sports-bars-of-europe/">right</a>
way up. The pretty, blonde Danish receptionist couldn&#8217;t be more helpful.
She pointed to the <a href="http://www.admiralhotel.dk/Default.aspx?ID=2">hotel</a>
(D2) and passed me the map with a knowing smile; &#8216;I am hearing this
<a href="http://www.antique-toys.dk/">place</a> (G7) is <strong>very</strong> popular with the
English business men, if you are knowing what I am meaning&#8217;.</p>

<p>Even with the map the right way up, I still got lost. I passed a large
City square surrounded by an ice rink and then the street signs ran out.
Desperate, I opened the map and accosted a young lady in a lonely,
darkly lit street asking for directions to &#8216;The Stroget&#8217;. Instead of
running away, mugging me for my phone or accusing me of date rape, she
replied &#8216;Yes. I am going that way so you can follow if you like.&#8217;</p>

<p>We got chatting and it transpired she had a late night at work as she
was planning for Scandanavia&#8217;s largest fashion festival in 10 days.
Inevitably, as we hit &#8216;Stroget&#8217; and the designer shops, our pace slowed
to a crawl as we stopped to admire this year&#8217;s autumnal designs in a
very fetching
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/05/29/brown-is-the-new-black/">brown</a>.</p>

<p>This was going nowhere. I don&#8217;t like shopping, particularly when the
outlets are closed. Kick off was approaching fast. I could feel that I
was really close to Jorck&#8217;s Passage.</p>

<p>I had to nip this relationship in the bud. Now. &#8216;Do you fancy coming to
watch Eng-er-land play Spain, love and maybe get a kebab later ?&#8217; My
glamorous, shapely, dark haired Danish escort suddenly recognised her
best friend and ran away.</p>

<p>Got a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/70276096@N00/383224119/">Leffe</a> and
secured a blissfully unobstructed view of the big screen upstairs. After
20 minutes of boredom, the incessant Danish flirting started again.
Personally, I blame that (3 day old) Lynx aftershave. I asked the
beautiful waitress a perfectly innocuous question: &#8216;Is it possible to
order some food ?&#8217;</p>

<p>She leant over, plunging her cleavage over my pint, and whispered
breathlessly &#8216;If you can wait till after the match, I can give you my
very own Special for 10 Crowns&#8217;. I was speechless at this unsolicited
but very welcome advance until my neighbour, an Irish student
bricklayer, translated: &#8216;Yes. Surely. You can have a Irish Rover Beer &amp;
Burger international friendly football special for just 10 Kroner&#8217;.</p>

<p>Sigh. Another chance gone.</p>

<p>Oh and here comes the match report. A very uninspiring, mediocre team in
white lost 1-0 to an unadventurous team in red with silly haircuts.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Many years ago, a customer thanked me which was a pleasant surprise and
quite unusual. Most simply ask &#8216;When will your report be ready ?&#8217;</p>

<p>This particular customer remarked on my &#8216;logical and methodical
approach&#8217; to understanding this long standing complex problem, proposing
a plan of action and, on this rare occasion, resolving it.</p>

<p>I was interested by his choice of the words &#8216;logical and methodical&#8217;. As
an aside, I was convinced I heard a surly DBA murmur &#8216;slow, laboured and
hopeless more like&#8217; which hurt terribly.</p>

<p>Anyway, I don&#8217;t believe that I have a &#8216;logical and methodical&#8217; approach
to problem solving. My approach is born from laziness.</p>

<p>For example, if you have 27 users synchronising 176 objects of 5
different types between two IT systems, there is a lot of data to
analyse. When you increase the logging on both systems at all tiers, you
get even more data to analyse. So much data that your head explodes.</p>

<p>Reducing the number of synchronising users to 1, the number of objects
to be synchronised to 1 and limiting the direction of synchronisation to
one-way isn&#8217;t necessarily logical. It is laziness and merely reduces the
amount of log files to a manageable volume so you are merely left with a
splitting headache.</p>

<p>Sometimes, it may appear like wasted time and effort to stop staring at
a monitor and painstakingly review yet again all the previous history,
ask the same questions again and possibly repeat test scenarios that
have already been executed many times by miscellaneous disgruntled
parties. There is simply no substitute for seeing the evidence with your
own eyes.</p>

<p>Similarly, many years ago, I used to quite literally get a detailed
trace of a working system and a broken system (&#8216;let&#8217;s look at the good
versus the bad&#8217;) and look for divergence. Occasionally, I still resort
to this technique which can still prove to be effective.</p>

<p>This approach can be viewed as a little undergraduate-esque by
non-technical people who expect expensive consultants just to waltz in
and say &#8216;Oh yeah. I saw this very problem last week in Kazbakistan. You
just need to set the undocumented, unsupported and mythical parameter:
_firewall_auth=trusted. Right, anyone for lunch ?&#8217;</p>

<p>Making use of other resources could also be viewed as lazy but never
underestimate the knowledge and experience of the available technical
resources who may have different backgrounds and areas of expertise and
hence a contrary and valuable view on the underlying problem.</p>

<p>People (myself included) often limit their analysis to the areas they
know most about.</p>

<p>Right - anyone fancy a walk to that Copenhagen <a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/04/25/sports-bars-of-europe-2/">sports
bar</a>
for England versus Spain ?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Over the past couple of days, much to my surprise, I have actually
managed to answer some questions.</p>

<ol>
<li>The parameter &#8216;ExtractStartDate&#8217; was set to &#8216;11/01/2007&#8217;. This means
that Siebel will ignore all appointments and tasks prior to this
date. The default value of &#8216;ExtractStartDateFormat&#8217; is &#8216;MM/DD/YYYY&#8217;
which equates to &#8216;01 November 2007&#8217;.</li>
<li>Install Cygwin, sed -n -e &#8216;x,yp&#8217; &lt; bigfile.log</li>
<li>If the Exchange Connector and SSSE Engine component are run by
accounts in different domains, trust must be established in order
for RPC calls to work correctly. Alternatively, use two separate
accounts (least privilege) in the same domain.</li>
<li>In the heart of London, surprisingly.</li>
<li>Install OHS from the OAS Companion
<a href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/software/products/ias/htdocs/1013.html">CD</a></li>
<li>F11</li>
</ol>


<p>And now for the questions&#8230;</p>

<ol>
<li>Why, oh why, does Siebel stubbornly refuse to synchronise any of my
appointments and ToDo&#8217;s to Outlook ?</li>
<li>How do you print lines x to y of a file too large for notepad ?</li>
<li>Why, oh why, don&#8217;t multiple SSSE engines on different servers work ?</li>
<li>Where is London City Airport exactly ?</li>
<li>Where do you get the version of OHS (with Apache 2.x) needed for
Siebel 8.0 ?</li>
<li>How do you switch from full screen mode back to console in VMware ?</li>
</ol>


<p>I am probably most proud of number 6. If only all my answers were as
succinct and technically correct.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Travel Administrator for overpaid and unbelievably stupid IT consultant</p>

<ul>
<li>must be capable of using a corporate travel service to book a flight
to Copenhagen from London Heathrow</li>
<li>must be capable of reading confirmation email to check flight is
actually from LHR and not London City airport</li>
<li>must be able to secure approvals for travel booked less than 7 days
from departure</li>
<li>must be able to verify a flexible ticket has indeed been issued as
requested</li>
<li>must be able to convince the lady at SAS ticket sales to change a
fixed, non-refundable, non-changeable ticket to a different flight
at no additional cost</li>
</ul>


<p>Salary - none.
Bonus - none although you will receive my eternal thanks and defer my
next nervous breakdown.</p>

<p>Benefits - you can blog about your idiotic boss right here every
weekday.</p>
