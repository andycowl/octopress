  <div class="entry-content"><p>I don&#8217;t know if al the clever Spanish people who study English leave the
country or whether translators aren&#8217;t very well paid in Spain but here&#8217;s
some amusing signs from my recent holiday in Marbella.</p>

<p>
> ‘Deposit all remainders here&#8217; - Malaga airport.

<p>
I duly placed ‘2&#8217; in the receptacle. This was left over when I was
testing Norman Jeane and asked her to quickly divide 12 by 5.

> ‘Millionaires - Private Gentleman&#8217;s Club. Members only. Please always
> use rear entrance&#8217; - Puerto Banus.

Superb English. Nothing wrong with it at all. I suspect [Finbarr
Saunders][] of Viz was commissioned for this wonderful sign.

> ‘Please wait 3 minutes before pulsating&#8217; - water bottle dispenser in
> public car park in Ronda.

I am ashamed to say I could only last 2 minutes and 43 seconds before
spontaneously and rapidly pulsating. The car park attendant looked at me
a little strangely.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>With no Premiership or Championship fixtures at the weekend, I went
along to watch my local non league club, Kingstonian FC, play on
Saturday afternoon.</p>

<p>[<img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_l2uGy1RGCiE/TITRcFe6s-I/AAAAAAAABnM/SbHHvKLtzJ4/s400/KFC.jpg" alt="image" />][]</p>

<p>Kingstonian play in the Isthmian League which is a regional league below
the Conference (sponsored by Ryman so also known as the Ryman League)
and were hosting Margate.</p>

<p>It was great to be able to saunter round to the half way line and watch
the match from behind the dugouts. It was great to hear the coaches
urging their players on and engaging in gentle banter with the match
officials - ‘Here Lino - that [offside] had to be bloody close !&#8217; It was
refreshing to be able to walk into the bar and get a drink at half-time.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the football served up in the first half was rather
nondescript with Margate having the bulk of possession but creating
relatively few chances.</p>

<p>After the break, Kingstonian offered a little more threat, particularly
down the left side through full back Tom Bird and midfielder Dean Lodge
and Margate were thwarted by a couple of great saves from Rob Tolfrey in
the Kingston goal.</p>

<p>Against the run of play but to the delight of the assembled 400 home
spectators, Kingstonian nicked a goal and 3 points with a well taken
goal from Lodge after 84 minutes. Kingstonian are now joint top of the
Ryman League, trailing local rivals Sutton United on goal difference.</p>

<p>‘Where&#8217;s the crane then ?&#8217;</p>

<p>We had just embarked on our summer vacation to sunny Marbella (near
Spain) and were sitting on the shuttle bus taking us and our suitcases
from long stay parking to the North terminal at Gatwick airport.</p>

<p>‘Sorry what did you say ?&#8217;</p>

<p>‘The crane that gets the cars - where is it ?&#8217;</p>

<p>As I pondered what on earth my intelligent teenage son was on about, I
sensed other passengers on the bus pricking up their ears in interest.
The bus was now deathly quiet, in a very British way, as the small
audience attentively and patiently waited for the next exciting exchange
in this bizarre conversation.</p>

<p>‘Sorry, son but what on earth are you talking about ?&#8217;</p>

<p>‘Well - we came to one of these massive car parks at this airport a few
years ago when we went to Florida…&#8217;</p>

<p>‘Yes - I remember. It&#8217;s because it&#8217;s cheaper than getting a taxi and
more convenient than catching the train.&#8217;</p>

<p>‘Yes. Well back then I looked at the massive car park area packed with
loads of parked cars. Row after row of parked cars, all tightly crammed
in, and I asked you &#8216;How do they get the cars out when people return
from their holiday ?&#8217;</p>

<p>I listened intently together with the other thirteen people on the
‘Summer Special&#8217; shuttle bus and sensed the driver was also now
captivated.</p>

<p>‘And you (nods in my direction) told me that a massive crane swung round
to the correct row, dropped down to the exact postion, lifted up the
car, rotated back round and slowly lowered the car precisely into
position on the exit lane.&#8217;</p>

<p>I made a spluttering noise as I tried to stifle my laughter. ‘Sorry. I
said what ? No, no - I never said that.&#8217;</p>

<p>Norma Jeane now piped up ‘Oh yeah - I remember now. You did say that.&#8217;</p>

<p>People looked away. I could see them thinking ‘Oh - look at that tall,
handsome teenage boy. He looks perfectly normal but he actually attends
Special School and now his selfless parents are taking him away for a
lovely holiday.&#8217;</p>

<p>‘So - where&#8217;s the crane then ?&#8217;</p>

<p>‘Norman Junior - listen. I might have said that as a joke when you were
6 years old but the cars are parked in lanes according to the date and
times when people are scheduled to arrive back at the airport. For
example, all the cars for tomorrow will be parked in lane 27 with cars
belonging to people getting back in the early morning parked at the
front. Then the men just drive the cars round ready for people as they
arrive.&#8217;</p>

<p>‘Oh - so there&#8217;s no crane then ?&#8217;</p>

<p>‘No - sorry son but there&#8217;s no crane.&#8217; I could no longer contain myself
and burst out laughing.</p>

<p>My son looked disconsolate and fell silent.</p>

<p>‘Son - you haven&#8217;t told any of your mates at school this little story,
have you ?&#8217;</p>

<p>‘Nah. All that worries me now is how many other little stories you&#8217;ve
told me over the years.&#8217;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>On Tuesday morning, as I stood on a hot, sweaty, overcrowded South
West Train destined for London Waterloo, I happened to notice a
pretty, young lady reading a magazine telling her what to wear, how to
style her hair and how to look.</p>

<p>As I finally emerged from Bank station, the thoughts of skinny,
overpaid, drug taking women as some sort of bizarre role model
continued to rattle around my head. Inspired I decided to put my
thoughts down on paper - or rather brickwork.</p>

<p>Exclusive, signed, numbered prints are now available for just
&pound;8,995. If you look very carefully, elements of the tie have
been shaded using some of Peter Doherty&#8217;s blood.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just pulled some ancient, fuzzy photos from my toy phone including one
that captures a wonderful notice in a toilet in an unnamed, anonynmous,
large corporation looking for significant financial savings in Q4.</p>

<blockquote><p>In 2009, we spent &pound;75,000 unblocking toilets at HQ. Items found

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last night, Sky News played audio footage of Raoul Moat&#8217;s last moments.
This included detailed analysis of the sounds by an expert of the three
‘gunshots&#8217; and some idle chit-chat about whether someone was screaming
‘Aaarrgh - my arm&#8217; (Moat) or ‘Get the firearm&#8217; (police officers).</p>

<p>No matter what Moat was or what he had done, that was simply a step too
far and unacceptable in my opinion.</p>

<p>This broadcast was not in the public interest and breached the standards
of normal, common decency.</p>

<p>The media should not have been allowed within 2 miles of the standoff
with police, let alone allowed to film and record the final moments of a
man&#8217;s life.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A tragic <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/tyne/10549296.stm">story</a> is unfolding in the North of England with a gunman on
the run after killing one person and seriously injuring two more (his
ex-girlfriend and a traffic policeman) following his release from prison
last Friday.</p>

<p>Obviously, the police are doing everything to apprehend Raoul Moat
safely without any further loss of life. However, as Moat claims he has
‘lost everything&#8217; and is determined to ‘wage war on the police&#8217;, it&#8217;s
not clear this episode will reach a peaceful conclusion.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, the town of Rothbury was locked down; a two mile exclsuion
zone was put in place, schools were closed and residents were told to
stay indoors as Northumbria police thought they were closing in on the
armed and dangerous suspect.</p>

<p>However, two days later, Moat is still on the loose so the town of
Rothbury has now been reopened with a very visible police presence on
the streets.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not sure how I would have felt popping to the corner shop for a
newspaper and a pint of milk, to find policemen stood at every corner
given Moat&#8217;s declaration to ‘keep killing police until I am dead&#8217;. Far
from being reassuring, this police presence would probably scare me even
more.</p>

<p>‘Norma, love - you couldn&#8217;t just pop out and get some milk, could you ?
Thanks.&#8217;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>[ Working title: Torture on a shoestring ]</p>

<p>A couple of weeks ago on a normal, routine Tuesday morning, I did what I
do every morning; showered, prepared for work and cleaned my ears out
with a cotton wool bud. As I went to leave the bathroom, I swung my arms
up and around to put my dressing gown back on for the short trip down
the upstairs landing.</p>

<p>[ This requirement to be modestly covered up follows an unfortunate
incident in April 2009 when my teenage daughter had a sleepover with
three friends staying over. Apparently, one poor girl can not even look
at a Chippolata sausage ever again. Needless to say, I conducted my own
defence and was acquitted. Again. ]</p>

<p>Anyway, as I simulataneously hoisted both arms up to don my long,
flowing, white, silk robe adorned with ‘MUFC - Champions 2008&#8217; on the
back, I felt pain. A lot of pain. Searing pain that made me feel quite
dizzy. I paused for breath and suddenly realised I had inadvertently
rammed a cotton wool bud, deep and hard, into my right ear.</p>

<p>It was so painful, I didn&#8217;t even shout, exclaim or swear. Instinctively,
I reached for my right ear and gingerly extracted the cotton wool bud. I
felt more pain. I clasped my hand over my ear and half expected my palm
to be dripping in blood. Thankfully, there was no blood - just numbing
pain.</p>

<p>I gingerly made my way back to my bedroom and sat down as I felt quite
faint. After a few minutes, the pain subsided slightly to a constant,
painful throb and I was able to get up and get dressed.</p>

<p>I am constantly amazed at the human body&#8217;s resilience and powers of
natural healing so I just waited for the ear to heal. The next few days
were quite interesting; the feeling was similar to what I would expect
after standing adjacent to a 30 foot Marshall amp stack for the full 3
days of Glastonbury with slight loss of hearing, ringing, dull pain and
various popping noises similar to the sensation you get when descending
in a aircraft.</p>

<p>Eventually, Norma asked why I was popping Nurofen all day every day so I
had to own up. As expected, she took great delight in my agony as she‘d
always claimed ears were self-regulating organs and simply do not need
to be cleaned daily with a blunt instrument which causes more harm than
good. She showed me great sympathy by saying: &#8216;Well, I bet it was
absolutely nothing like child birth.&#8217;</p>

<p>I pondered on this for a while and concluded she was right - I had
merely rammed a very small, narrow foreign object into the human body
via a small orifice with great force whereas childbirth consists of
ejecting a natural body out of the human body via a, err, slightly
larger orifice with moderate force. However, I decided it might be
prudent to maintain a dignifed silence (in case she slapped me on the
ear) and the very thought ot childbirth and bodily fluids made me feel
slightly queasy again.</p>

<p>Days passed but the pain and odd sensations didn&#8217;t so I went to see my
Doctor primarily as I had some concerns about flying in a plane with a
perforated eardrum.</p>

<p>Inevitably, the consulation with my GP was livened up by me pretending
not to hear when she opened up with ‘Now, Mr. Brightside, how can I help
you today ?&#8217; and I responded with ‘Sorry - what did you say ?&#8217;, ‘Pardon&#8217;
and ‘Can you speak up a little ? I have a slight problem with my right
ear.&#8217;</p>

<p>As I sheepishly confessed to my idiotic, self-inflicted act of
stupidity, the Doctor listened attentively and nodded knowlingly -
&#8216;Don&#8217;t worry Mr. Brightside. I&#8217;ve seen people who&#8217;ve inserted all sorts
of things into all sorts of, err, irregular, places.&#8217;</p>

<p>Fair play to the lady GP. She immediately grabbed her menacing ear probe
with the triangular metal end and integrated torchlight and responded
with ‘OK then, let&#8217;s have a good look in &#8216;ere&#8217; and the odd ‘Ooh - what
have we &#8216;ere ?&#8217;.</p>

<p>She gently inserted her probe (soft porn SEO keyword search alert) and
promptly reported the ear was too inflamed to see whether the ear drum
was intact or perforated. She reassured me (sort of) by saying the cabin
pressure in a plane wouldn&#8217;t be an issue if the eardrum was perforated
as the air would simply ‘whistle straight through the hole&#8217;.</p>

<p>She then asked me if I had any other specific worries or questions and I
replied ‘Not really - it&#8217;s mainly the prospect of flying. Oh and I did
want to ask you about the leaking brain fluid…&#8217; ‘Brain fluid ?&#8217;, she
interjected in a serious tone. ‘Yes - when I wake up my pillow has all
this yellow/brown-ish liquid where my head&#8217;s been resting and my wife,
who is a qualified nurse, told me it was just my &#8216;brain fluid&#8217; leaking
out.&#8217;</p>

<p>‘Well - with respect, I think your wife might be mistaken or having a
little joke. I&#8217;m pretty sure this is just residual fluid from the
inflamed area as the body recovers but I&#8217;ll prescribe you some
antibiotics which will help clear up the infection.&#8217;</p>

<p>The ear is now almost completely healed. I have thrown away the bumper
pack of 240 ear buds although my right earbud now keeps falling out on
when I listen to music on the train.</p>

<p>The memory of the ‘ear drum&#8217; incident is now receding but I&#8217;m pretty
sure intelligence agencies and the military could use this technique to
produce a cheaper and much more efficient form of torture.
<a href="http://davidmarsden.info/waterboarding-on-the-nhs">Waterboarding</a> is well publicised and effective but can get very
messy and is very wasteful of a precious natural resource.</p>

<p>Imagine, in the next James Bond film, the baddie enters the
interrogation cell armed - not with a large belt or a car battery and
two electrical diodes - but simply brandishing a single cotton wool bud.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am about to embark on migrating this blog from WordPress to
Django-Mingus because I simply can&#8217;t stand the WordPress &#8216;Compose Post&#8217;
interface (if you can call it that).</p>

<p>This exciting move comes less than two weeks after I spotaneously
decided to ditch Habari after the lack of a functional &#8216;Auto-Save&#8217;
plugin caused me to lose 17 minutes work.</p>

<p>You may say &#8216;I&#8217;m reading this in my preferred RSS reader so please don&#8217;t
bother me with such minutiae&#8217;.</p>

<p>However, when I migrated from Habari to WordPress a month ago, I flooded
you both with my most recent posts duplicated so this is just prior
warning that similar oddness may well occur as I endeavour to hook up
the new blog feed to FeedBurner.</p>

<p>This may or may not signal a period of blog hopping and I&#8217;d like to say
this <del>will</del> may trigger a series of interesting posts about which
blogging platforms I considered and discarded and top tips on planning
and executing an efficient blog migration.</p>
