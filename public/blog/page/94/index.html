  <div class="entry-content"><p>Airports are pretty dull places. Last Wednesday, I found myself at
Heathrow T2, at some unearthly hour in the morning. I wandered round
Dixons to have a quick look at the latest gadgets and kill some
time. I happened to see a couple of items I was interested in. The
first was Microsoft Office 2003 for Student Edition (3 user
license). I had already seen this on Amazon at 91GBP and Dixon&#8217;s tax
free price was 110GBP which was, err, twenty pounds more
expensive. So, not exactly a brilliant saving at Dixons Tax Free
shopping there.</p>

<p>Secondly, a cheap MP3 player (Logik 1GB). This was only 63GBP at
Heathrow which was odd because the identical model is available for
only 54GBP in my local Dixons on the high street and has also been
advertised recently in the national press. So, another triumph for so
called Tax Free shopping at Dixons.</p>

<p>Even more odd is that Dixons have a large poster at the entrance to
the store proclaiming &#8216;We beat Amazon/Tesco/Argos prices&#8217;. Now in the
light of my very limited price comparison of just two items, that
poster would seem to be misleading at best, downright dishonest at
worst and possibly in breach of trading standards regulations.</p>

<p>The poster implies to potential customers that Dixons are proactively
monitoring prices at three other major competitors and undercutting
their prices so you can buy from Dixons with confidence. I realise
that Dixons are under massive pressure from UK supermarkets (who sell
cheap DVD players alongside Cornflakes) and internet retailers. In
addition, Dixons&#8217; profits have also been badly hit by the decision to
stop forcing lucrative, extended warranties onto customers but is this
really the way to win business back.</p>

<p>Out of interest, I sent an email to Dixons for their thoughts&#8230;.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was flying back from Dusseldorf to London on Lufthansa
yesterday. For some reason, the kind lady at the check-in desk,
upgraded me to business class so I got a nice bread roll and cloth
napkin. The gentleman next to me was very disappointed that there were
no English language newspapers available on board. When the steward
asked why he didn&#8217;t pick one up at the gate, he became even more
irritated, telling him in no uncertain terms that there were no
&#8216;English&#8217; newspapers at the gate and worse, not a single &#8216;English&#8217;
newspaper in the business lounge.</p>

<p>So he finally settled down with a copy of &#8216;The Economist&#8217; or so I
thought. Next thing the senior cabin director was summoned. This time
the gentleman, still, obviously disgruntled asked &#8216;Are you trying to
cater for an international audience ?&#8217; The lady politely explained the
situation, apologised once again and offered to scour the plane for a
paper. Then he said &#8216;What&#8217;s the point of me paying extra money to fly
business class if you can&#8217;t even offer me an English newspaper ?&#8217; and
finally let the subject die.</p>

<p>Two things struck me:
-   I bet his company, or more likely, his client are the ones paying</p>

<pre><code>the premium for business class and not him.
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>I was simply dying to say &#8216;Well next time you fly on British Airways
at 17.00 on a Friday to any German destination, why don&#8217;t you see
how many copies of &#8216;Die Welt&#8217; and &#8216;Der Spiegel&#8217; are available for
German passengers ?&#8217;</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just created an RSS feed for my blog using
<a href="https://www.feedburner.com/">Feedburner</a>. It was actually quite
interesting to see how my blog was presented in different RSS readers
(Thunderbird, Google Reader and Bloglines) where the textual content
is the same but may be presented in many different ways and styles.</p>

<p>I once lost quite a long, rambling blog entry due to some finger
trouble in the blogger editor so subscribing to the RSS feed will be a
quick and easy way to backup the blog.</p>

<p>Another nice feature of Feedburner is that it will automatically ping
a number of sources when the blog is updated.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Creating this blog was an experiment and, somewhat to my surprise, I
quite like the concept. So I have decided to host my blog on my Web
space over at blueyonder. This isn&#8217;t because I think Telewest&#8217;s
hosting service is any more reliable than blogger (never had any
issues at all with blogger) but so I can peruse the Web server logs
and referrer statistics that Blueyonder kindly gather for me. The
transfer of the blog went surprisingly smoothly and I created a
placeholder blog to grab the old namespace on blogger.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Google have launched an online RSS
<a href="http://www.google.com/reader/things/tour">Reader</a>. Like most
developments from Google, this looks very professional and fits in
with their rapidly growing suite of software products. Although I
currently use Thunderbird for reading (a very limited number of) RSS
sources and blogs, the use of a Web based service to manage all my
information sources, accessible from anywhere, is appealing.</p>

<p>I experimented by setting up one source (BBC News) and one thing about
the interface immediately struck me like a thunderbolt !</p>

<p>The use of the &#8216;j&#8217; and &#8216;k&#8217; keys to move the article list up and
down. It is just like the good old trusty (and much maligned) Unix
editor &#8216;vi&#8217;.  Now this may appeal to Unix users but I am not sure
whether the new generation of IE users will make of the &#8216;oh but for
touch typists, it is so much faster&#8217; argument.</p>

      </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I used to use Yahoo Bookmarks which maintains a list of Web sites that
I could access from any computer. This was a nice idea but I found I
didn&#8217;t use (or maintain) the bookmarks regularly and the links
gradually fell into a state of disrepair. For my most frequently
accessed Web sites, I would simply type the start of the address into
the browser and simply let auto-complete do its work which was
quicker.</p>

<p>A couple of weeks ago, Yahoo launched <a href="http://uk.search.yahoo.com/myresults/benefits">My
Web</a>which overhauled
the bookmarks functionality and added the ability to save a copy of
the Web page so that the referenced content was preserved in the event
that the Web site was subsequently moved or deleted. However, My Web
still uses a hierarchical system of folders to store the
bookmarks. For example, the Manchester United home page would
typically be stored in a folder named &#8216;Sport-Football-Manchester
United&#8217;.</p>

<p>Then I discovered social bookmarking (Furl, del.ico.us, spurl) which
also saves the state of the Web page and maintains a personal,
searchable archive (just like My Web). However, the key difference
with <a href="http://www.furl.net/">Furl</a>(et al) is that all Web pages for all
users are stored on a central server. For any Web page, Furl can then
quickly display similar, related, associated pages which have also
been stored by different Furl users. This is what those Web 2.0 people
call &#8216;social bookmarking&#8217;.</p>

<p>Another difference is that Furl&#8217;ed pages does not use a hierarchical
structure. Instead, stored pages are simply associated with various
tags. So, in the earlier example, the Manchester United home page
might be tagged as &#8216;Sport&#8217;, &#8216;Football&#8217; and &#8216;Manchester&#8217;. Note that,
unlike My Web, the bookmarked Furl page can be associated with
multiple categories. Tagging is the key to effective searching with
Furl.</p>

<p>This feature is really useful. For example, I am currently interested
in using Microsoft
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/uk/office/onenote/prodinfo/default.mspx">OneNote</a>
as a single repository to store information, emails, jottings, to do
lists, articles, and even Outlook notes. OneNote has a couple of
disadvantages; it uses a proprietary format and is a commercial
product.  So I searched SourceForge and Freshmeat for an OpenSource
alternative without much success. Then I discovered
<a href="http://www.tranglos.com/free/keynote.html">KeyNote</a> which looked
promising but wasn&#8217;t much different from using outline mode in Emacs.</p>

<p>Then I stumbled across <a href="http://www.evernote.com/en/">EverNote</a> and,
using Furl, immediately got directed towards some more interesting Web
based organiser applications like
<a href="http://www.backpackit.com/">BackPack</a>,
<a href="http://query.jot.com/">JotSpot</a> and possibly even
<a href="http://tiddlywiki.com/">TiddlyWiki</a> all of which immediately get
furled.</p>

<p>Another subtle way that Furl affected my usage was that previously I
might stumble across a Web site of interest but could not be bothered
to file it as (subconsciously) I didn&#8217;t want to clutter up my nicely
organized bookmarks. With Furl, I tended to add the Web site
regardless and simply tag the page as &#8216;Of interest&#8217;.</p>

<p>Another possible use for Furl is to capture ideas for blogs. When you
see a Web site of interest, simply tag it as &#8216;Ideas for Blog&#8217; together
with a short comment.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I use Telewest Broadband and today I received an email informing me
that my broadband service had been upgraded to from 1MB to 4Mb free of
charge. As I am currently paying 25 GBP per month for the broadband
connection, it is really a case of Telewest trying to keep up with the
competition to avoid customers switching provider rather than a
spontaneous act of goodwill.</p>

<p>And as if that wasn&#8217;t enough excitement for one day, I then noticed
that &#8216;Teleport&#8217; (TV and video on demand) had appeared on my digital TV
service as well. This promised me the chance to pause/rewind any of my
favourite TV programs I had missed on the first showing. However, when
I scanned the list, the choice was quite limited and fairly
uninspiring - BBC News, Booze Britain, Eastenders, Most Haunted.</p>

<p>In fact, the only two TV programs I would want replayed are &#8216;Lost&#8217; and
&#8216;Early Doors&#8217; so I guess I will stick with the old video recorder
technology, record those on to tape and still be able to use those
pause/rewind facilities.</p>

<p>Teleport Movies just seemed like FrontRow rebranded but with slightly
more films available and the fact that you can choose the start time
and view the film over an extended time period.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A lot of people make a lot of money out of customer relationship
management (CRM) but here is a real-life example of how customer
service affects the relationship with the customer.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago I ordered a wireless USB card and a CD (Antics by
Interpol) from Amazon. I received the normal &#8216;Your order has been
dispatched&#8217; email within 24 hours. I waited for 10 days but nothing
turned up which was unusual because normally Amazon deliver pretty
promptly (even with the SuperSaver option).</p>

<p>I know the package hasn&#8217;t been left on my doorstep in the pouring rain
by the postman and subsequently stolen as I specified the delivery
address as my place of work, specifically, to avoid this.</p>

<p>So I send Amazon a polite email informing them of the problem and
asking what can be done.</p>

<p>Amazon replied promptly, helpfully confirming when the package was
dispatched and that, unfortunately, there was no way of tracking the
item.</p>

<ul>
<li>Please note that we take full responsibility should any item become
lost or damaged while being delivered, and we are more than happy to
replace these items at a cost to ourselves. If your package does not
arrive by September 23, 2005, please contact us to confirm that it has
not been received and that your delivery address is correct for your
order, so we can investigate and take the appropriate action. *</li>
</ul>


<p>Now what was interesting about this reply was:</p>

<ul>
<li>Amazon actually read my email and answered my specific questions. It
was not a standard form letter.</li>
<li>If, after waiting two weeks and checking the delivery address was
correct, the package still did not turn up, Amazon were prepared to
send me the goods free of charge for a second time.</li>
</ul>


<p>Anyway, this story had a happy ending as the package was actually
sitting in the post room at work and they had simply forgotten to
inform me.</p>

<p>Now, after I made the initial order I discovered I could have got the
identical wireless USB card off the shelf for the same price, without
any delay in Tesco and I could have saved a whole three pounds (33%)
on the CD (at CD-WOW!).</p>

<p>However this excellent customer service gives me a increased level of
confidence of buying goods from Amazon. Could I be guaranteed the same
response if another, more expensive package from another retailer went
missing ?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>According to
<a href="http://www.technorati.com/weblog/2005/08/34.html">Technorati</a>, a new
Web log is created every second which is an amazing statistic and
about 55% remain active which is even more staggering.</p>

<p>The creation of my blog was actually a little experiment to see what
all the fuss was about and, secondly, to see how long it would take
for someone to wander along and be motivated enough to add a comment
to the blog.</p>

<p>I did not publicise the blog in any way (mainly because I haven&#8217;t got
any friends) apart from adding it to blogger listing and I was curious
to see if it would ever generate any traffic or interest.</p>

<p>So today, one month and eleven days after I created this blog, I
received the first comment from someone in Germany. My life is
complete - almost.</p>
