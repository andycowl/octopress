  <div class="entry-content"><p>Curiously, after reading about the Picasa
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/03/08/picasa-web-albums-upgraded-to-1gb/">upgrade</a>,
a related article about photo management software popped up in Google
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/02/18/resisting-the-lure-of-google-reader/">Reader</a>,
courtesy of Robert <a href="http://scobleizer.com/">Scoble</a>&#8217;s excellent <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/shared/14480565058256660224">link
blog</a>.</p>

<p>Robert Scoble had published a couple of podcasts featuring a product
<a href="http://www.podtech.net/home/technology/2313/sharpcast-demo-brings-simple-way-to-manage-photos">demo</a>
and an
<a href="http://www.podtech.net/home/technology/2312/talking-about-web-20-photo-and-file-sync">interview</a>
with Gibu Thomas, CEO of <a href="https://www.sharpcast.com/">Sharpcast</a>.
Sharpcast is yet another photo management software tool and appears to
offer a number of advantages over <a href="http://picasa.google.com/">Picasa</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Unlimited free storage</li>
<li>Automatic synchronisation between PC and Web albums</li>
<li>Original images are preserved</li>
</ul>


<p>The unlimited storage seems too good to be true and is very useful
because, at some point in the near future, I am likely to exceed
Picasa&#8217;s storage limit unless Google follow suit.
Secondly, if I ever edit an image or perform any housekeeping, I will
have to manually replicate those changes to Picasa Web Albums. As I am
very
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/01/27/unix-for-lazy-people/">lazy</a>,
that is unlikely to happen.</p>

<p>Finally, I have always presumed that Flickr and Picasa are compressing
the images to degrade the quality of my professional photographs to save
space and bandwidth. However, that is fine as you get what you pay for
and I am paying nothing. Obviously, it is preferable to have the
original, unmodified image available without having to continually burn
another CD/DVD.</p>

<p>So I signed up for Sharpcast, downloaded the desktop software and
quickly synchronised the &#8216;My Pictures&#8217; folder to the server.</p>

<p>Sharpcast was very fast and easy to use. I was able to synchronise and
upload 1,062 photos with a single click. This took less time than
uploading the same content from Picasa. Although you can upload multiple
albums in Picasa, one album is uploaded at at time and the remainder are
queued.</p>

<p>Sharpcast is a genuine competitor to Flickr and Picasa and in the
podcast, Gibu talks about extending the range of files to include
documents. Sharpcast also includes support for Mac users and mobile
phones.</p>

<p>My only reservation is that Sharpcast really does seem too good to be
true. I am also a little hazy about the business model. It is not clear
if this is Web 2.0 beta software which will subsequently charge or
whether Sharpcast will attempt to make money from additional services.
Currently the only paid service is photo printing.</p>

the amount of free storage to 1GB (previously 250MB) available at

<p>This means I can now backup all of my photos comfortably (854MB) in one

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I celebrated my recent promotion (to <a href="http://www.flybmi.com/bmi/en-gb/frequentflyers/membershipbenefits/silvermembership.aspx">BMI
Silver</a>)
by ordering a brand new Dell
<a href="http://www1.euro.dell.com/content/products/features.aspx/desktops_better?c=uk&amp;cs=ukdhs1&amp;l=en&amp;s=dhs">computer</a>
running Windows Vista (Premium) and proudly attaching the tag to my
suitcase.</p>

<p>I then spent hours ensuring I had secured the
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2005/10/29/beware-of-shopping-at-dell-computers/">cheapest</a>
price possible and placed the order at 23:12 on Sunday night. Yesterday
afternoon, I received a call from Dell confirming delivery for Thursday
(at an unspecified time somewhere in a 10 hour window between 08:00 and
18:00).</p>

<p>So it appears that the assembly line at Dell is either very efficient or
currently has spare capacity. If you hold stock in Dell and are hoping
for better
<a href="http://today.reuters.co.uk/news/articlenews.aspx?type=tnBusinessNews&amp;storyID=2007-03-01T221303Z_01_WEN5003_RTRIDST_0_BUSINESS-DELL-RESULTS-DC.XML">results</a>
this quarter, don&#8217;t hold your breath.</p>

<p>Reminds me of the old joke about the Manchester City fan who calls Maine
Road</p>

<p>&#8216;Eh mate. What time&#8217;s kick-off tonight ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Dunno - what time do you think you can get down here ?&#8217;.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Like most people, I store information in many different places. Lots of
data is stored directly on my work laptop while yet more data is stored
on my computer at home.</p>

<ul>
<li>Mail folders</li>
<li>Address book</li>
<li>Text files</li>
<li>Corporate blogs</li>
<li>Presentations</li>
<li>Word documents</li>
<li>Intranet resources</li>
<li>Whitepapers</li>
<li>Web history</li>
<li>RSS feeds</li>
<li>Photos</li>
<li>Music</li>
</ul>


<p>Even more data is stored on external servers
-   Gmail
-   Blinklist
-   Web site, blogs and mySQL databases at Bluehost
-   Post-it on fridge
-   Mobile phone
-   Palm PDA
-   My head (last resort)</p>

<p>I first used <a href="http://desktop.google.com/">Google Desktop</a> a couple of
years ago when it was first launched. Back then, the ongoing indexing
process seemed to add a unreasonable load on my laptop, so I decided to
uninstall the program and revert to old-fashioned searching in Windows
Explorer and Outlook (and now Thunderbird).
However, recently I decided to give Google Desktop another go because I
am a Google
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/02/19/am-i-a-google-whore-yet/">whore</a>.
The initial index of the entire computer took a few hours to index a
grand total of 131,854 items (44,118 emails, 5,059 Web history and
82,677 files).</p>

<p>After the initial index was complete, the overhead of the ongoing index
process barely seemed noticeable (although my laptop has also been
upgraded to a higher specification in the interim).</p>

<p>Google Desktop scans email folders, text files, PDF, Powerpoint, Word
documents, Gmail and Web history. As you might expect, the search is
lightning fast, much faster than searching within Thunderbird although
the range of options isn&#8217;t as comprehensive.</p>

<p>I find myself using Google Desktop a lot. Often I am not looking for a
specific email, article or document but researching a topic, trying to
locate all possible relevant information from the different sources
available. Google Desktop makes this type of searching across multiple,
disparate data sources very easy and quick.</p>

<p>Google Desktop caches data locally so you can search Gmail folders and
even Web pages while offline. There is also a Preview option available.</p>

<p>I can also increase the accuracy and quality of my search results and
save some disk space by deleting dated, obsolete or irrelevant
information as I find it.</p>

<p>Another neat feature which worries the men in white (or black) hats is a
positive bonus to me. Google Desktop can be configured to search
documents and Web history from my home PC. This feature would be even
better if my domestic email folders could be included as this would
potentially enable me to reply to Dave&#8217;s email message about drinks next
Thursday or Friday from a hotel room in Prague.</p>

<p>Currently, I would have to call the wife, ask her to log on to the
computer, educate her how to search in Thunderbird, locate the correct
information and mail me the results. All of this is too much trouble
given she moans at being asked to perform the simple task of setting the
video to record
&#8217;<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/03/02/lost-without-lost/">Lost</a>&#8217;.</p>

<p>The only minor issue I have encountered thus far is that Google Desktop
does not search within WinZip archives despite claiming to &#8216;search the
full text of Zip files&#8217;. This is less than ideal as most of my formal
reports are Word documents zipped up to save space. Just as well then,
that there is precious little of technical value buried deep within
those archives.</p>

<p>Coincidentally, Google Desktop has just been
<a href="http://googledesktop.blogspot.com/2007/03/new-sidebar-and-gadgets.html">updated</a>
to 5.1 (beta) with a dark, transparent sidebar, improved gadget support
and enhanced security. Although I have experimented with the sidebar, I
don&#8217;t actually use this feature as I find it too invasive (i.e addictive
and time wasting).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Until 30 minutes ago, this blog was running Wordpress 2.1 courtesy of
the Fantastico installation at Bluehost. The blog was fairly stable and
worked fine.</p>

<p>However, I was investigating upgrading to WordPress 2.1.2 to plug a
<a href="http://wordpress.org/development/2007/03/upgrade-212/">security</a> issue.
The Fantastico Installer currently only offers an upgrade to the flawed
2.1.1 release.</p>

<p>In any case, the Fantastico installer now refuses to upgrade my
WordPress installation because I have installed new themes, configured
additional plug-ins and even added database tables to the schema.</p>

<p>So without any prior planning or forethought, I have been forced (by
that nagging voice in my head) to spontaneously install a brand new
instance of WordPress 2.1.2 and migrate my existing blog.</p>

<p>Consequently, this blog will be completely broken for the foreseeable
future. All comments will be lost. RSS feeds will stop refreshing. Most
plug-ins will stop working. Any hosted images will return &#8216;404 - Not
Found&#8217;. In fact, with my level of knowledge and incompetence, it is
likely that the complete blog will be lost forever.</p>

<p>Worse, my proudest invention, the rotating tagline, doesn&#8217;t work. This
is completely unintentional but at least, it means my tiny brain can
easily differentiate between the &#8216;old&#8217; and &#8216;new&#8217; blogs.</p>

<p>At last, I am now freed from the constraints of Fantastico and as The
Clash memorably sang, I now assume &#8216;Complete Control&#8217;.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&#8216;Good evening. Blueyond - sorry - Virgin Media Customer Services. Carol
speaking. How may I help you ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Slight problem. I can&#8217;t get Sky One any more.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes, Sir. I know [sighs inwardly &#8216;Oh God please not another one&#8217;].
Those nasty people from Sky increased the prices and Sir Richard called
their bluff. Unfortunately, a horrid Australian man called Rupert then
called his bluff back so we can&#8217;t show it any more.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;But isn&#8217;t that a prime example of the free market and competition in
operation that Richard keeps telling us about ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh no, Sir. This is a virtual monopoly that presents a real danger to
the media industry worldwide and all our valuable subscribers. Well
those that are left, anyway.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Well, why doesn&#8217;t Richard retaliate by charging Rupert 10 times more
for Living TV and Bravo+1 ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Sorry, Sir. We did look into that option but it turns there are only 23
people on Sky who regularly watch those channels.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;But you can&#8217;t do that. I spend my life nagging my kids to stop watching
&#8216;The Simpsons&#8217; and knuckle down to their homework. What am I supposed to
do now ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I know, Sir. We are very sorry for the inconvenience and upset caused.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Never mind that. Don&#8217;t you realise we are halfway through a series of
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/07/11/lost-life-mirrors-fiction/">Lost</a>
?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes. I know, Sir. I also enjoy that never ending, inane, tedious,
frustrating and yet somehow compelling
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/07/12/lost-computer-mystery-solved/">series</a>.
If it&#8217;s any consolation, I will now have to go round our Shirley&#8217;s in St
Helens every Wednesday night and make smalltalk with her idiotic husband
just to get my weekly fix. Come to think of it, I might move to Sky.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;How much refund will I get for the loss of the Sky channels ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Refund, Sir ? Err, well I&#8217;m not sure about that, Sir. You see, we
really didn&#8217;t expect it to come to this. However you can always watch
&#8216;Little Britain&#8217; and &#8216;Spooks&#8217; on the newly launched Video On Demand. The
marketing lady thinks you might like to call it VOD.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Sod VOD. I&#8217;m sorry but that&#8217;s simply not good enough. Please may I
speak to Richard Branston ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Sorry - do you mean Richard Branson ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yeah. That&#8217;s him. The chap in a white wedding dress with a silly
beard.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;m sorry. That won&#8217;t be possible. Maybe I can help ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Can you get a message to Richard ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Err, well, I&#8217;ll try, Sir.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Has he got Sky One in his palatial Oxford mansion ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Of course. I went there on my induction week. He&#8217;s also got Sky Plus
and a dodgy descrambler from eBay hooked up to receive satellite
channels to follow the South American Ballooning Championships.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Can you ask him whether I would be breaching the Terms and Conditions
by using a BitTorrent client to download the remaining episodes of
&#8216;Lost&#8217; ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Certainly, Sir. Anything else I can help you with regarding your
drastically reduced Virgin Media services tonight ? Perhaps you would
like to downgrade your Internet connection to 56K dialup (free modem)
for the same money. Or maybe I can tempt with with increased telephone
charges to mobile numbers ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yeah, well actually there is something. Please can I speak to Uma ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Sorry, Sir. Do you have a surname with that ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Thurman. Uma Thurman.&#8217;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Darren Prowse kicked off an interesting
<a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2007/02/27/what-makes-you-unsubscribe-from-a-blogs-rss-feed/">discussion</a>
asking what makes you unsubscribe from a feed.</p>

<p>This prompted me to revisit my list of my inactive blogs in Google
Reader. Normally, I tend to leave most blogs intact because I don&#8217;t
religously unsubscribe purely because an author hasn&#8217;t posted in a
while. However, I find it useful to occasionally check the status of
sleeping blogs to see whether the feed has actually died or migrated
elsewhere and prune my subscription list accordngly.</p>

<p>The blog on my reading list, showing the longest period of inactivity is
Andrew Campbell&#8217;s <a href="http://oracleandy.blogspot.com/">Oracle Stuff I Should Have
Known</a>. The last post to this blog was
made way back on 24 September 2006.</p>

<p>Now, this is an interesting, technical Oracle blog so I will remain
subscribed because the next post could be a gem and might even be
imminent. In any case, the beauty of RSS means I will be notified
whenever the blog is updated so I don&#8217;t have to waste any time checking
the site for updates.</p>

<p>However, what interested me more was the
<a href="http://my2.statcounter.com/project/standard/stats.php?account_id=938873&amp;login_id=1&amp;code=e37efadaffd6f953bfcc2cabdf6e1e16&amp;guest_login=1&amp;project_id=1288882">StatCounter</a>
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/70276096@N00/404537184/">statistics</a> for
Andy&#8217;s blog. Despite not being updated in five whole months, the blog
still attracts in excess of 3,000 unique visitors per month.</p>

<p>So that&#8217;s the secret then. I&#8217;m hibernating. See you all in July.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Stuart Brown from the excellent <a href="http://www.modernlifeisrubbish.co.uk/">Modern
Life</a> asks &#8216;Why is RSS adoption
so
<a href="http://www.modernlifeisrubbish.co.uk/article/why-is-rss-adoption-so-abysmal-amongst-uk-newspapers-online">abysmal</a>
amongst UK newspapers online ?&#8217; with some interesting analysis including
the staggering fact (to me at least) that Modern Life has more Bloglines
subscribers than The Daily Torygraph.</p>

<p>The detailed analysis in this article interested me. I (delude myself
that I) am technically literate. I subscribe to around 100 varied feeds
and am very lazy. I live in the UK and am interested in News, Sport and
Technology.</p>

<p>I always buy a newspaper whenever I commute on a train and every
Saturday (to avoid DIY). And yet, curiously, I do not subscribe to any
RSS feeds from any UK
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/06/14/the-imminent-death-of-newspapers/">newspapers</a>
(well apart from The Sun&#8217;s excellent &#8216;Unders The Covers With Page 3
Babes&#8217; podcast).</p>

<p>So I just visited the Web sites of the main broadsheets (Times,
Torygraph, Independent and Grauniad) to try to determine whether I am
missing out.</p>

<h2>The Times</h2>

<p>The Times recently relaunched the
<a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/global/">TimesOnline</a> site so it will
be interesting to see what RSS support is on offer.</p>

<p>Not a good start - no familiar orange RSS icon in the Firefox address
bar. No obvious subscription options is visible. Sure enough, the
&#8216;Newsfeeds&#8217; information is buried down at the bottom of the page as an
afterthought.</p>

<p>The Times offers a narrow choice of News (UK and World), Business,
Sport, Tech and the ever popular Law. There is no specific feed for
&#8216;Football&#8217; so I am obliged to take an interest in horse racing, darts
and snooker. No thanks.</p>

<p>As Andy Piper
<a href="http://andypiper.wordpress.com/2007/02/16/the-times-goes-rss/">noted</a>,
the title of the Sports feed is imaginatively titled &#8216;TimesOnline:rss&#8217;.
Like most UK media providers, The Times provides a
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/05/26/partial-versus-full-fe/">partial</a>
feed. Sigh.</p>

<h3>The Telegraph</h3>

<p>A promising <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/">start</a>. Automatic subscription
option available from Firefox to &#8216;Breaking News&#8217; and almost every area
of the site. There are specific feeds for individual sports and the
Football feed is sensibly called &#8216;Telegraph Sport | Football&#8217;.</p>

<p>There is a useful help
<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/portal/main.jhtml?xml=/portal/rss/exclusions/rssinfo.xml">page</a>
describing the various subscription options which is useful for
newcomers (including a NetVibes module). There is support for Blackberry
and a mobile service for registered users (free subscription).</p>

<h3>The Independent</h3>

<p>Like The Times, <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/">The Independent</a> does
not offer automatic RSS and hides subscription information at the bottom
of the page. Range of subscription options but I completely turn off
when asked to select the section(s) and then get presented with a feed
URL to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/70276096@N00/404469891/">paste</a>
into my RSS reader !</p>

<p>Reluctantly, paste the URL into Google Reader. Again, The Independent
offers partial feeds with a headline teaser to lure you to the main
site.</p>

<h3>The Guardian</h3>

<p>As Modern Life reported, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/">The Guardian</a> is
the longest established and arguably most successful (in terms of the
number of online subscribers) of the UK &#8216;quality&#8217; press. Automatic feeds
are available from each section and the normal range of devices
(phone/PDA) are supported with news alerts (free) and a digital edition
(softcopy version of the print edition available for paid subscription).</p>

<p>Mini-newspapers are also available for free download in PDF format. I
presume this is for transfer to a phone/PDA to read on the train.
Howver, I think I would rather shell out for the print edition rather
than waste 12 minutes and miss the 07:58 but this is a different format
from the competition.</p>

<p>Interestingly, like the <a href="http://scobleizer.com/2007/02/22/why-do-a-reader-only-for-one-publication-adobe-vs-microsoft-for-developers/">New York
Times</a>,
The Guardian also offers its own newsreader,
<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/newspoint/">Newspoint</a>, which seems to defeat
the point of RSS but may be helpful for newcomers (or confused readers
fed up with trying to subscribe to The Independent).</p>
