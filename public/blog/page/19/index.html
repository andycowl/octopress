  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last night, I flew home to London from Hamburg, near Germany. The flight
was punctual and uneventful enough apart from the fact I was sitting
next to a blind man.</p>

<p>When the seat belts sign extinguished, he got his laptop out, booted up
and started typing into a completely black screen. So, I assumed he must
be blind and using a braille keyboard.</p>

<p>However, this gentleman wasn&#8217;t blind. He had been reading &#8216;High Life&#8217;
while we taxied onto the runway. Oh and he also had a
<a href="http://nbrightside.com/blog/2005/10/22/british-mentality">complimentary</a>
copy of the Financial Times.</p>

<p>There was only one conclusion - this was a security measure to stop
inquisitive neighbours peeping at his screen and reading confidential
documents and email correspondence.</p>

<p>This could only mean one thing - the gentleman worked for a Government
agency, probably MI6 or was the CEO of a FTSE100 company.</p>

<p>Although it killed my last three cats, two hamsters and seventeen
tropical fish, curiosity got the better of me and I painstakingly
reverse engineered all of my neighbour&#8217;s typing by analysing his actual
keystrokes in real-time.</p>

<p>Here is the exclusive transcript&#8230;</p>

<blockquote><p>To: Sebastian Browning (VP marketing)\
 Cc: UK Marketing\
 Subject: logistics for Partner Golf day\</p>

<p>Due to the current &#8216;difficult and challenging times&#8217;, the Partner Golf
day at The Old Course, St Andrews has been cancelled. However, as I
know a lot of you had customers booked and after my pledge to do
&#8216;anything it takes&#8217;, I am delighted to tell you an alternative, lower
cost venue has been found.</p>

<p>We will now meet at Solihull municipal Crazy Golf course at 2pm on
Friday 28 November. Looking forward to meeting you and your customers.
Alan will send handicaps and pairings out next week.</p></blockquote>

<p>There now followed a 5 minute lull - no typing - just a frenzy of
trackerball activity punctuated by various muttered expletives. The most
likely cause was the poor individual trying to resize a picture within a
Microsoft Word document. Then back to the 782 messages lying in &#8216;Inbox&#8217;.</p>

<blockquote><p>To: Bernard Barnstormworth (Director Fins)\
 Subject: status on Megabank opportunity\
Megabank is dead. The client was expecting to be hosted at The
Emirates to see Arsenal versus Manchester United followed by dinner at
The Ivy. What they got was a mini-bus to Leyton Orient against
Hartlepool and some cockles and mussels at half-time. The CEO just
called me to say the deal is off.</p></blockquote>

<p>Another pause for thought to consume a cheese sandwich and a glass of
water.</p>

<blockquote><p>To: Hannah Brown (IT security)\
 Subject: privacy and security\
Hannah - As per your recent memo, my two hard disks are now fully
encrypted and I have affixed the privacy screen overlay to my laptop.
I must say it is absolutely fantastic to be able to work without
idiots gawping at my screen, trying to read my email and watching me
visit those dodgy Web sites.</p>

<p>PS. Please can you order me a new 4GB USB memory stick ? I can&#8217;t find
it anywhere. Must have lost it in Hamburg.</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For reasons that are too long and tedious to recount here, I have had
cause to rebuild my Lenovo T61 laptop many times over the last month,
using a bewildering range of operating systems, Linux distributions,
live CD&#8217;s and dual boot configurations.</p>

<p>During this time, <a href="http://gparted.sourceforge.net/">gparted</a> and an
external USB 500GB disk drive have become very close and reliable
friends. In fact, I have only lost data once and, inevitably, that was
due to my own stupidity.</p>

<p>Here are the invaluable Firefox plugins that I always install first:
-   <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/201">DownloadThemAll!</a></p>

<pre><code>- download manager featuring multi-threaded, lightning fast,
resumable downloads.
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/7369">is.gd</a> - URL
shortener.</li>
<li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2792">Diigo</a> - Great
bookmarking service.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.google.com/notebook/download">Google Notebook</a> - Useful

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Occasionally, I commute into London on South West Trains. I normally
listen to music or podcasts during the half hour commute into Waterloo.</p>

<p>Whenever I buy a ticket at the station, I always pause the music and
remove my earphones. This is for two reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>I need to be able to communicate with the person to purchase my
ticket.</li>
<li>People behind me in the queue may not want to hear &#8216;Serve the
Servants&#8217; by Nirvana.</li>
</ol>


<p>Last Monday morning, I joined a short queue to buy my Travelcard and
removed my earphones as usual.</p>

<p>The lady immediately in front of me was talking on a mobile phone and
moved forward to the ticket booth. Much to my surprise, she continued
her obviously unimportant conversation with a friend while conducting
the entire transaction.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;Yeah so then we went on to the Slug - weekly Travelcard, zones 1-5 -
No, no, he wasn&#8217;t there - he was drinking in Putney with his mates&#8230;&#8217;
&#8216;&pound;41.40 please.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;&#8230;but we met them later - Sorry - what did you say - someone just
interrupted me - Anyway, what about tonight ?</p>

<p>&#8216;Please can you enter your PIN ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Sorry - she just interrupted me again - What ? - there you go - Yeah
- well I&#8217;ll get back about half-six - then we can go for a drink and
then get - sorry what - oh my ticket.&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>I then approached the ticket desk, waited for the young lady to move out
of earshot and said:</p>

<p>&#8216;Honestly, I can&#8217;t believe what she just did. I think that is incredibly
rude and disrespectful.&#8217;</p>

<p>The lady smiled ruefully: &#8216;Yes. We used to have a polite notice but most
people simply ignored it.&#8217;</p>

<p>So, if and when <a href="http://www.ewows.net/about/">Jonathan Beckett</a> secures
the domain name
&#8217;<a href="http://www.ewows.net/2008/10/29/the-ignorati/">ignorati.com</a>&#8217;, I&#8217;ll be
an avid reader.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Surrey Traffic Police should run a recruitment campaign with the tagline</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;Join Surrey Traffic Police and see the world.&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>This would appeal to young men who fancy the glamour and travel
traditionally associated with the Armed Forces but are slightly wary of
losing their lives in Iraq or Afghanistan.</p>

<p>In August, I hired a car mid-way through my holiday in Venice to drive
to the foot of the Dolomite mountains and also took the opportunity to
visit Lake Garda.</p>

<p>So that explains why, on the hot, sunny, blissfully lazy afternoon of
Sunday 10th August, I was driving slowly through the lovely small
Italian town of Spresiano.</p>

<p>To save money and increase fuel economy, the Brightside family were
crammed in to a rather underpowered Fiat Panda as we explored churches
and Italian villages using the delightfully, quiet country roads.</p>

<p>Imagine my surprise, as I left the sleepy town heading for Treviso, I
was flagged over by two Carabinieri (not Italian police - Carabinieri)
who were obviously not merely equipped with radar guns but real guns.</p>

<p>The official approached my window and made a polite request in
rapid-fire Italian. I looked blank and replied &#8216;Sorry - Inglese - do you
want to see my driving licence and documents ?&#8217;
He looked perplexed and a little disappointed: &#8216;Oh so you are English,
yes ?. What are you doing here ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;We&#8217;re on holiday and hired a car to come to see your beautiful
mountains and Lake Garda&#8217;. I pointed at my family who were listening to
iPods, reviewing sunburn and consulting the map studiously in an effort
to reinforce my argument.</p>

<p>I got out of the car and opened the boot to locate the hire car
documents and dig out my driving licence. A pile of wet towels, a
rucksack, some beach shells and a large bottle of Fanta Orange fell out.
The military official looked dismissively at me.</p>

<p>&#8216;So - why are you having a pink driving licence ?&#8217;</p>

<p>A multitude of witty answers immediately sprang to mind but I contented
myself with &#8216;Well - that&#8217;s what the English Govermnment gave me.&#8217;</p>

<p>His colleague, irritated and curious about the delay on a routine
traffic stop, wandered over and the mood lightened. &#8216;Oh you are coming
from London. I have been to London in 2005 - do you know Li-ches-ter
Square ?&#8217; followed by &#8216;I have always wanted to visit Ed-een-burro&#8217;.</p>

<p>Finally, their checks complete, I was free to continue my journey. I
summoned up the courage and whispered: &#8216;Excuse me but was I travelling
too fast ?&#8217;.</p>

<p>The two Carabinieri looked at each other and said &#8216;Oh no - no problem -
it is just a routine stop. This is normal in Italia.&#8217;</p>

<p>And then, in a scene reminiscent of the Great Escape where Gordon
Jackson has his papers checked by the Gestapo and the German officer
quietly says &#8216;Good Luck&#8217; as he goes to board the bus to which Jackson
replies &#8216;Thanks&#8217;, the Italian policeman muttered &#8216;See you in London&#8217;.</p>

<p>This closing comment perplexed me and I assumed I had misheard the
Italian accent. That was until today when I received another
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/12/22/seasons-greetings/">letter</a>
from my friends at Surrey Traffic Police. The letter formally notified
me that, on 23 October 2008, 3 further points have now been cleared from
my driving licence (leaving an outstanding total of just 3).</p>

<p>Chillingly, the official letter closed with:</p>

<blockquote><p>PS. Hope you all enjoyed your holiday in Venice</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Although I will always associate Paul Ince with the phrase &#8216;big time
Charlie&#8217;, I do think the Blackburn manager talks a lot of sense.</p>

<p>In particular, I think he was correct in his
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/r/rangers/7689580.stm">assessment</a>
of Celtic&#8217;s display at Old Trafford on Wednesday night in the Champions
League. Apart from a few early promising moments, I think the gulf
between the two sides was embarrassing.</p>

<p>In fact, when I first tuned in to watch the game, initially I thought I
had got the dates mixed up and I was watching United playing Norwich
City in the Carling Cup.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>18 months ago, I
<a href="http://nbrightside.com/blog/2007/02/27/uk-broadsheets-narrow-view-of-syndication">reviewed</a>
the online editions of the leading UK newspapers and the various
syndication options.</p>

<p>At that time, all the newspapers only offered partial text feeds which,
in my opinion, is understandable but
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/05/26/partial-versus-full-fe/">unsatisfactory</a>.</p>

<p>So I was pleasantly surprised to read in
<a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/the_guardian_full_text_rss.php">ReadWriteWeb</a>
that The Guardian has broken ranks and now
<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/insideguardian/2008/oct/22/full-fat-rss-feed-upgrade">offers</a>
full text RSS feeds. It will be interesting to see whether this
increases subscribers for The Guardian and whether the competition will
be persuaded to follow suit.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>From the desk of Mr. Ashley. Good day. Private message to you.</p>

<p>I know you don&#8217;t mind me contacting you by this means since we have not
met before this time. My name is Lord King Glorious Michael &#8216;Haway the
Lads&#8217; Ashley.</p>

<p>Recently, my Uncle&#8217;s (Sir Robert Robson of Gateshead) will was read and
to our joy and relief, he has kept the sum of $8 milion USD in trust for
the upkeep of the beloved Newcastle Footballing Club.</p>

<p>With divine intervention, we have already secured the assistance of the
Cockney Mafia and I humbly seek your financial aid to restore Newcastle
Barcodes FC to their rightful place (in the Championship).</p>

<p>However, you must act fast to take advantage of this opportunity. In the
last week, we have already hired a leading, proven, experienced,
respected manager to lead the team. His name is Joseph (&#8216;Kinnell&#8217;)
Kinnear and he has already made great strides in making friends with the
local news media in order to obtain additional funding.</p>

<p>Newcastle Footballing Club already has some world class international
footballing stars who are household names (in Geordie households) -
England centre-forward Saint Michael Owen of Chester, Clown Prince Danny
Guthrie and undoubtedly you will have a poster of your countryman, Shola
Amoeba, on your bedroom wall.</p>

<p>Newcastle Racing Club Santander are a massive football club - in fact,
every single English person who lives in Newcastle will tell you that
Nudecastle are a sleeping giant. Newcastle play in a superb stadium - St
Jimmy Five Bellies Park - which has an unbelievable capacity of 55,000
people. Once, back in 1996, when we were chasing the Premiership title,
under the majestic leadership of the Messiah King Kevin of Scunthorpe,
we even managed to fill it for the visit of Manchester United.</p>

<p>Please wire $24.6 million dollars immediately into account 7649820 -
sort code 23-65-91 and we will proceed with Phase 2. This will require
the appointment of a fifth interim manager - the self-appointed Royal
Holiness Alan Shearer of Durham - to lift the club from the relegation
places and a subsequent under the counter payment to hire the chosen one
- a man appointed by God and equipped to save Newcastle - his name is
the Special One and will be joining us in June 2009 once the Cockney
Mafia has completed dealings with their Italian counterparts.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1>Introduction</h1>

<p><a href="http://www.habariproject.org/en/">Habari</a> is a blogging platform,
created back in January 2007 and in the subsequent 18 months, the
tags:</p>

<pre><code>- uncategorised
</code></pre>

<p>software has matured and version 0.5.1 was recently
<a href="http://www.habariproject.org/en/0-5-1-released">released</a>.</p>

<p>Originally, I downloaded and experimented with Habari late in 2007 but
it wasn&#8217;t until February 2008 that I finally took the plunge and
<a href="http://nbrightside.com/blog/2008/02/13/now-on-habari">migrated</a> my blog
from WordPress.</p>

<h1>Installation</h1>

<p>Habari requires PHP 5.2 (or higher) and PHP Data Objects (PDO). If your
hosting company can&#8217;t meet these requirements, think about switching to
one that can. Habari also supports multiple database types:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Installation is very simple. You simply create the appropriate database,
enter the details of the database configuration together with the user
credentials for the administration account.</p>

<hr />

<p>  <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/CKrel8WFknsg5BkIXVH5Ow"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/nbrightside/SNudADE5w7I/AAAAAAAAAvU/pu2msrsNHaI/s400/Habari-Install-mySql.PNG" alt="image" /></a></p>

<hr />

<p>Hit &#8216;Submit&#8217; and you&#8217;re finished.</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/3pz7dbNRrMQoZLGX9rSdVQ"><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/nbrightside/SNudf2_3GKI/AAAAAAAAAwU/4ag4nyGpyk8/s400/Habari-Success.PNG" alt="image" /></a></p>

<h1>The Habari interface</h1>

<p>Habari has a single menu structure and the main dashboard is fully
configurable. For example, if you don&#8217;t want to see &#8216;Latest Log
Activity&#8217; simply remove that tab. You can also drag and drop elements to
position the various elements of the dashboard to suit yourself.</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/1psP1BfWBg_wLS9LRy69Fw"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/nbrightside/SNuc_kAhJ4I/AAAAAAAAAvE/RF8ImW-HFKw/s400/Habari-dashboard.PNG" alt="image" /></a>
Obviously, bloggers spend most of their time composing posts and the
Habari article editor is beautifully simple, clean and uncluttered.
<a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/rRwx67oluzaANNownn69FQ"><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/nbrightside/SNuc_4w9GAI/AAAAAAAAAvM/njYEV5rCk9g/s400/Habari-Editor.PNG" alt="image" /></a>
There are two separate tabs which expand to reveal the basic
configuration options (timestamp, slug, comments) and another to define
and add tags to the newly created post.</p>

<p>Searching for content in Habari is also refreshingly different. There is
a timeline which can be dragged and resized, for example to focus on all
posts made during 2007, supplemented by conventional searching.</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/Uip6f-befSyePgUsODagLQ"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/nbrightside/SNyoWrRYNvI/AAAAAAAAAyM/OTqwauv5zMM/s400/Timeline.PNG" alt="image" /></a></p>

<h1>Migration</h1>

<p>Importers exist to import WordPress and Serendipity data into Habari.
There is no native support for the (non standard) WXR format favoured by
WordPress.com but staging the content into a local WordPress
installation and then into Habari is possible.</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/EUqZYHwOy13P8Ws3hSBsnA"><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/nbrightside/SNudgN6ocwI/AAAAAAAAAws/uDSaCZhHu7k/s400/Habari-WP-Import.PNG" alt="image" /></a>
The WordPress importer is fast and robust. I imported over 700 posts and
1,000 comments without errors in less than 2 minutes. In fact, it was so
fast, I had to double-check that the import had actually worked ! All my
existing WordPress categories were correctly converted to tags.</p>

<h1>Themes</h1>

<p>Habari is still a relatively young project (albeit growing rapidly) so
the number of themes available for Habari isn&#8217;t as wide ranging as, say
Wordpress. Nor is there a browsable theme directory. However, there is
an increasing number of attractive, well designed themes
<a href="http://wiki.habariproject.org/en/Available_Themes">available</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/KR_A5-NqpFkUHa0h9TFRrw"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/nbrightside/SNudgKxFahI/AAAAAAAAAwc/8XNi5qBhea8/s400/Habari-Themes.PNG" alt="image" /></a></p>

<h1>Plugins</h1>

<p>Plugins are installed by uploading the to server and unpacking in the
&#8216;/user/plugins&#8217; directory. Then the plugin is then activated and
configured from the Administration-Plugins screen.</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/fvpCWCoiOrwKvceZXBRZew"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/nbrightside/SNudOsaZroI/AAAAAAAAAwE/XF2f1-EoSYk/s400/Habari-Plugins.PNG" alt="image" /></a>
Like themes, the number of
<a href="http://trac.habariproject.org/habari-extras/browser/plugins">plugins</a>
available for Habari is nowhere near as vast (or overwhelming) as other
longer established blogging platforms. You can review the list of
plugins in the Habari-extras
<a href="http://trac.habariproject.org/habari-extras/browser/plugins">repository</a>.</p>

<p>However, the key functionality that most bloggers want and need are all
supported. Hardly surprisingly, as all the Habari developers eat their
own dog food and maintain Habari powered blogs.</p>

<ul>
<li>metaWeblog - enable blogging clients like ScribeFire</li>
<li>Contact form</li>
<li>Google Analytics</li>
<li>Adsense</li>
<li>Feedburner</li>
<li>Scheduled posts</li>
<li>LiveHelp - easy access to IRC embedded in Habari</li>
<li>Defensio - superior anti-spam solution</li>
<li>Media silos for Flickr, Viddler and YouTube</li>
<li>Sitemaps</li>
<li>Podcast</li>
<li>Related Posts</li>
<li>Plugins to integrate Diigo, Jaiku, Twitter into your blog</li>
</ul>


<p>There are also a couple of WYSIWYG editors to choose from (NicEdit,
jwysiwyg) although I now use the excellent MarkUp plugin which adds
shortcuts for common tags to the article editor but leaves you in full
control of the HTML.</p>

<h1>Documentation</h1>

<p>The Habari documentation is available in Wiki format. The release
documentation is also distilled into TiddlyWiki and is included with the
Habari distribution. This is useful if you are working in a disconnected
environment.</p>

<p><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/nbrightside/SNudOFmharI/AAAAAAAAAv0/nE0hTNo-Kf4/s400/Habari-Manual.PNG" alt="image" /></p>

<h1>Why is Habari different ?</h1>

<p>People often ask &#8216;What makes Habari better than XYZ ?&#8217; And, of course,
that&#8217;s hard to answer and also very subjective. I always reply; &#8216;Habari
isn&#8217;t better - it&#8217;s just different&#8217;.</p>

<p>Having used the software for six months now, these are a few of the
reasons I like Habari:
-   Ease of use.
-   Admin interface.
-   Media silos.
-   Actively developed.
-   The &#8216;community&#8217;.
-   The article editor.
-   Ease of use
-   Small, active and responsive developer community.
-   The automatic schema upgrade process works seamlessly.
-   The LiveHelp plugin.
-   Proper timezone support built into core.
-   Minor edits - ability to fix typos without updating the Atom feed.
-   Ease of use.</p>

<p>And finally, and perhaps most importantly - Habari is fun - the project
is developing rapidly. It&#8217;s fun to run the latest SVN code. It&#8217;s fun to
review the latest set of changes in trac. It&#8217;s exciting to type &#8216;svn
update&#8217;. It&#8217;s fun to lurk in the IRC channel and eavesdrop on developer
discussions.</p>

<p>Of course, there are some areas of functionality (access control lists)
that are incomplete or &#8216;planned&#8217; but I can honestly say that the absence
of the following features doesn&#8217;t really affect my normal, daily use of
Habari.</p>

<ul>
<li>No Fantastico or SimpleScripts installations available.</li>
<li>No centralised theme or plugin repository.</li>
<li>No widget support - you currently have to modify PHP templates to
modify your sidebar.</li>
<li>No automatic upgrade of core software, themes or plugins.</li>
<li>Tags are supported but not categories.</li>
<li>The plugin configuration forms are pretty basic.</li>
<li>Documentation for plugins is sparse.</li>
</ul>


<h1>Community</h1>

<p>The word &#8216;community&#8217; is used a lot in the Habari community. I think it&#8217;s
because those guys like recursion. Before I got involved, I was fairly
sceptical to be honest. However, having lurked, watched from the
sidelines and occasionally contributed, I can say that there is a
genuine sense of community on the Habari project. Contributions from
anyone and everyone are positively welcomed and encouraged. There&#8217;s a
couple of mailing lists, an IRC channel, a Wiki and subversion
repository.</p>

<p>As just one example, I was staggered when I was initially playing with
Habari and mentioned in passing that the lack of a WYSIWYG editor was an
issue. Within 12 hours, Michael Harris had provided me with a TinyMCE
plugin !</p>

<p>Although I&#8217;m not a expert Web developer - I can&#8217;t spell PHP or OO - I
must say, that everyone has been very helpful. There is no elitist
developer clique - Habari is very transparent and open and everyone&#8217;s
contribution (no matter how seemingly small) is welcomed.</p>

<p>Once awake, Habari developers can also move fast. For example,
yesterday, the Cisco Web site was hacked and every single occurrence of
the letter &#8216;t&#8217; was lost. By the end of the day, Habari had a hilarious
plugin that also filtered every single &#8216;t&#8217; from a Habari blog.</p>

<h1>Summary</h1>

<p>Don&#8217;t take my word for it. Why not download Habari and try it for
yourself ? You might be surprised.</p>
