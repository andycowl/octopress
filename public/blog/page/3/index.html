  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://baskersworld.wordpress.com/about/">Sarah Baskerville</a> is a
civil servant who works for the Department of Transport in London.</p>

<p>Back in November, there was a minor storm in a teacup when the Daily
Mail caught Sarah caught posting the shocking revelation to Twitter
that she &#8216;Had a hangover&#8217; whilst at work. In addition, she
occasionally had the temerity to dare to question Government policy.</p>

<p>Unless you are a Daily Mail reader, none of this is very newsworthy. I
suspect the vast majority of people with a Twitter account have posted
<a href="http://nbrightside.com/blog/2008/04/29/a-brief-history-of-inane-drivel">inane
drivel</a>
along the lines of &#8216;At work. Hungover. Need coffee&#8217;.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s clear from reading her <a href="http://baskersworld.wordpress.com/">blog</a>
that Sarah Baskerville is an intelligent, educated,
<a href="http://uk.linkedin.com/in/sarahbaskerville">experienced</a> lady who
cares about her job and is passionate about improving things. Why -
she even gave up her own time on a Sunday to attend a work related
<a href="http://baskersworld.wordpress.com/2010/12/08/once-more-unto-the-breach-dear-friends-linkedgov/">conference</a>
so I certainly don&#8217;t begrudge her tweeting from her workplace. There,
but for the grace of God, and all that.</p>

<p>Nor do I really care that she dares to criticise Government policy -
I&#8217;d rather that than some mindless, faceless drone implementing
Government policy unquestioningly - or that she admits she is looking
forward to going home after a hard day. Who doesn&#8217;t ?</p>

<p>What I find interesting about this story is the fact that Sarah
Baskerville then proceeded to lodge two
<a href="http://www.pcc.org.uk/news/index.html?article=NjkzNQ==">complaints</a>
with the Press Complaints Commission (PCC) about the Independent on
Sunday&#8217;s (not the Daily Mail) subsequent
<a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/the-hounding-of-baskerville-2133666.html">coverage</a>
of a small selection of Sarah&#8217;s <a href="http://twitter.com/Baskers">postings</a>
on Twitter.</p>

<p>In her complaint, Baskerville claimed that she had a &#8216;reasonable
expectation that my [Twitter] messages&#8230;would be published only to my
followers&#8217;.</p>

<p>As someone active in multiple social networks (Baskerville&#8217;s Web site
<a href="http://baskers.net/">portal</a> lists a total of 20 social networks), it
is simply inconceivable that she didn&#8217;t know how the Twitter service
worked and a Tweet was immediately posted and visible on a public Web
site on the Internet.</p>

<p>Baskerville has even written an excellent
<a href="http://baskersworld.wordpress.com/some-thoughts/">article</a> about the
use of social netwoking tools in Government and how they could be used
to engage more openly with the public so she clearly understands how
Twitter et al function and how these services disseminate information
quickly to a wide audience.</p>

<p>Sarah Baskerville isn&#8217;t some 16 year old school leaver working in
Greggs bakery posting on Facebook that &#8216;Mr. Grimsdyke told me off for
being late again. I hate that man&#8217; and then being surprised when she
subsequently receives a complimentary &#8216;steak bake&#8217; together with her
P45.</p>

<p>If Sarah Baskerville truly wanted her messages to be visible to her
Followers, she could have easily have achieved this using a private
Twitter feed but I suspect she simply didn&#8217;t bother because she
thought no-one was listening.</p>

<p>Of course, not many people click through to read the small print when
they rush over to sign up on Twitter to follow Jonathan Ross. However,
maybe Sarah should take time to read the full version of the Twitter
<a href="https://twitter.com/tos">Terms of Service</a></p>

<blockquote><p>The Content you submit, post, or display will be able to be viewed
by other users of the Services and through third party services and
websites (go to the > account settings page to control who sees your
Content).</p></blockquote>

<p>The same warning is even summarised in a top tip - &#8216;What you say on
Twitter may be viewed all around the world instantly&#8217; which, for most
people, is exactly the point.</p>

<p>I suspect Sarah Baskerville was fully aware of this possibility but
didn&#8217;t bother as she freely admits she simply didn&#8217;t expect to be
&#8216;targeted&#8217; (her words) by the Daily Mail and subsequently by the
Independent on Sunday.</p>

<p>The original news story broke in November and it appears Sarah
Baskerville still has her job and I sincerely hope she doesn&#8217;t get
dismissed over this episode.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the PCC
<a href="http://www.pcc.org.uk/news/index.html?article=NjkzNQ==">rejected</a>
both of Baskerville&#8217;s complaints agreeing with the Independent&#8217;s
damning assertion:</p>

<blockquote><p>The complainant was not, said the newspaper, &#8220;someone who for some
reason was able to use the technology but unable to realise the
consequences of making her life so public.</p></blockquote>

<p>However, I also suspect Sarah Baskerville lodged her complaint with
the PCC in order to prolong her 15 minutes of fame, thinking that she
was striking a hammer blow for freedom on behalf of all individual
bloggers and workplace tweeters everywhere. Winning her case would
result in media coverage, worldwide gratitude and acclaim and somehow
make a name for herself.</p>

<p>She certainly succeeded in doing that. The name is &#8216;idiot&#8217;.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Dear Fat Controller</p>

<p>Occasionally, I use South West Trains to commute from my home in sunny
Norbiton into the City of London. However before you say anything,
don&#8217;t worry, I am not a merchant banker despite what my friends say.</p>

<p>Today, in an attempt to secure a seat, I delayed my departure slightly
and caught the legendary 08:36 service from Norbiton. Unfortunately, I
narrowly missed a highly prized seat when a rather forceful gentleman,
who boarded after me, miraculously managed to reach the last vacant
seat 0.74 seconds before me. Bastard.</p>

<p>According to the official South West Trains timetable, which is
proudly pinned up in my downstairs lavatory, this service that leaves
at 08:36 should take 30 minutes, precisely, arriving at its final
destination at 09:06.</p>

<p>Today&#8217;s journey left on time and arrived at Waterloo at 09:14 - a mere
8 minutes late. This isn&#8217;t 5% late. This isn&#8217;t 10% late. This isn&#8217;t
20% late. This delay of 8 minutes on a 30 minute journey represents a
delay of 26.66667%.</p>

<p>Still, I guess I should be grateful that the cost of my weekly
TravelCard (Zones 1-5) has only increased by a paltry 6.81% from
&pound;44 to &pound;47 from January 1. If the Financial Controller
from South West Trains saw these metrics, he may well (incorrectly)
conclude that if the trains run 26% late, then the cost of the ticket
should rise by the corresponding percentage.</p>

<p>During our extended, tedious, never ending journey where we frequently
came to a grinding halt outside a station or lingered for four thought
provoking minutes adjacent to that cemetery near Clapham Junction, I
am pleased to report that we were afforded the courtesy of the
occasional helpful announcement from the guard: &#8216;Ladies and
gentlemen. We apologise for the short delay but we are being held at a
red signal. We hope to be underway again shortly&#8217;.</p>

<p>The thing is - this delay isn&#8217;t a one-off. This isn&#8217;t a delay caused
by the inclement weather we experienced before Christmas. This sort of
delay is now routine.</p>

<p>In fact, these delays are so routine that people don&#8217;t even moan any
more. People just shrug their shoulders, scurry along the platform
onto the tube network and accept this poor service as the norm.</p>

<p>Thankfully, I don&#8217;t have an annual season ticket and I am not
condemned to using South West Trains every single working day. I am an
occasional commuter but whenever I do use the service, it invariably
arrives late. Once it was just 12 seconds late - if only the driver
hadn&#8217;t lingered at Wimbledon reading the football reports in &#8216;The
Mirror&#8217;.</p>

<p>Now, I guess it would be an interesting exercise to keep detailed
metrics for all my journeys in order to support this bold claim with
statistical evidence that could then form the basis of a compensation
claim.</p>

<p>However, I refuse to do this for two reasons; firstly I simply can&#8217;t
be arsed and secondly that way lies danger and obsessive compulsive
train-spotter disorder (OCTSD). Before you know it, I would be stood,
wearing an anorak, on a wet and windy, desolate platform 11 at Clapham
Junction late at night holding a video camera, desperately trying to
capture the rare &#8216;337919&#8217; engine that powers the Gatwick Express.</p>

<p>Obviously, I don&#8217;t want to waste your time and money by forcing you to
issue a stock response to a yet another stock complaint from
&#8216;Mr. Angry Commuter from Redhill&#8217; so here&#8217;s my constructive suggestion
in order to significantly improve the service between Norbiton and
Waterloo.</p>

<p>Simply increase the planned duration of all journeys between Norbiton
and Waterloo to 45 minutes. Currently some journeys are scheduled to
take 28 minutes while others are supposed to take 30 minutes. This
inconsistency needs to be addressed.</p>

<p>Altering the timetable in this way will help ensure that <strong>all</strong>
journeys arrive not just on schedule but ahead of schedule as in
early.</p>

<p>This seemingly minor change will have multiple benefits; commuters
will disembark, happy and smiling, consulting their watches and
exclaiming &#8216;8 minutes early. Again. How fantastic. What a marvellous
service. I really must email South West Trains congratulating them on
this sustained improvement in the service&#8217;.</p>

<p>Following this modest increase in the estimated journey times,
customer complaints will rapidly fall to zero. This means you can sack
all the people in the customer service centre with a corresponding
beneficial effect to the very important &#8216;bottom line&#8217;.</p>

<p>Finally, and perhaps most importantly, South West Trains will meet all
their performance targets and you will be eligible for your massive
financial bonus and a well deserved promotion to &#8216;Morbidly Obese
Controller&#8217;.</p>

<p>Hopefully, you will consider this suggestion and implement it
initially on a pilot basis on the Shepperton line, If, as I am
convinced it will be, this change proves to be a success, this novel
and innovative change to make the railway timetable actually reflect
reality can be rolled out across the entire network in 2012. Just in
time for the Olympics.</p>

<p>Yours sincerely</p>

<p>Norman Brightside</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This blog and the handful of
<a href="http://nbrightside.com/blog/2010/12/22/essential-modules-your-new-drupal-7-site">modules</a>
I use has been upgraded to the final version of Drupal 7.0 which was
<a href="http://drupal.org/drupal-7.0">released</a> today.</p>

<p>I was quite pleased that I used Drupal 7 from the early beta versions
and then tracked the D7 release candidates as this gave me valuable
experience in upgrading Drupal 7 relatively quickly while preserving
my additional modules without losing all my data which always
helps. It&#8217;s worth noting that although I barely scratch the surface of
Drupal 7&#8217;s wide range of functionality, the quality, reliability and
performance of Drupal 7 was perfectly fine for this blog.</p>

<p>Personally (and rather selfishly), I hope that the formal release of
Drupal 7.0 will encourage more developers to upgrade which, in turn,
which provide impetus for more Drupal modules (and themes) to be
ported and made available for Drupal 7.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.steverubel.com/">Steve Rubel</a> sings the
<a href="http://www.steverubel.com/markdown-is-a-skill-every-modern-communicator">praises</a>
of <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> and good
old fashioned text editors.</p>

<p>I agree and for a long time have dithered over whether to write all of
my blog posts in Markdown. This makes sense as it simplifies the
syntax and theoretically should make writing content easier and
quicker. I was particularly struck by Caius Durling&#8217;s
<a href="http://caiustheory.com/view-raw-source">use</a> of Markdown on his
Habari blog and the use of the plaintext plugin to reveal the raw
Markdown.</p>

<p>However, despite experimenting with both the Markdown
<a href="https://trac.habariproject.org/habari-extras/browser/plugins/habarimarkdown?rev=746&amp;order=name">plugin</a>
for <a href="http://habariproject.org/en/">Habari</a> and later the Markdown
filter <a href="http://drupal.org/project/markdown">module</a> for Drupal, I have
actually never taken the plunge.</p>

<p>I think the subconscious reasons behind for my reluctance to bite the
bullet and fully embrace Markdown are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Knowing the subset of HTML tags I commonly use, I am finally
relatively comfortable composing posts in raw HTML.</p></li>
<li><p>Although Markdown uses a simple, easy to learn syntax (which is
rather the whole point after all), the Markdown markup would be a
slightly different syntax to learn and master.</p></li>
<li><p>I am (justifiably in my case) worried that I would constantly
produce incorrect Markdown syntax and hence generate flawed HTML so I
would be forever reviewing the generated HTML which again would be
time consuming and self-defeating. A side by side split, live screen
Markdown/HTML <a href="http://wmd-editor.com/examples/splitscreen">preview</a>
would be really useful.I have just discovered the
<a href="http://drupal.org/project/live">Live</a> module which looks like it
could be used in conjunction with the Markdown filter to create
similar functionality (but only when this module is ported to Drupal
7).</p></li>
<li><p>Sometimes I embed images from Picasweb or YouTube and I&#8217;m not sure
how these HTML embeds would work in Markdown or whether the Markdown
processor will accept raw HTML for these occasional exceptions.</p></li>
<li><p>Drupal supports different filter types on a per post basis but I
have concerns about attempting to migrate a blog containing a mixture
of HTML and Markdown posts to different blog platforms and I&#8217;m hardly
likely to convert 1,000 historic posts to Markdown. However, if the
Markdown is processed and the generated HTML is stored in the
database, this may not be a problem. Another obvious solution is
trying to curb this constant urge to tinker with the underlying
technology powering this blog but that is unlikely to happen.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Anyway, time to stop procrastinating. I have managed to write this
post in Markdown and already I like the modified, simpler syntax, so I
will endeavour to follow Steve Rubel&#8217;s advice and join the ranks of
the &#8216;modern communicators&#8217;.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Manchester, near England - Wednesday 5 January 2011</p>

<p>The footballing world was left reeling yesterday at shock news
emanating from Manchester City&#8217;s training facility at Carrington. A
local man, Frank Booth explains: &#8216;I always pass the City training
ground on my way to work so I always check out the players going
through their drills. Yesterday I was quite shocked to see all the
players smiling and laughing. I couldn&#8217;t believe my eyes so I stopped
for a closer look.</p>

<p>&#8216;The senior players appeared to be discussing the presents they had
received at Christmas. Emmanuel Adebayor was sporting a lovely Inter
Milan shirt and Carlos Tevez was passing around some Braun hair
straighteners. All of this just two days before a crucial top of the
table clash away at Arsenal that could decide the destiny of the
league title and end 35 years of hurt. The Italian manager, Mancini,
was no better and appeared to be trying to place a Christmas Angel on
top of Yaya Toure&#8217;s head using a small, portable step ladder. For a
laugh, each squad player had given Mancini an identical pale blue and
white City scarf so he was attempting to wear all 23 scarves at once.&#8217;</p>

<p>Roberto Mancini attempted to justify this unexpected outbreak of
peace, love and harmony: &#8216;At this moment, this is very normal for the
players to be relaxed and smiling. In the recent moments, we had tough
matches over Christmas so now we relax just for one of the eight daily
training sessions. There is no problem with morale in the squad in
this moment. The Inter Milan shirt for Adebayor is not a problem. In
fact, that was, how you say, my Secret Santa gift for him&#8217;.</p>

<p>In an exclusive interview, Chief Executive Garry Cook attempted to
give a managerial spin on this remarkable turn of events: &#8216;It is
absolutely ludicrous and completely untrue for amateur journalists
from tabloid newspapers to print these despicable lies just before a
crucial match. There is no suggestion whatsoever of any harmony within
the club - either on the training ground, in the dressing room or on
the coach to away matches when Joe Hart, Kolo Toure and Gareth Barry
squabble over the front seat near Roberto. Why - only this morning, I
was having a chat with Carlos about the imminent arrival of Edin Dzeko
from Wolsburg. I told Tevez, that we had been forced to offer Dzeko a
basic salary &pound;375,000 per week and Carlos was moaning that this
was higher than his &pound;350,00 a week and he was going to cry and
cry and scweam and scweam until he got an improved offer of
&pound;500,000 a day&#8217;.</p>

<p>&#8216;I replied this simply wasn&#8217;t possible and anyway his annual net
income would exceed &pound;775,000 when we win the Premiership, The
Carling Cup, the Fair Play League and the Champions League this
season. Tevez didn&#8217;t take this very well and exploded with rage,
mumbling something in Spanish about City not even being in the
Champions League. He then proceeded to strangle me with his snood and
Brian Marwood had to intervene and restrain him before I was choked to
death. So, rest assured, there are still internal squabbles, player
disquiet, unrest and petty arguments in the Manchester City dressing
room and I wouldn&#8217;t have it any other way. It shows that the players
care. It shows the player are passionate. About money&#8217;.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Before Christmas, my friendly postman tried to deliver a parcel when
no-one was home. Instead of leaving the parcel propped up by the front
door to be buried under the falling snow, inviting passers-by to steal
the potentially valuable item or slinging it into our dustbin, this
time he helpfully left a note asking me to collect the package from
the local sorting office or &#8216;request a redelivery&#8217; on a subsequent
date using a form on the Royal Mail web site.</p>

<p>As I am quite lazy, I went for the latter option, and requested
redelivery for two days later. The Xmas parcel duly arrived on the
prescribed date so that was fine. Well done to the Royal Mail for
making the redelivery request option available online. Less work for
me. A little more work for them. Everyone&#8217;s happy.</p>

<p>A full 10 days later, I was a little perplexed to receive the
following email from Royal Mail. At first, I assumed it was a feedback
request to &#8216;Please rate our service&#8217; but no, it wasn&#8217;t.</p>

<blockquote><p>Subject: Redelivery response</p>

<p>If you are now in receipt of your redelivered item, thank you for
using our on-line redelivery service and please delete this email.</p></blockquote>

<p>Ah OK so I can safely delete this email message as my parcel has been
successfully redelivered but let&#8217;s read on just out of idle curiosity.</p>

<blockquote><p>Dear Sir or Madam</p>

<p>Thank you for requesting redelivery of your item.</p>

<p>Your local delivery office received your request and after searching
for your item was unable to locate it. This could be because you have
either already collected the item from the delivery office or it has
been redelivered.</p>

<p>If this is not the case may I firstly apologise for any
inconvenience you have been caused and for information on what to do
next please visit our website at www.royalmail.com or contact Customer
Services on 08457 740 740</p></blockquote>

<p>I had to read this correspondence three times before I was able to
parse the words - &#8216;Your local delivery office received your request
and after searching for your item was unable to locate it&#8217;. Eh ? But
the local delivery office did receive my request and actioned it. The
redelivery request had a number associated with it so why didn&#8217;t they
update the status with &#8216;Redelivery scheduled for &#8216;19/12&#8217; ?</p>

<p>The next sentence is also rather odd - &#8216;This could be because you have
either already collected the item from the delivery office or it has
been redelivered.&#8217; Somehow this implication of the first statement is
that this state of confusion may partially be my fault for having the
temerity to visit the local sorting office as requested to collect my
parcel. Again, it&#8217;s clear the Royal Mail has no idea what actually
happened to this parcel. For all they know, it&#8217;s sitting at the bottom
of my tall, black wheelie bin under two heavy sacks of Christmas
rubbish imminently destined for landfill.</p>

<p>However, even though the Royal Mail has no idea what happened to my
parcel, I can rest easy - &#8216;If this is not the case may I firstly
apologise for any inconvenience you have been caused and for
information on what to do next, please visit our website or contact
Customer Services on 08457 740 740&#8217;.</p>

<p>So, if my parcel hadn&#8217;t been successfully re-delivered or I hadn&#8217;t
collected it in person, this email from Royal Mail Customer Services
hardly inspires confidence that they will inform me with any degree of
certainty what to do next.</p>

<p>Curiously, I haven&#8217;t enabled the D7 core &#8216;blog&#8217; module as I don&#8217;t need
multi-user blogs. Each post is simply an &#8216;Article&#8217;.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s a common saying in Customer Relationship Management (CRM)
circles along the lines of:</p>

<blockquote><p>It takes 10,000 times more time/money/effort to acquire a new customer
than it takes to retain an existing customer.</p></blockquote>

<p>Evidence of this is commonplace; introductory offers, improved interest
rates, free Parker pen and pencil gift set and enticements for new
customers for which existing customers are ineligible.</p>

<p>Now I occasionally claim that I am writing this blog purely for me,
myself and I. What I mean by that is that I tend to write what I want
when I want and don&#8217;t feel pressured to produce content on a regular
ongoing basis. However, that&#8217;s not entirely true; if it was I could
equally well write this stream of consciousness into a A5 notebook
locked in my top drawer where no-one would ever see it.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s be honest - people are blogging to get noticed and everyone
likes feedback (even if it&#8217;s negative feedback) and it&#8217;s fantastic if,
just occasionally, someone says &#8216;God - that post about LinkedIn and
pole dancing made me laugh&#8217;.</p>

<p>A recent
<a href="http://nbrightside.com/blog/2006/06/21/the-curious-case-of-the-missing-about-page#comment-113403409">comment</a>
by Bill (which I will reproduce here) rather took me by surprise and
made me pause for thought</p>

<blockquote><p>I like your blog, but just one thing about it frustrates me - you
“tag” posts, but I can&#8217;t seem to find an index of these tags. (?) For
example, I like to read your comments on emacs - but without such an
index, I am forced to use Google to search your site.</p></blockquote>

<p>Now here was a potential customer (an interested like-minded reader or
even hopefully, that rare animal, a brand new subscriber) for my
business (my humble blog) and what was I doing to welcome him, to
encourage him, to help him find his way around my blog ? Nothing.
Absolutely nothing.</p>

<p>After giving this some thought, I decided to take prompt and decisive
action:</p>

<blockquote><p>Many thanks for popping by and bothering to leave some constructive
criticism about the lack of decent navigation options on this blog.
There&#8217;s a couple of reasons for this:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I recently moved this blog to Drupal 7 and I didn&#8217;t actually know
how to add tag clouds, archive pages, previous/next post, related
posts or search functionality.</p></li>
<li><p>In the past, I have played with all of the above on both WordPress
and Habari in an effort to keep casual readers lingering for
longer and my gut feeling was that none of these additions made a
blind bit of difference to Pages/Visit and merely cluttered up the
blog.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>However, prompted by your comment, I have now added &#8216;Tags&#8217; together
with a search box on the sidebar and an &#8216;Archives&#8217; tab allowing you to
browse by year or month.</p></blockquote>

<p>Unfortunately, I never heard from the mysterious Bill ever again. A
cautionary tale and a valuable lesson in CRM for all small-time
bloggers.</p>
