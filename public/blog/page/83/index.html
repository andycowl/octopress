  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday, I stumbled across <a href="http://www.newsvine.com/">Newsvine</a> which
is a very impressive news aggregator. Until now, I didn&#8217;t much care for
these type of sites. <a href="http://digg.com/">Digg</a> left me a little cold with
too many irrelevant, repeated articles (not to mention flame wars) and
<a href="http://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</a> hurt my eyes.</p>

<p>I currently use <a href="http://my.yahoo.com/">My Yahoo!</a> with various news
feeds configured and was starting to experiment with a similar,
personalized Google <a href="http://www.google.com/ig">portal</a> with feeds from
<a href="http://news.google.com/">Google News</a> as an alternative.</p>

<p>Newsvine is more focussed on news with feeds from Associated Press,
tagging, watchlists, personalisation, discussions and your own news
column (articles, links). The interface is well thought out, fast, easy
to use and I quickly found myself exploring many different topics of
interest.</p>

<p>Newsvine is yet another of those Web 2.0 applications currently in beta
and needs an invitation to sign up. I anticipate Newsvine supplementing
rather than replacing <a href="http://www.curiostudio.com/">GreatNews</a> as my RSS
reader (for personal and technical blogs) but it is certainly a very
impressive and interesting application.</p>

<p>I stumbled across Newsvine on this
<a href="http://print.wordpress.com/2006/02/02/newsvinecom-private-beta">blog</a>
and the author was kind enough to issue me with an invite. If he has
none left, I also have some Newsvine invites available if you are
interested in trying it out.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have been thinking (yes I do a lot of that) recently about managing my
personal calendar more effectively. Ideally, I would like a simple Web
based calendar that could also sync to my Palm.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t really like the Yahoo! <a href="http://calendar.yahoo.com/">Calendar</a>
that much even though it can sync with Outlook and the Palm. I simply
don&#8217;t enjoy looking at the Yahoo! calendar. I just think the interface
is ugly and there are distracting ads liberally scattered at the top of
the screen.</p>

<p>I am following the development of
<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/calendar/sunbird.html">Sunbird</a> with
interest but this project is still in development and I think Sunbird
only runs locally.</p>

<p>I have an outstanding, low priority ToDo to evaluate <a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com/">Remember The
Milk</a> but keep forgetting.</p>

<p>So, I was interested to read <a href="http://photomatt.net/">Matt Mullenweg</a>
speaking in glowing <a href="http://photomatt.net/2006/02/02/30-boxes/">terms</a>
about the calendar functionality from <a href="http://www.30boxes.com/">30
Boxes</a> rapidly followed by similar sentiments
from
<a href="http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/2006/02/03/calendaring-heats-up">Scobleizer</a>.</p>

<p>Mental note. Forego &#8216;Songs of Praise&#8217; for just one week and remember to
sign up at <a href="http://www.30boxes.com/">30 Boxes</a> on Sunday 5 February when
it enters public beta.</p>

<p>In fact, add it to your calendar with an SMS alert so you don&#8217;t forget.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I wanted to find UK related blogs written by people in the UK as most
blog indexes and search engines naturally tend to be heavily weighted
towards the US.</p>

<p>Initially, I searched on <a href="http://technorati.com/">Technorati</a> for &#8216;UK&#8217;
tags. However, this included lots of photo blogs from tourists visiting
London on whale watching holidays and UK &#8216;political&#8217; news (yawn).</p>

<p>Then I came across <a href="http://www.britblog.com/">britblog.com</a> which is an
growing index of UK based blogs which includes blogs listed by region
and category in addition to recently added and popular blogs.</p>

<p>Britblog also has an interesting
<a href="http://www.britblog.com/directory/map.php">map</a> displaying the
distribution of blogs across the UK.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Good news. A kind, thoughtful, considerate colleague noticed my
unattended Palm and placed it in a locked drawer for safe keeping.
Unusually, for such a kind, thoughtful and considerate person, he
omitted to send me a note telling me.</p>

<p>Bad news. I will be writing my own Christmas cards this year.</p>

<p>The planned filming of the reconstruction next Wednesday, to be
broadcast on this month&#8217;s edition of BBC Crimewatch, has now been
cancelled.</p>

<p>Many thanks to all for your messages of support during this testing
time.</p>

<p>PS. Sincere apologies to any recipients of those awful poison pen
letters.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A few years ago, I worked for a small internet company and was a
successful dot com millionaire. Then the confounded Italians went and
devalued the Lira.</p>

<p>We spent (wasted) lots of time interviewing Oracle developers.
Interviewing was time consuming and we had a fairly rapid turnover of
people with varying technical abilities and personality disorders.</p>

<p>After a while, we decided to set a short technical test in an effort to
save time and improve the quality of the technical people we hired.</p>

<p>The test was a trivial piece of PL/SQL. Count all the rows in all the
tables in a specified schema. The consequences of introducing of this
test were very revealing.</p>

<p>Some candidates (with years of Oracle and PL/SQL experience) flatly
refused to take the test at all - &#8216;the agent didn&#8217;t say anything about a
technical test&#8217;.? Some candidates asked if they could have access to our
embryonic Oracle technical library (a couple of O&#8217;Reilly books). Some
candidates asked it they could use their own technical books for
reference. We flatly refused.</p>

<p>It was interesting to see whether people elected for Linux/vi or
Windows/notepad.</p>

<p>It was interesting to see whether people could deliver under pressure.</p>

<p>It was interesting to see whether people asked questions.</p>

<p>It was interesting to see whether people actually compiled and executed
the code. Some candidates thought, incorrectly, that the test was purely
to &#8216;write the code&#8217;.</p>

<p>It was interesting to see whether people visited
&#8216;http://tahiti.oracle.com/&#8217;. We said you couldn&#8217;t use books. However, we
didn&#8217;t say you couldn&#8217;t use the internet.</p>

<p>It was interesting to see whether people commented a trivial procedure.</p>

<p>It was interesting to see whether people counted the rows or checked for
the presence of recent statistics first.</p>

<p>It was interesting to see whether people used native, dynamic SQL or
tortured themselves with DBMS_SQL.</p>

<p>It was interesting to see whether people favoured SQL*Plus, Pro*C,
PL/SQL or Perl/DBI.</p>

<p>The standard of candidates improved. If the technical test was
unsatisfactory, we skipped the interview formalities to save time
(theirs and ours).</p>

<p>One outstanding candidate delivered an excellent test. Perfect,
commented PL/SQL. He even included a file header with CVS macros for
version control. The results were correct. He finished the assigned task
in minutes. He even used the singular if a table had &#8216;1 row&#8217;. He was an
excellent Oracle PL/SQL developer.</p>

<p>However, we didn&#8217;t hire him because there was an indefinable, intangible
concern, a nagging worry that we couldn&#8217;t articulate or put our finger
on precisely. It just didn&#8217;t feel right. Hard to explain to the agent.
Even harder to explain to him but sometimes you have to go with your
instincts.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I once sat on an interview panel. Each interviewer would briefly
summarise the strengths and weaknesses of each candidate and a decision
would be made by consensus.</p>

<p>However, for one candidate, the first interviewer simply said &#8216;No&#8217;.</p>

<p>&#8216;OK David. Thank you. John, anything to add to that ?&#8217;</p>

<p>John: &#8216;Absolutely no.&#8217;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://oracledoug.com/serendipity">Doug Burns</a> tells of an unusual
company with an unusual interviewing
<a href="http://oracledoug.com/serendipity/index.php?/archives/872-Now-Thats-What-I-Call-An-Interview!.html">technique</a>
that reminded me of some interviewing anecdotes.</p>

<p>After one year in IT, I had money in my pocket, no more studies and I
was keen, enthusiastic and motivated. Consequently, I was invited on the
&#8216;milk round&#8217; to interview prospective graduates in Scotland. Flying in
an aeroplane, staying in a posh hotel, eating food, drinking beer and
not having to pay for any of it motivated me even more.</p>

<p>So I painted a glowing picture of our company to everyone I met. Even
people I wasn&#8217;t interviewing like the hotel receptionist. I couldn&#8217;t
wait to tell the nervous undergraduates, in their ill fitting suits,
about the summer barbecque with as much free food and alcohol as you
could consume with transport laid on. Nor could I wait to tell them
about the Christmas dinner dance at a top notch London hotel with
partners invited, a high quality 5 course meal, cabaret, disco, and,
again, as much free alcohol as you wanted.</p>

<p>A year later, I was pleasantly surprised to see a familiar Scottish face
turn up for his induction after his successful application. He was also
pleased, enthusiastic and motivated. Well he was. Until, two weeks
later, I had to break the news that this years summer barbecque was
cancelled due to &#8216;budgetary constraints&#8217;. With the aid of counselling,
he managed to get over that bombshell until, three months later, I had
to break the tragic news that the Christmas dinner dance was also
cancelled due to &#8216;adverse market conditions and poor company performance
in Q3/Q4&#8217;.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A couple of messages to the kind person who accidentally took my Palm Vx
from the safety of its docking cradle. Clearly, like me, you can resist
everything but temptation.</p>

<p>\1. You can also have the mains charger, cradle, spare stylus and a
screen protector. I may even have the original box and instructions
somewhere. This will help to increase the resale value on eBay. Just
look under Brightside, N and give me a call. You will find that I am a
very understanding, forgiving type.</p>

<p>\2. Thank you. I had a nagging suspicion for a while that the Palm was
just a glorified address book. In fact, I didn&#8217;t even notice its absence
for a hour or so. Hopefully, my Palm will find more synchronisations and
love in his new home.</p>

<p>\3. Thank you. I now have a wealth of commercial and open source
software packages to evaluate and high tech gadgets to consider to help
fill this gaping void in my life.</p>

<p>\4. Finally, a proposition for you. If you send out Xmas cards to
everyone in &#8216;Personal&#8217; and &#8216;Family&#8217;, signing the cards &#8216;Happy Christmas.
All the best for 2007. Love from Norman &amp; family&#8217; and send them by 2nd
class post by 10th December, we shall call it quits and I shall take the
matter no further.</p>

<p>A couple of things struck me&#8230;</p>

<ul>
<li>Mart Rittman was one of the first Oracle bloggers (if not the first)
and uses the Movable Type platform. Not one Oracle blogger has
chosen to follow suit (ever). I wonder why.</li>
<li>Most Oracle bloggers use blogger.com which is a hosted platform but
most are not afraid to tweak their templates with varying degrees of
success. Think garish colours, think &#8216;Changing Rooms&#8217;.</li>
<li>The birth of Tom Kyte&#8217;s blog seemed to inspire a lot of Oracle
bloggers to follow suit.</li>
</ul>


<p>Anyway, thanks to all of you for the information, the technical content,
the thoughts, the ramblings and perhaps most importantly, the humour.</p>
