News</a>,
the sickening realisation slowly dawns that you might actually have been
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/05/26/partial-versus-full-fe/">mistaken</a>
and partial feeds may just have some redeeming features while full feeds
are indeed the work of the devil.</p>

<p>Full feeds potentially interrupt the flow of the river. The title alone
isn&#8217;t enough to determine whether the article merits further
consideration. Expanding the article should give you just enough to
determine whether you want to read the full text.</p>

<p>This effect is spoiled by the lengthy verbosity of the full text feed
for articles you are not interested in whatsoever.</p>

<p>The ideal compromise would be a 2 line precis of the article but <a href="http://pjsrandom.wordpress.com/">Peter
Scott</a> is the only blogger in the
universe who is
<a href="http://pjsrandom.wordpress.com/2006/08/14/things-that-annoy/">thoughtful</a>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>BBC2 Friday night. A <a href="http://www.thefall.info/fallsite/?p=320">repeat</a>
but memorable for some great footage, interviews and these two
<a href="http://homepages.shu.ac.uk/~llrdjb/fall_doc.pdf">quotes</a> from Mark E.
Smith</p>

<blockquote><p>John Walters wrote me a letter and said, you know, &#8216;you are the worst
group I&#8217;ve ever seen in the [laughs] in the history of mankind&#8217;
[laughs]. He was good like that, John Walters was. You ever meet him?
No, he was f**king fantastic. He said, &#8216;you were the worst,
tuneless, rubbish I&#8217;ve ever heard&#8217;, you know, &#8216;even worse than
Siouxsie and the Banshees&#8217;. This is what he wrote &#8216;you&#8217;re even worse
than Siouxsie and the Banshees. I didn&#8217;t believe it was possible.&#8217; You
know what I mean? [laughs] He was a gem, what a gem. He said, &#8216;please
do a session&#8217; [laughs].
All the group stayed up to watch the Old Grey Whistle Test. Not that I
would, personally but you couldn&#8217;t see the group, that was the
funniest bit. They stayed up to watch
<a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=J8W9sQJaAdM">it</a> with all their parents
[cackles]. And all you could see was like Michael Clark baring his
arse on the f**king screen, you know. F**king great. It was dead
funny.</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Google recently announced some
<a href="http://www.google.com/googlenotebook/newfeatures.html">enhancements</a> to
the <a href="http://www.google.com/notebook">Notebook</a> and I must admit that,
while the concept left me cold initially, I am now starting to make more
use of this software.</p>

<p>While I use <a href="http://www.blinklist.com/">Blinklist</a> for shared (more
permanent) bookmarks, I tend to use Google Notebook for snippets,
jottings, interesting links and, err, notes that I may need to access
from both home and work (in fact potentially from any computer).</p>

<p>For example, yesterday I had a query about my online tax return and was
forced to call the pension administrator followed by the Inland Revenue
and jotted down answers to my questions.</p>

<p>Previously, I might have emailed myself the notes from work to home so I
then could write a followup letter. This would mean the information was
accessible from work (Sent) and home (Inbox) but having it available on
a Google server is preferable and less typing.</p>

<p>I used to keep draft blog postings in WordPress but didn&#8217;t like the
drafts cluttering up the dashboard so now these random thoughts also get
stored in Google Notebook.</p>

<p>Obviously, all of my notebooks are private but there is some interesting
<a href="http://www.google.com/notebook/search?q=oracle">information</a> out there
lurking in shared notebooks that isn&#8217;t accessible from conventional
sources.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have an increasing tendency to skim all my RSS feeds in
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/05/25/good-vibes-from-netvibes/">Netvibes</a>just
to finish reading them as quickly as possible and not really reading (or
enjoying) the content.</p>

<p>My therapist recommended some diversion therapy; install the
<a href="http://gregarius.net/">Gregarius</a> aggregator locally on my PC, import
my OPML and experiment with Dave
<a href="http://scripting.wordpress.com/">Winer</a>&#8217;s controversial &#8217;<a href="http://www.reallysimplesyndication.com/riverOfNews">River of
News</a>&#8217; concept.</p>

<p>Now my previous experiments with
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/01/31/finally-succumbed/">Joomla</a>
and subsequently <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> and
<a href="http://drupal.org/">Drupal</a> have been made incredibly easy by
<a href="http://www.wampserver.com/en/">Wamp</a> (a packaged distribution of mySQL,
PHP and Apache).</p>

<p>And so it proved again. A mere 7 minutes to get Gregarius working. A
further 29 minutes to fail to work out why Netvibes has chosen to
resurrect and export some dear, dead departed
<a href="http://oracledoug.com/serendipity/">feeds</a> (with Japanese writing) from
beyond the grave.</p>

<p>Gregarius has the conventional <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/70276096@N00/249333422/in/photostream/">two
pane</a>
(feed-article) view and you can quickly review all articles from all
blogs in reverse date order. You can then choose to expand any
<a href="http://flickr.com/photos/70276096@N00/249333418/in/photostream/">articles</a>
of particular interest.</p>

<p>Of course, for the full cascading river
<a href="http://flickr.com/photos/70276096@N00/249333419/in/photostream/">effect</a>,
I had to collapse the feeds and remove all
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/03/02/tags-categories-and-labels/">tags</a>,
folders and categories to simply let all feeds flow as one raging
torrent. There are no Oracle blogs anymore. You are all fighting for a
place on the raft.</p>

<p>The default Gregarius theme is a little monochrome for my liking or
maybe that is the default &#8216;Newspaper&#8217; view (black and white and read all
over) but there are other
<a href="http://flickr.com/photos/70276096@N00/249333421/in/photostream/">themes</a>
available to liven up the RSS experience.</p>

<p>So now I am no longer skimming my 81 feeds but blissfully wallowing in
this river of news.</p>

<p>All of this excitement is almost enough to encourage me to investigate
pricing (again) for hosted PHP/mySQL providers so I can read the same
feeds from multiple computers.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&#8216;Who is the SQL Server DBA ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I am&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Who is the Siebel Administrator ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Err, me&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Who is the keeper of DNS ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I am&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Do you want a screenshot of that ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No. I am only noting down areas where we diverge from the default OOTB
configuration.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Who do we ask about adding entries to the Active Directory ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Him&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Who is the Web meister ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Me&#8217;</p>

<p>And so, when working with such intelligent people (Jack of All Trades),
it is entirely possible to install, patch and demonstrate the features
of a highly available, resilient Siebel 7.8 Enterprise, within one day,
featuring:-</p>

<blockquote><p>Two Web Servers (IIS 6.0) load balanced by Cisco CSS
Active-Active MSCS cluster (Gateway, EIM, Workflow, Assignment
Manager, Data Quality)</p>

<p>Two Siebel Servers (Object Manager) using native load balancing</p>

<p>Clustered SQL Server database</p></blockquote>

<p>A thoroughly satisfying and productive day with plenty of intelligent,
probing questions from technical people eager to learn and willing to
read
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/06/13/helping-people-read-books/">books</a>.</p>

<p>A day that should have ended in handshakes all round, a premature end to
the engagement, a glowing testimonial from the customer about yours
truly to their account manager that he, in turn, forwarded to my
manager.</p>

<p>But no. This customer now wants to deploy SSL, authenticate using Active
Directory and would like to see how Single Sign On (SSO) could help the
business.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>And just this once, not mine.</p>

<p>When you take out a Self Invested Pension Plan (SIPP), most SIPP schemes
are unable to accept Protected Rights.</p>

<p>Imagine my surprise, then, when <a href="http://www.sippdeal.co.uk/">Sippdeal</a>
contact me asking for authorisation to make a payment from my SIPP to
Equitable Life in respect of a refund of Protected Rights payments that
the Government are requesting, in turn, from Equitable Life.</p>

<p>Equitable Life claim this refund is now very urgent because the original
request was made in January 2006 and no response has been received.</p>

<p>I ask Sippdeal why they didn&#8217;t forward this original letter from
Equitable Life to me in January. The answer was simple. Sippdeal did not
receive any such letter from Equitable Life in January 2006. Sippdeal
are efficient. Sippdeal communicate via email. Sippdeal send me copies
of correspondence from Equitable scanned into a PDF. Sippdeal answer my
emails promptly. Sippdeal are well informed and helpful.</p>

<p>So I contact Equitable Life directly and ask them why a refund of
protected rights contributions is required from a SIPP that was legally
unable to receive any protected right contributions.</p>

<p>Inevitably, after a lengthy delay and some &#8216;research&#8217;, it transpires the
letter (both of them in fact) were sent to Sippdeal &#8216;by mistake&#8217; and
should have been sent to my other pension provider.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not sure whether my
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2005/11/21/my-personal-pensions-crisis/">decision</a>
to consolidate all my pension plans into a SIPP was the correct one and
whether my SIPP funds will outperform the fund managers in grey suits.</p>

<p>However, for the pleasure of not having to deal with Equitable Life any
longer (apart from the rare interruption caused by their unbelievable
incompetence), I&#8217;m prepared to take my chances.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday I had a pretty bad day. I got up early and drove to
Chesterfield. Unfortunately, the performance environment was not
available as originally planned (overrunning weekend engineering works)
so I simply collected some data and drove back to London.</p>

<p>Still, it could have been worse. The original plan had me staying
overnight in a hotel in Chesterfield.</p>

<p>Although this unexpected change of plan was inconvenient and tiring, it
still wasn&#8217;t as terrible as this gentleman&#8217;s <a href="http://oiyoublogoff.blogspot.com/2006/09/fear-not-blog-fans.html">bad
day</a></p>

in one of my beehouses. I was stung so much that I have given up
beekeeping as a pursuit.</p></blockquote>

<p>I am certain he has made the correct decision in giving up beekeeping.
Maybe he should now study &#8216;How to unlock a door - quickly !&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;If I were to give you the 5 pounds, what exactly would you spend the
money on ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;m going into town to buy Emma a CD for her birthday.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;&#8230;but surely 5 pounds won&#8217;t be enough.&#8217;</p>

funding from an angel investor. Net margin close to 100%. What will your
turnover be in years 2 and 3 ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh just forget it. I&#8217;ll use some of my babysitting money.&#8217;</p>

<p>[In a amazing development, the entrepreneur reveals she has a second
business which she hasn&#8217;t even disclosed]</p>

<p>&#8216;What babysitting money ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I got 20 pounds for babysitting for the Barnstormworths last Saturday
night&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Why the Barnstormworths ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Well they pay the most and I always babysit when Mrs Barnstormworth is
driving&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What do you mean ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Well - it&#8217;s 3.75 pound an hour but if Mr Barnstormworth has been
drinking, he can&#8217;t do the sums for quarters of an hour so he just rounds
up to 5 pound an hour.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Any plans to grow the business ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Well Mum said next year, I could babysit in mid-week if my homework was
finished and after midnight the rate doubles&#8217;.</p>

<p>&#8216;OK. Let me tell you where I stand&#8230;&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Dad - please can I just have 5 pounds or I&#8217;ll miss the bus ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I like the sound of the business model but the valuation is simply
ridiculous so I am prepared to make you an offer of 4 pounds for 10%
equity in the CD racketeering business and 40% equity in the babysitting
company. &#8217;</p>

<p>[After this astounding and unexpected turnaround, this young person
looks to have secured the funding]</p>

<p>&#8216;However there is one important fact that you have completely overlooked
- a fatal flaw&#8230;&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What&#8217;s that, Dad ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;You won&#8217;t have any time for babysitting as you&#8217;ll be staying in looking
after Norman Junior while me and your mum go out and enjoy ourselves.
This service will be completely free of charge. Therefore, I am
withdrawing my offer. You didn&#8217;t pitch well. You don&#8217;t have a viable
business plan. You don&#8217;t know anything about
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/07/14/30-second-guide-to-crm/">CRM</a>.
You&#8217;re young and inexperienced. You don&#8217;t listen to advice. So that&#8217;s
it. I&#8217;m not interested in working with you and I&#8217;m certainly not
interested in investing so I&#8217;m out.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Mum - can I have 5 pounds ?&#8217;</p>
