  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;m cut out for a career in pre-sales as I have an
irritating tendency to blush and my left eye twitches horribly when I
tell half-truths.</p>

<p>However, on Sunday afternoon, in order to welcome my loved ones back
from Holland, I donned a smart dark suit with a crisp white shirt and
business-like grey tie. I then loitered around the lower level of
Heathrow Terminal 1. I chose to invest the money I saved on the standard
taxi fare in a very stylish (and not stupid looking) Bluetooth
<a href="http://www.carphonewarehouse.com/commerce/servlet/gben-pd-ProductAccessories?S=230&amp;PN=MAIN.COMMERCE.ACCESSORIES.BLUETOOTH.HEADSETS&amp;modelName=&amp;manId=&amp;modelId=&amp;fullArticleName=MAIN.UK.INTERNET.PRODDISPLAY.PALETTES.BLUETOOTH.GLOBAL&amp;subCatFullArticleName=MAIN.UK.INTERNET.PRODDISPLAY.PALETTES.BLUETOOTH.HEADSETS&amp;subCategoryName=&amp;categoryName=&amp;parentPalette=&amp;accessoryid=MOTWCPHFBT&amp;accessoryName=Motorola%20H300%20Bluetooth%20headset">headset</a>
offering hands free operation.</p>

<p>As the incoming flight was inevitably delayed by two spaced out students
who checked in and then spent another hour checking out every single
item for sale in every single retail outlet at Schipol, I had an
unexpected 75 minutes to kill so I wandered around keeping an eye out
for celebrities, potential terrorists or weirdos.</p>

<p>A lovely, foreign lady approached me and asked how to get to &#8216;Terminal 2
Lufthansa, please&#8217; so I consulted the information board and directed her
to Bus Stop 1 for the courtesy bus. Curiously, this selfless act human
kindness and my authoritative presence led to a flurry of more people
approaching asking for assistance: &#8216;Where to check-in for BMI to
Copenhagen ?&#8217;, &#8216;Where to get English money ?&#8217;, &#8216;When will BA74 from
Brussels arrive ?&#8217; and &#8216;Why are the toilets so (expletive deleted)
filthy ?&#8217;</p>

<p>I cheerfully answered the questions free of charge: &#8216;Upstairs&#8217;,
&#8216;Currency Exchange or that cashpoint might be cheaper&#8217;, &#8216;Sorry - no
idea&#8217; and &#8216;Don&#8217;t know where you come from but that&#8217;s spotless by British
standards&#8217;.</p>

<p>Finally, after an overpriced medium Latte, the flight landed and the
monitor changed from &#8216;BD108 Amsterdam: Expected <del>16:17</del>, <del>16:24</del>,
16:37&#8217; to &#8216;Landed 16:45&#8217; and finally to &#8216;Baggage in hall&#8217;.</p>

<p>I carefully pulled out a sheet of A4 paper and inscribed &#8216;BRIGHTSIDE&#8217; in
blue marker pen. I quickly called my son at home, told him to get the
roast out of the oven, hoover throughout, wash the toilets, air the
washing and call me back immediately.</p>

<p>My glorious headset illuminated &#8216;Blue&#8217; and I told my controller &#8216;Yeah -
I&#8217;m just picking up at T1 now. Can make Wimbledon in 55 minutes. Roger.
Over and out.&#8217;</p>

<p>I then identified prime position on the metal barrier and squeezed in
next to a young lady keenly waiting for her boyfriend who had been
ski-ing (and unfaithful) in Austria. I unzipped my jacket and extracted
my outsize A4 sign which I held aloft. The lady muttered &#8216;Bloody minicab
drivers.&#8217;</p>

<p>New arrivals from India, America and Western Europe looked enquiringly
at my sign but I shook my head with disdain. Tall people riding
bicycles, smoking tulips and carrying joints emerged. At last, the
Amsterdam flight was here.</p>

<p>Finally, Norma and Norma Jean arrived. My daughter&#8217;s face went bright
pink, she frowned and nudged her mother who was completely oblivious. I
proudly held the &#8216;BRIGHTSIDE&#8217; sign even higher and fiddled with the
volume on my Borg headset.</p>

<p>After hearing about Anne Frank&#8217;s house, the red light area and the
&#8216;coffee shops&#8217;, I helped to unload the heavy suitcase and opened the
front door for the excited but exhausted European globetrotters. When I
politely asked about the possibility of a tip, Norma replied:</p>

<p>&#8216;Yeah. I&#8217;ll give you an excellent tip. Never eat yellow snow.&#8217;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&#8216;Holy Father. It is almost 31 years since City&#8217;s last trophy. Since
then, I have:</p>

<ul>
<li>Failed to install Oracle 10gR3 Grid Control to experiment with the
Siebel Management Pack.</li>
<li>Failed to configure bridged networking on my Siebel 8.0/Oracle
10g/RedHat VMware environment. Consequently, I have just deleted the
complete 20GB environment in a fit of pique.</li>
<li>Nearly exploded at the woeful response to a ticket with Bluehost
asking why two functioning cron jobs were a) removed and b) failed
to work when reinstated.</li>
<li>Failed to resolve a trivial but incredibly annoying problem with AVG
mail filter.</li>
<li>To top it all, I don&#8217;t even know the difference between MB and Mbps.</li>

<p>&#8216;My dear son. You are indeed a worthless sinner. May the Lord may mercy
on your soul. To seek forgiveness and redemption, please say three Hail
Marys, one Our Father and request a transfer to pre-sales.&#8217;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>What could possibly be better than a romantic city break in Amsterdam
with your loved one in the glorious spring sunshine ?</p>

<p>That would be lovely but, unfortunately, Norma has chosen to take her
loved one, Norma- Jean to Holland to indulge in culture, canals, Anne
Frank, trampolining, tulips and space-cake.</p>

<p>Never mind. What could possibly be better than a lazy weekend dedicated
to father-son bonding ? A chance to catch up in the beer garden on all
the events of the week at work and school respectively. A chance to hire
&#8216;Borat&#8217; on DVD and laugh helplessly.</p>

<p>A chance to order pizza with garlic bread instead of defrosting that
meal in the freezer. A chance to go to bed whenever we damn well please.
A chance to play music loud. A chance for father and son to go to see a
real football match, err, well Charlton v Newcastle.</p>

<p>That would be lovely but, unfortunately, Norman Junior III has foolishly
spurned this glorious opportunity in favour of a &#8216;sleepover&#8217; followed by
paint-balling with his real mates.</p>

<p>Oh well. What could be better than a night in the pub followed by a
curry with your mates ?</p>

<p>Nothing.</p>

1.  &#8216;Kingsbridge, Devon - where on earth is that - Somerset ?&#8217;

<pre><code>Why is everyone continually engaged; my mum, my sister, Phyllis and

<p>Answers:
1.  Kingsbridge is in Devon.
2.  There is nothing wrong with the telephone. Your mother, sister and</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am currently trying to assist with a couple of long standing Service
Requests. This type of work is interesting because the issue is normally
pretty deep rooted and complicated. These escalations are also very
challenging because lots of very intelligent people have already spent a
lot of man-hours investigating the problem.</p>

<p>Anyway, one of the first steps is to review associated Service Requests
and try to determine whether they are indeed related to the issue under
investigation.</p>

<p>The opening paragraph of one such SR contained this bold assertion from
the customer: &#8216;As you can see, we have populated the interface tables
correctly and EIM still doesn&#8217;t work.&#8217;</p>

<p>This was a interesting statement and was directly related to the problem
I was looking at. This statement went unchallenged by Technical Support
so I took it at face value and continued my analysis.</p>

<p>There was further empirical evidence that this data load would fail as
changes to the corresponding meta-data in the Siebel Repository had been
made in version 7.8. A user key definition on this table had been
inactivated which was previously present in 7.5. Interesting.</p>

<p>A few hours later, I returned to this SR as I was about to actually try
loading data into the same Siebel tables. This seemed rather pointless
if it wasn&#8217;t going to work. However, I started from scratch, read the
documentation and created my own simple test case for a single record.</p>

<p>Sure enough, the customer was correct. Even though, I had populated the
correct columns in the correct interface table with the correct data,
Siebel failed to populate the target tables.</p>

<p>However, when I reviewed the EIM log files more carefully, the errors
were the conventional (foreign key lookup failed) type. I fixed the test
data, re-ran the load script and sure enough data appeared in the target
tables and was visible in the Siebel application.</p>

<p>So, the customer was actually mistaken and I suspect his bold assertion
including the four little words &#8216;As you can see&#8217; also misled the
technical support engineer.</p>

<p>Last night, my son told me that playing World of Warcraft was much, much
quicker since the recent broadband upgrade from 4Mb to 10Mb. This made
sense as online gaming presumably needs lots of bandwidth and Virgin
customer services told me the
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/03/09/free-upgrades-from-virgin-media/">upgrade</a>
would be effective from last Friday.</p>

<p>Out of curiosity, I downloaded a <a href="http://fuller.zen.co.uk/test/">100MB
file</a> (twice) and looked at the download
speeds which were in the range 360-390 KB/sec. Quick but less than you
would expect for a 10Mb connection.</p>

<p>I called my friends at Virgin Media to check the status of my broadband
upgrade. Sure enough, contrary to what I was told, the 10Mb upgrade will
only be activated on 23 March when the engineer installs the V+ box.</p>

<p>So, unless you see it with your own eyes, it didn&#8217;t happen.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The new machine from Dell duly
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/03/07/rapid-fire-service-from-dell/">arrived</a>
yesterday so I hid it safely away in a tall cupboard.</p>

<p>This morning, when no-one was looking, I surreptitiously retrieved the
boxes out of the tall cupboard and carefully cut the boxes open.</p>

<p>Then I quickly hooked up the new PC to my existing keyboard, mouse and
monitor and power cable.</p>

<p>I had a sneak peek at Windows Vista and it looked pretty nice (IE7,
integrated desktop search, media player, shiny new interface).</p>

<p>Then I carefully packed the computer away, taped the boxes up and put
them all back into the tall cupboard.</p>

<p>What am I ?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I currently pay &pound;92 per month to Virgin Media:</p>

<ul>
<li>Telephone Rental - &pound;5.50</li>
<li>Talk Evenings/Weekends - &pound;11</li>

<p>I just called Customer Retentions on 0800 0730591 (not 150) to try to
renegotiate my package after the recent loss of Sky One. It took a while
(15 mins) to get through on the Freephone number but it was worth it.</p>

<p>Without much pushing, the gentleman kindly summarised Wednesday night&#8217;s
episode of
&#8217;<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/03/02/lost-without-lost/">Lost</a>&#8217;
