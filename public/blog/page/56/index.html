  <div class="entry-content"><p>The migration from andyc.wordpress.com is now complete. All articles
have been migrated. All comments have been lovingly preserved. All the
internal links have been fixed (by hand) in a long and painstaking
process. Robots and spiders are crawling all over the new site.</p>

<p>The only omission was a handful of WordPress images. I realised that I
was a little hasty in deleting my old WordPress blog otherwise I could
have easily retrieved these files too. Or a simple
&#8217;<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/">wget</a>&#8217; of the complete site would
have done the job.</p>

<p>Time for a checkpoint, I think. Activate the <a href="http://www.skippy.net/blog/category/wordpress/plugins/wp-db-backup/">WP-DB
Backup</a>
plugin and take a full backup of the MySQL database. Export the complete
blog (posts and comments) to XML. As for Charlie - well that&#8217;s yours
truly for not taking a checkpoint earlier.</p>

<p>I decided I didn&#8217;t like the format of the &#8217;<a href="http://www.w-a-s-a-b-i.com/archives/2006/02/02/wordpress-related-entries-20/">Related
Posts</a>&#8217;
plugin and uninstalled it. However, when I reversed the database
changes, I inadvertently deleted two key WP tables instead of column
attributes. This idiotic error broke my blog. Totally.</p>

<p>So I was forced to delete my shiny, new WordPress installation and
database, and repeat the whole migration process again (including the
time consuming and painstaking change to all internal links) from my
local WordPress installation. Lucky I took that copy otherwise I would
have been really stuck.</p>

<p>Still, I am getting pretty good at the migration from hosted to hosting
WordPress now and, finally, I understand the importance of backups.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have been pretty impressed with <a href="http://dreamhost.com/">Dreamhost</a> so
far:</p>

<ul>
<li>Configured
<a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/">putty</a> for

<li>Installed <a href="http://nbrightside.com/joomla/">Joomla</a> (one-click)</li>
<li>Upgraded to <a href="http://www.php.net/downloads.php#v5">PHP5</a> (one-click)</li>
<li>Installed

(one-click)</li>
<li>Installed <a href="http://nbrightside.com/gregarius/">Gregarius</a> (all by
myself)</li>
</ul>


<p>The only minor issues I have encountered is that I can&#8217;t disable telnet
(insecure) and my analog stats didn&#8217;t get refreshed today.</p>

<p>Dreamhost have a <a href="http://blog.dreamhost.com/">blog</a>, a
<a href="http://wiki.dreamhost.com/index.php/Main_Page">Wiki</a>, support
<a href="http://discussion.dreamhost.com/wwwthreads.pl">forums</a> and any idiotic

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I had a blind date this morning at 06.55. An early start admittedly but
this lady would surely be worth it. The lady&#8217;s name was Iris. I was
supposed to meet her in Terminal 1 at London Heathrow.</p>

<p>Iris was flying in from Russia after a short courtship (19 hours) on the
Internet. I even had an letter (IM) from Iris. Iris said she&#8217;d be
waiting on the right before you reach the shops (which was worrying
enough in itself).</p>

<p>So I slept downstairs on the sofa, snatched some sleep and I booked the
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/04/03/rude-awakening/">taxi</a> 30
minutes earlier than normal.</p>

<p>But, of course, Iris was nowhere to be seen. Stood up once again. Why.
oh why, didn&#8217;t Iris show up ? What&#8217;s wrong with me ? Will I ever find
true love ? I am disconsolate. I am a broken man.</p>

<p>Turns out that <a href="http://iris.gov.uk/">Iris</a> only wants to date high
flying, big earning, international travellers with BA Silver (or above)
and isn&#8217;t interested in peasants in flying to Newcastle. Even if they
are staying in the

<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/09/28/the-fickle-hand-of-fate/">taken</a>.
Choose another domain name.</p>

<p>Sign-up with <a href="http://dreamhost.com/">Dreamhost</a> despite recent bad
press. All the other hosting providers look similar and all have
supporters and critics and, to be fair, Dreamhost were quickest (and
most helpful) to reply to a simple technical enquiry.</p>

<p>Payment processing takes a long, long time which is a little
disconcerting.</p>

<p>Install WordPress 2.0.4 using One-Click installation. Shortly receive
email stating &#8216;Blog creation failed. Please try again later&#8217; which is
worrying.</p>

<p>Repeat installation of WordPress which is successful.</p>

<p>Export existing blog from <a href="http://wordpress.com/">WordPress.com</a> into
XML.</p>

<p>Import XML into a local installation of WordPress 2.1 alpha (includes
all comments).</p>

<p>Import XML into new blog. Everything imported successfully apart from
the comments.</p>

<p>Install
<a href="http://www.technosailor.com/wordpress-to-wordpress-import/">TechSailor</a>
plugin. Delete some posts with comments and repeat complete import.
Existing posts are skipped and import includes comments for some posts
but not others.</p>

<p>Delete complete WordPress installation, recreate mySQL database and
empty blog.</p>

<p>Install TechSailor again. Import XML which works fast and without error.
All posts, all comments, all categories are present. In fact, everything
is intact.</p>

<p>Change theme to the stunning
<a href="http://www.plaintxt.org/themes/barthelme/">Barthelme</a> which was the
main reason for all this effort.</p>

<p>Upgrade Barthelme to the latest version (1.2.2).</p>

<p>Notice that the &#8216;About&#8217; page wasn&#8217;t imported and recreate.</p>

<p>Change permalink format to include name/date as used on WordPress.com.</p>

<p>Install <a href="http://automattic.com/code/widgets/">widget</a> support and
configure sidebar widgets.</p>

<p>Activate Akismet plug-in (needs WordPress API key).</p>

<p>Install Google <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">Analytics</a> tracking
code.</p>

<p>Stake my claim on <a href="http://technorati.com/">Technorati</a>.</p>

<p>Respond to amusing
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/09/28/google-reader-gets-revamp/#comment-913">comment</a>
accusing me of blatant plagiarism.</p>

<p>Delete WordPress blog. Suddenly realise I didn&#8217;t put up a closing
redirect entry. Oh well.</p>

<p>Put kettle on.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Apart from the &#8216;vi&#8217;
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2005/10/10/google-reader/">shortcuts</a>,
I was slightly underwhelmed by Google
<a href="http://www.google.com/reader">Reader</a> when it was released last year.</p>

<p>Imagine my surprise, when I just used Google Reader to quickly check
that I had reinstated full text feeds for this blog. Unless I see it
with my own eyes, I just don&#8217;t believe it.</p>

<p>Google Reader launches with a modest splash screen with some exciting
announcement (which I immediately skipped) and I was greeted by some
unexpected and welcome changes to the interface.</p>

<p>All my feeds appear in a
<a href="http://flickr.com/photos/70276096@N00/255209620/">hierarchy</a> grouped by
&#8216;label&#8217;. However, I must admit I am confused. They used to be &#8216;labels&#8217;.
Now it appears &#8216;labels&#8217; are dead and my categories are &#8216;folders&#8217; or
&#8216;tags&#8217; depending on the context.</p>

<p>Google has also added:</p>

<ul>
<li>Shared articles (but not grouped feeds)</li>
<li>Reading feeds via bookmarks which is an interesting idea</li>
<li>Integration with Google Homepage</li>
<li>Quick subscribe</li>
<li>Support for mobile phones (err, no thanks)</li>
</ul>


<p>Even more strange is the fact I have happened upon something brand new
all by myself.</p>

<p>Nothing on the blogs which I just scanned a minute ago. Nothing on
Technorati. Nothing from Robert Scoble. Nothing on the RSS related
blogs. No text message from the wife. Nothing on the Google blog. No IM
from my son. Nothing on the Google Reader blog. Nothing on digg. Nothing
on reddit. Nothing on del.ici.ous.</p>

<p>This is it. I am finally going be famous. My 15 minutes is here. I am
going to be dugg and the WordPress servers will creak under the strain.</p>

<p>Apart from the fact it took me 7 minutes to compose these words, by
which time this exciting Web 2.0 development will be yesterday&#8217;s vinegar
stained fish&#8217;n&#8217;chip paper.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There I was - teetering on the precipice of getting my own domain name,
a hosted blog, Website, anonymous FTP server, message board, Wiki and
countless other stuff I would never use.</p>

<p>A fully hosted solution (with unlimited bandwidth) on a Linux platform,
the bleeding edge versions of mySQL, Apache, PHP and WordPress, a
&#8216;control panel&#8217;, SSH and the prospect of sharing my wonderful set of
feeds to my adoring public using
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/09/21/drowning-in-a-river-of-news/">Gregarius</a>.</p>

<p>The domain I had set my heart on was &#8216;www.mrbrightside.com&#8217;. When I went
to buy it, I discovered to my disgust that someone (a female in
Doncaster) currently had
<a href="http://www.whois.net/whois_new.cgi?d=mrbrightside.com">control</a> of this
domain.</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t even know idiots speculated on domain names so this was a
terrible shock but this
<a href="http://www.mikeindustries.com/blog/archive/2005/03/how-to-snatch-an-expiring-domain">article</a>
was most useful. Then fate smiled upon me to overcome this minor
setback.</p>

<p>When I consulted the &#8217;<a href="http://www.whois.net/">whois</a>&#8217; entry, I found
that the domain had recently expired. On 16 September 2006 to be
precise. How very exciting ! This surely means I am destined to succeed
after all.</p>

<p>All I need to do now is to wait patiently until the domain is released
back to the Interweb so I can register it. The only outstanding question
is whether I sign up for 1, 2 or even 10 years.</p>

<p>I was excited. I was confident. I started to research various hosting
providers in the US and the UK. People I trusted used
<a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/">DreamHost</a> and were blissfully happy with
the service.</p>

<p>I was poised with my credit card, polling the domain name every 30
seconds. I had to take compassionate leave from work citing &#8216;illness of
someone very close to me&#8217; in this dogged pursuit of &#8216;mrbrightside.com&#8217;.</p>

<p>In my spare 29 seconds, I busied myself researching the themes, plugins
and applications I would be using in this brave new world.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly the status of &#8216;www.mrbrightside.com&#8217; changed to &#8216;Locked&#8217;.
Apparently this means that the owner has not responded to multiple
emails, phone calls and final demands to renew his interest and the
release of the domain name is now imminent.</p>

<p>Fantastic. Only Brandon Flowers can stop me now.</p>

<p>Then, as always, fate intervened again but this time she wasn&#8217;t smiling.</p>

<p>The wizzened old hag from Doncaster returned from market in Malton and
finally decided to renew the domain even though it cost her more money
than if she had acted two days earlier. Maybe Yorkshire folk aren&#8217;t so
mean, after all.</p>

<p>Then the blogosphere erupted,
<a href="http://www.web-strategist.com/blog/2006/09/27/dreamhost-kindly-respond-to-andy/">moaning</a>
about the <a href="http://nightmarehost.blogspot.com/">appalling</a> level of
service provided by Dreamhost - downtime, poor support, bad
communication, slow connectivity, veiled threats, termination without
due cause.</p>

<p>Phew. What a relief. That was a narrow escape. Fate was really saving me
from a disaster.</p>

<p>So, on reflection, I decided to take the easy option - put my wallet
away and do absolutely nothing.</p>
