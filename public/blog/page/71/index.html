      </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I currently use <a href="http://my.yahoo.com/">MyYahoo!</a> as my home page. I have
looked at MyYahoo&#8217;s next
<a href="http://www.yahoo.com/?p=1148568392">incarnation</a>, played with Google&#8217;s
<a href="http://www.google.co.uk/ig?hl=en">personalised</a> home page and Windows
<a href="http://www.live.com/">Live!</a> but none are as flexible as I would like.</p>

<p>So, prompted by the only other Oracle gentleman with enough taste to
choose WordPress,
<a href="http://rahulagarwal.wordpress.com/2006/03/27/netvibes/">Rahul</a>, I
decided to experiment a little with
<a href="http://www.netvibes.com/">Netvibes</a>.</p>

<p>Out of the box, the default Netvibes
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/70276096@N00/152958731/">screen</a> doesn&#8217;t
look too remarkable. A widget for Gmail, a search box, example RSS feeds
and the obligatory Flickr feed to display other peoples lovely cats on
your home page.</p>

<p>However, the real power of Netvibes lies in the power and flexibility to
configure the page(s) to be exactly what you want, where you want and
how you want.</p>

<p>Thankfully, the
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/70276096@N00/152958732/in/photostream/">signup</a>
page is blissfully simple so you get an account immediately and
painlessly.</p>

<p>One of the main things I am interested in is a personalised portal with
access to all my RSS feeds. Simply click on &#8216;Add Content&#8217; and you can
either add individual feeds by URL or, in my case,
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/70276096@N00/152958733/in/photostream/">import</a>
my OPML from Newsgator Online.</p>

<p>Wait a few seconds and all my RSS feeds are successfully
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/70276096@N00/152958734/in/photostream/">imported</a>
and, even better, my hierarchy is preserved. Impressive.</p>

<p>You can simply select an individual RSS feeds from the available list.
This presents a brief
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/70276096@N00/152958736/in/photostream/">summary</a>
and the option to add the feed to the current page.</p>

<p>Clicking on an article of interest opens up the detailed RSS reader.
This is a fairly standard two pane
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/70276096@N00/152958737/in/photostream/">view</a>
and you can click through to the Web site.</p>

<p>Netvibes offers multiple tabbed pages. I created several pages including
one for all the Oracle blogs I read. I then simply used &#8216;Add to current
page&#8217; for each Oracle blog to create my personalised Oracle blogs
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/70276096@N00/152959945/in/photostream/">page</a>.</p>

<p>This is pretty good but when you are actually reading the Oracle blogs,
the blog hierarchy on the left of the screen is unused and a needless
distraction. No problem - just close it which leaves you with this
newspaper style
<a href="http://flickr.com/photos/70276096@N00/152976288/">screen</a>.</p>

<p>Now to see whether there are any articles of interest. Simply click
&#8216;Expand all&#8217; to
<a href="http://flickr.com/photos/70276096@N00/152959947/">reveal</a> what everyone
is talking about.</p>

<p>One of my pet hates about most RSS readers I have
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2005/12/13/comparison-of-rss-readers/">used</a>
is that it wasn&#8217;t easy to select which blog appears first in the list.
With Netvibes, it is trivial. If you decide Doug Burns is more
interesting than that clown, Andy C, simply
<a href="http://flickr.com/photos/70276096@N00/152959949/in/photostream/">drag&#8217;n&#8217;drop</a>
to put Doug first in the list. No need to rename your favourite authors
as 001Doug, 002Tom, 999Andy. This is the year 2006 and Web 2.0 after
all.</p>

<p>Each tabbed page can be assigned a pretty
<a href="http://flickr.com/photos/70276096@N00/152959950/in/photostream/">icon</a>
and Netvibes comes with a handy set of (growing)
<a href="http://flickr.com/photos/70276096@N00/152959951/in/photostream/">widgets</a>
(Gmail, Yahoo Mail, del.ici.ous, Box.net, Ical, ToDo, Weather) in
addition to featured RSS feeds.</p>

<p>Overall, an excellent piece of well designed, fast software. Netvibes
doesn&#8217;t have a help page. You simply don&#8217;t need one due to the intuitive
interface.</p>

<p>I started out hoping to find a personalised home page and I discovered a
very powerful, customisable RSS reader hidden under covers.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Back in 1995, I was a software engineer for Ingres, working on the OS/2
port. A merchant bank had a serious, intermittent, non-reproducible
problem and Computer Associates kindly bought me a ticket to New York to
go and help them.</p>

<p>The ticket was an open return. I thought &#8216;That&#8217;s nice. That&#8217;s so I can
extend my stay for a lovely weekend city break with my wife&#8217;. The truth
was that it was an open return as I was staying onsite until the problem
was resolved [ PH was right. I am naive ]</p>

<p>I duly took a black briefcase with a magnetic tape with the complete
source code, an umbrella and a bowler hat. The tape was slightly too big
for the briefcase and it was a struggle to shut it. Halfway through the
flight, I decided to read some of the background to the long standing
issue. The briefcase wouldn&#8217;t open. It was jammed. I was petrified that
US Customs were going to ask me to open it. Thankfully, they didn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>When I arrived at the plush offices of the prestigious merchant bank, I
was greeted like royalty. The client was very impressed that an
&#8216;engineer all the way from London&#8217; had come to visit them. They offered
me tea, coffee or water and looked perplexed when I said &#8216;Err - have you
got a Swiss Army Knife ?&#8217;. A suitable tool was produced and they looked
on in amazement as I butchered the lock and held the mag tape aloft.
Come to think of it, I didn&#8217;t have a laptop so I must have compiled the
Ingres product on their server.</p>

<p>My other memories of this trip are going to a cinema in Times Square to
watch &#8216;Pulp Fiction&#8217; in an effort to stay awake and beat jet lag.
Somehow, this seemed to enhance the cinematic experience further.</p>

<p>Then I called home, trying to find out the United score against Crystal
Palace. People kept telling me &#8216;Oh you haven&#8217;t heard about Cantona. God
it was absolutely unbelievable. He was sent off, leapt into the crowd
and attacked a Palace fan with a Kung Fu kick&#8217;. I didn&#8217;t believe a word
of it and never got to find out the actual score (1-1) until I returned
home.</p>

<p>And the actual bug - it was a one liner. A race condition introduced by
a misplaced #ifdef.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The more observant among you will have noticed the addition of a
<a href="http://www.statcounter.com/">StatCounter</a> button to the sidebar.</p>

<p>The available StatCounter metrics are quite basic as the hosted
Wordpress blog is limited to the HTML (not the Javascript) version of
the tracking code. So advanced features like path analysis and keywords
are not available but the reports do include domain information,
breakdown of unique and returning visitors, visit length, pages per
visit and browser metrics.</p>

<p>Combined with the statistics on the WordPress dashboard which do include
the referrer and search engine, you get a pretty complete picture of
traffic. The StatCounter reports also go back indefinitely compared to
the 30 days on WordPress.</p>

<p>It would be neat if WordPress could open up more of the Google
<a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">Analytics</a> functionality so all the
reports were under one roof.</p>

<p>Guess what. Most people glance at one page and stay for less than a
second.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I used to politely spurn all invitations to join
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/03/03/linkedincom/">LinkedIn.com</a>
with &#8216;No thanks. I already get enough spam email&#8217;.</p>

<p>I finally capitulated as an increasing number of people I knew had
signed up. In any case, I was getting increasingly desperate in my
search for <a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2005/12/09/probably-the-best-phish-in-the-world/">Janet
Oldsgate</a>.</p>

<p>However, if you have any reason to interact with a recruitment agent for
any reason, think long and hard before adding him to your network.</p>

<p>A mutual friend made this mistake and consequently I received an
unsolicited approach (email and then a phone call) from a young lady.
Pity she was only trying to get me a highly paid job in the financial
sector with all those merchant bankers. Thanks but no thanks.</p>
