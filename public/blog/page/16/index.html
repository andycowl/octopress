  <div class="entry-content"><p>This week I am attending an excellent training course on Linux System
Administration at Oracle&#8217;s offices in Moorgate, near London. The course
is given by <a href="http://prutser.wordpress.com/about/">Harald van
Breederode</a>, an excellent trainer
who manages to combine deep technical, real-life expertise with a rare
ability to explain complex things in simple terms with a sense of
humour.</p>

<p>As is traditional, each attendee was asked to give a precis of his/her
job role, star sign, experience with Oracle, most embarrassing
professional moment, any exposure to Unix (Linux), favourite band and
expectations for the course.</p>

<p>Although I have used various flavours of Unix since embarking on a
degree in Computer Science at Warwick University in 1981 and then
working for a variety of software houses, my first experience of Linux
didn&#8217;t come until December 1999.</p>

<p>At that time, I was working at Sequent and had ported a lot of GNU
software utilities and tools to Dynix/ptx so I had an interest in GNU
software. In the midst of the dot com boom, I had responded to a job
posting on Usenet and subsequently been interviewed for a Oracle
developer role at a small UK Internet company. The embryonic company had
less than 10 employees and provided marketing reports, segmentation and
campaign management based on click-stream analysis.</p>

<p>If successful, my first task would be to migrate 15 production Oracle
databases from Oracle 8.0.5 on Windows NT to Oracle 8.1.6 on Linux.
After the interview, I figured it might be prudent to actually
familiarise myself with Linux and how to install and configure Oracle on
this platform.</p>

<p>Back then, our house possessed a single desktop computer running Windows
95 so the first step was to obtain a copy of the Linux operating system.
I sent off the princely sum of &pound;3 (including postage and packing) to the
wonderfully named <a href="http://www.linuxemporium.co.uk/">Linux Emporium</a>
(which I am pleased to see survives to this day) and waited patiently
for my CD to arrive in the post. Norma raised her eyebrows at a blank CD
anonymously packaged in a plain brown envelope but still.</p>

<p>This method of Linux distribution seems a little quaint and
old-fashioned when, nowadays, you can download and burn a Live CD in a
matter of minutes but back than I had a dial-up 56K modem and
downloading a full Linux distribution would probably have taken 3 weeks.</p>

<p>As I recall, I had sole use of the PC back then (Norma didn&#8217;t use it for
anything) so I didn&#8217;t have to bother with a dual-boot system or any
pesky backups so I simply inserted the CD, immediately made a pigs ear
of partitioning the hard disk, inadvertently formatting it in the
process and proceeded to install <a href="http://www.redhat.com/">RedHat</a>.</p>

<p>Given that I knew that my prospective employer had already selected as
SuSE the preferred platform (they offered a bundled support package for
Oracle and SuSE), the choice of RedHat seems a rather odd decision. I
can only assume it was because I had already seen more FAQ&#8217;s, HOWTO&#8217;s
and community support available for RedHat than SuSE. Although, knowing
me, the fact that the RedHat CD was 50p cheaper than SuSE can not be
ruled out.</p>

<p>Obviously the years, coupled with the drink and drugs, have taken their
toll, so my memory is slightly hazy after 9 years but I do remember a
tinge of excitement as white text on a black background announcing
system messages detecting (or more likely failing to detect) various
elements of hardware and peripherals rapidly scrolled past my eyes.</p>

<p>Eventually, I was surprised and delighted to see a desktop complete with
a login box rendered on my screen. However, I was equally nonplussed but
not wholly surprised when my mouse didn&#8217;t work. Now although &#8216;Tools are
for fools&#8217;, the Oracle 8i installer is normally run as a GUI (Java)
application so, unfortunately, I had to resolve this issue.</p>

<p>Not for the first time, I was now completely stuck as I only had one
computer. My impetuousness meant I couldn&#8217;t simply boot back into
Windows to research the problem so I did &#8216;Altavista&#8217;ed at work, printing
out a wealth of similar looking issues and resolutions and started
troubleshooting.</p>

<p>Norma was a little suspicious of me being locked away for hours on end,
messing around on the computer with my new shiny, blank CD but
graciously ignored the alternating screams of anguish and ecstasy
emanating from the bedroom.</p>

<p>I soon got comfortable with booting to a command line with no Windows
(&#8216;init 3&#8217;) and actually managed to configure a device driver for my
mouse and I believe I may have even recompiled the kernel. Not because I
needed to but well, because I could.</p>

<p>When I eventually got movement out of the rodent and was able to log in,
it was incredibly satisfying.</p>

<p>After that, installing Oracle was fairly straightforward as I had
already used Oracle on Solaris. However, I recall running Oracle in my
environment was a rather different matter as I was perilously close to
the absolute minimum specification (64MB of of physical memory) required
for Oracle 8i.</p>

<p>All of this work paid dividends as I was summoned back for a second
interview and I was able to talk a little more knowledgeably about the
potential issues and pitfalls of a Windows to Linux Oracle migration.</p>

<p>Needless to say, this was rather a verbose answer for the course so I
just said &#8216;I once blagged a job as an Oracle DBA managing Oracle 8i on a
handful of self-built servers running SuSE.&#8217;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Unfortunately, I wasn&#8217;t able to get a ticket to the Emirates on Tuesday
night so here is my match report culled from my stream of inane drivel
on <a href="http://identi.ca/andyc/">identi.ca</a>.</p>

<p>Preparing for the big game&#8230;</p>

<p>&#8216;My wife just gave me the shock of my life. She said &#8216;We may have a big
problem here.&#8217; Thought TV was bust. Turned out son &#8216;lost&#8217; his PE bag.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Saw a couple of Gooners on way to Emirates. Lowered car window and
shouted &#8216;Manchester, Manchester, la, la, la&#8217; at them. They waved back.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Why the feck do Arsenal sing &#8216;The Wonder of You&#8217; ?&#8217;</p>

<p>The game gets underway and the first can of Grolsch gets opened.
&#8216;What a start ! 2-0 after 11 minutes. The tie is over now. The wonder of
Almunia (back to his best) and Gibbs.&#8217;</p>

<p>Half-time arrives, the pundits have their say and the Grolsch is
restocked during the adverts.</p>

<p>&#8216;Urgh ! Jens Lehman - what a nasty and uncalled for surprise !&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;God - I think Steve Rider is going to cry in a minute. Is he a Gooner
?&#8217;</p>

<p>Second half gets underway&#8230;</p>

<p>&#8216;Gibbs off - for Eboue. Well, that&#8217;s a bit harsh. He wasn&#8217;t that bad !
LOL&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Where are all those pretty Red and White Arsenal flags ? Have the
stewards asked for them all back ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh no - someone has left a suspicious package in the corporate seats.
The anonymous caller just said it was under a pretty Red and White
flag.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Jesus - that third goal - Rooney, Ronaldo was absolutely superb ! 3-0.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Walcott off - never actually realised he was playing. As Morrissey
sang, &#8216;You just haven&#8217;t earned it yet, baby.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Who the f*ck are Man United ? Who the f*ck are Man United ? And the
Reds go marching - on, on, on.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Arsenal - you now require 5 (five) goals in 25 minutes.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Rooney off - will play in the Final - and we look forward to the
exertions and energy of Berbatov.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;The commentator raises a good point - Ferguson is never hailed as a
tactical genius (like Rafa, Arsene). Probably for the best.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Still, all Gooners can go home - trophyless - and rest assured this is
a young team with promise for the future. Just like the last 5 years.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Look at Madrid. Look at MUFC. I have a feeling Ronaldo might be staying
put. Not sure whether I&#8217;m pleased about that or not.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Fletcher - red card for a fair tackle - misses Final but you can&#8217;t
referee retrospectively. Otherwise MUFC might have lost to Spurs.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Emirates half-empty at the end - strictly part-time supporters. Don&#8217;t
forget your complimentary Red and White flags on the way out now.&#8217;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A lot has been written about Chelsea&#8217;s recent exit from the Champions
League to an injury time winner from Iniesta at Stamford Bridge that
dumped Chelsea out of the competition on the away goals rule to
Barcelona.</p>

<p>Inevitably, there has been much discussion about the controversial
penalty incidents, the quality of the Norwegian referee, the behaviour
of some Chelsea players during and after the match and even ridiculous
talk of a UEFA conspiracy.</p>

<p>However, two of the main protagonists in this European Cup Semi Final
should reflect and examine the part they played in the semi-final more
closely.</p>

<p>Look again at Iniesta&#8217;s goal. No - come on, stop laughing - and look
closely at the goal.</p>

<p>Who is the closest Chelsea player to Iniesta when he receives the ball ?
Michael Ballack. Just look at Ballack&#8217;s feeble attempt to block
Iniesta&#8217;s shot. This is the dying seconds of a Champions League
semi-final. Ballack actually goes down on one knee and shrinks away from
the ball instead of charging it down.</p>

<p>As for Didier Drogba, he missed a gilt-edged chance in the first leg
that would have given Chelsea a priceless away goal. Drogba also missed
a similar opportunity that would surely have sealed the tie in the
second leg at Stamford Bridge. Drogba will claim his shirt was pulled in
one of the penalty incidents but maybe his reputation for cheating and
diving preceded him and influenced the referee&#8217;s decision.</p>

<p>After 72 minutes, Drogba was substituted. As he walked off, he shook his
head and limped towards the bench. The implication was he was injured
after a heavy tackle and could play no further part. This clearly wasn&#8217;t
a tactical substitution.
Imagine then, my surprise at the final whistle, to see Drogba leap up
from the bench, clad in idiotic flip-flops, running onto the pitch to
harangue the referee and deliver a foul-mouthed, abusive tirade directly
into the cameras and a watching TV audience of millions. No injury. Once
again, just like last May when Drogba needlessly got himself sent off in
the Champions League Final which meant that he could not take a crucial
penalty, Drogba had cheated Chelsea FC and he cheated Chelsea fans.</p>

<p>Finally a word on the Chelsea captain, John Terry, the man who sobbed
like a baby, after his hilarious missed penalty gifted the European Cup
to Manchester United last May. After the final whistle, you can clearly
see John Terry admonishing security stewards who were trying to offer
some protection to the referee as they attempted to escort him from the
field of play. Is a man like John Terry who conducts himself like this
really a role model and the right choice as captain of England ?</p>

<p>Apologies for the slightly delayed post but I was laughing
uncontrollably for much of yesterday.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>On Wednesday 11 January 1989, I went to Loftus Road to see Manchester
United play QPR in an FA Cup 3rd round replay.</p>

<p>As usual, we went for a pint in our favourite pub, &#8216;The Greyhound&#8217; (or
similar), on Shepherd&#8217;s Bush Green before finally spurning one last beer
and reluctantly making our way to the ground.
Loftus Road was packed. The United section behind the goal was full.
Stewards opened up another section along up to the half-way line to
accommodate the large away support.</p>

<p>When we eventually got past the turnstiles, we surged forward onto the
small terrace, singing and chanting, looking forward to an exciting FA
Cup-tie under floodlights.</p>

<p>Shortly before kick-off, more United fans were admitted into our section
and there was another surge forward as they tried to get a decent view,
I&#8217;m a big guy (6&#8217;2&#8221;) and I was (literally) lifted off my feet until
everyone found their place and settled down.</p>

<p>When Tony Gill and then Deiniol Graham scored for United, there was
manic celebrations from all the United fans. Once again, I was lifted
off my feet but I didn&#8217;t care - United had scored !</p>

<p>In the ensuing melee and chaos, a couple of people, including a young
lady, lost their footing and fell onto the concrete terrace. When the
celebrations subsided, these people were simply lifted back to their
feet to continue their vocal support for United as they pressed for a
winner.</p>

<p>Three months later, I watched TV pictures of an tragedy unfolding at a
FA Cup semi-final held at Hillsborough where 96 football fans who, like
me, had travelled to a football match, excited, apprehensive, nervous,
to support their team.</p>

<p>Although I was saddened by the news from Hillsborough, I recall I was
rather blase about the tragedy. After all, I didn&#8217;t support Liverpool
and I suspect we all probably went out for a few pints that night as
Match of The Day was curtailed.</p>

<p>On Monday, I found myself alone in the house and read a copy of The
Independent and was confronted by stark, black and white images of young
people pinned to those metal fences in pens 2 and 3 in Leppings Lane,
gasping for breath, lifted off their feet, unable to stand, unable to
move, unable to breathe.</p>

<p>Innocent, young, passionate, football fans, just like me at Loftus Road,
supporting their team.</p>

<p>Dying. In front of me.</p>

<p>I stared again at the pictures, I read the stories about the mothers,
the sons, the daughters, the fathers. Then, suddenly and spontaneously,
I just broke down and cried like a baby.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s why, for all Manchester United&#8217;s rivalry with Liverpool and for
all the jokes and for all the banter, I have never sung a &#8216;Hillsborough&#8217;
chant in my life.</p>

<p>May the 96 victims of Hillsborough rest in peace.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s fair to say it took me a while to fully &#8216;get&#8217; microblogging. In
fact, initially Twitter left me as
<a href="http://nbrightside.com/blog/2007/03/12/resisting-the-lure-of-twitter">cold</a>
as a corpse in a deep freeze.</p>

<p>Inevitably, things change and like an old woman, I reserve the right to
change my mind more frequently than my underpants, and in 2008, I
started using Twitter to post a continuous bytestream of <a href="http://nbrightside.com/blog/2008/04/29/brief-history-of-inane-drivel">inane
drivel</a>
in less than 140 characters.</p>

<p>Last July, when <a href="http://identi.ca/">identi.ca</a> launched, I immediately
signed up for the open source microblogging service. I even built my own
Laconi.ca <a href="http://nbrightside.com/laconica/">instance</a> - not necessarily
because I intended using it but just to see how easy (or hard) it was to
install and configure the software.</p>

<p>As a controlled experiment, I set myself the task of participating fully
on identi.ca to see how long it would take me to acquire <a href="http://nbrightside.com/blog/2008/07/16/how-to-make-100-friends-on-identi-ca-in-14-days">100
friends</a>
on identi.ca. The answer, surprisingly, was 14 days.</p>

<p>Since then I have really enjoyed the sense of community on identi.ca, I
have met lots of interesting people and enjoy the technically oriented
focus of the folk over there. identi.ca isn&#8217;t Twitter and the majority
of my
&#8217;<a href="http://nbrightside.com/blog/2008/08/19/knowing-me-knowing-you">friends</a>&#8217;
steadfastly continue to use Twitter. This is understandable - Twitter
gets all the media coverage. Twitter is where most people live and
freedom is all about the freedom of choice.</p>

<p>I have continued to be a keen user and advocate of the identi.ca service
as I think it offers several
<a href="http://andyc.tumblr.com/post/72328374/twitter-versus-identi-ca">advantages</a>
over Twitter and it has genuinely made me consider the role of open
source software versus proprietary systems with lock-in and closed data
silos.</p>

<p>identi.ca has continued to be actively developed and it&#8217;s exciting to
follow developments and build each new version as it is released. Evan
Prodromou and the identi.ca team actively participate on identi.ca and
are genuinely responsive to honest, constructive feedback from users.</p>

<p>However, this week has seen a couple of developments that have sowed the
first seeds of doubt about the future of identi.ca (not Laconi.ca) and
raise a nagging concern.</p>

<p>The
<a href="http://controlyourself.ca/2009/03/30/statusnet-coming-soon/">announcement</a>
of a hosted, off the shelf microblogging service -
<a href="http://status.net/">status.net</a>
with premium features costing undisclosed amounts of money.
Obviously, Evan (and the identi.ca team) can&#8217;t exist and feed their
families on the many plaudits, thanks and congratulations of 60,000
identi.ca users and he was always going to have to monetize the service
to pay his mortgage. However, the provision of a paid for service with
premium features raises a few issues. In all the congratulatory
coverage, sensible, intelligent people seem to have conveniently
overlooked this particular &#8216;elephant in the room&#8217;.</p>

<p>There is an obvious potential conflict of interest. If Microsoft are
paying $50,000 for a hosted microblog and demand tight integration with
Outlook which Evan fundamentally disagrees with, will he yield ? Will
the development of other OpenMicroBlogging (OMB) functionality be
delayed due to the demands of paying customers (large or small) on
status.net ?</p>

<p>Obviously, identi.ca is built on Laconi.ca which is Open Source so
anyone is free to fork the code and develop the software independently
from Evan. For example, I could theoretically extract all my data from
identi.ca, import it into my own Laconica instance and microblog away in
the federation of Laconi.ca instances until my heart&#8217;s content.</p>

<p>Today, we get another far more worrying piece of news - identi.ca
obviously have more funding than I thought. My worries about Evan and
his family living in a Montreal hostel, eating beans on toast and
children with no shoes were clearly ill-founded.
Identi.ca have announced the
<a href="http://controlyourself.ca/2009/04/01/identica-acquires-twitter/">acquisition</a>
of Twitter.com with the following immediate results:</p>

<ul>
<li>identi.ca now has a Twitter like theme - urgh !</li>
<li>We are already starting to see the inevitable influx of Twitter
celebrities (Britney Spears, Barack Obama, Guy Kawasaki, Guy
Cashmore, Jonathan Ross).</li>
<li>The &#8217;<a href="http://identi.ca/featured">Featured</a>&#8217; tab on identi.ca used to
feature interesting individuals and long standing identi.ca
advocates. Now it is consumed with Twitterati.</li>
<li>It can only be a matter of time before the spammers follow</li>
</ul>


<p>This reverse takeover of Twitter is rather like applauding The Clash&#8217;s
resolute refusal to play of Top of The Pops and then turning on your
telly to see the band performing &#8216;White Man in Hammersmith Palais&#8217; with
Tony Blackburn as your smiling host.</p>

<p>To use another musical analogy, do you remember the very last song on
the very last tour by the Sex Pistols in America and immortalised in the
film &#8216;Great Rock&#8217;n&#8217;Roll Swindle&#8217; ? After the last song, John Lydon
squats down on his haunches and sneers at the audience.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;Do you ever feel like you&#8217;ve been cheated ?&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>Well, Evan, yes - I do.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Since I <a href="http://nbrightside.com/blog/2005/08/17/dot-bombs">started</a> this
blog, I have maintained an interest in various blog commenting services.
Back in November 2007, I experimented with
<a href="http://nbrightside.com/blog/2007/11/16/sezwho-comment-ratings-system">SezWho</a>
and also
<a href="http://nbrightside.com/blog/2007/11/20/comparison-of-cocomment-cocomments-and-commentful">reviewed</a>
three more similar comment tracking services before finally settling on
<a href="http://nbrightside.com/blog/2008/04/09/25-reasons-you-should-use-disqus">Disqus</a>.</p>

<p>Competition is obviously a good thing but this is proving a tough
climate for small, Web 2.0 companies competing in a small, overcrowded
marketplace and we have recently seen some consolidation in this area.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://sezwho.com/">SezWho</a> - Unfortunately, SezWho
<a href="http://blog.sezwho.com/blog/2009/03/05/sezwho-js-kit/">ceased</a>
trading yesterday with a recommended upgrade path to JS-Kit.</li>
<li><a href="http://disqus.com/">Disqus</a> - still going strong with recent
<a href="http://blog.disqus.net/2009/03/26/upgraded-interface-and-performance/">announcement</a>
of improvements to performance and UI.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.cocomment.com/">coComment</a> - still going albeit with a
horrendous interface.</li>
<li><a href="http://co.mments.com/">co.mments</a> - consigned to the dead pool.</li>
<li><a href="http://commentful.blogflux.com/">commentful</a> - still alive. For
now.</li>
</ul>


<p>The two main commenting services that appear to represent serious
competition for Disqus are <a href="http://intensedebate.com/">IntenseDebate</a>
and <a href="http://js-kit.com/">JS-Kit</a> although I have no personal experience
of either product. Anyone out there used them ?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently, I started messing around with
<a href="http://www.dokuwiki.org/dokuwiki">DokuWiki</a> as a
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=tag:bookmark&amp;do=showtag&amp;tag=bookmark">replacement</a>
for Google Notebook (which Google have helpfully decided to
<a href="http://googlenotebookblog.blogspot.com/2009/01/stopping-development-on-google-notebook.html">ditch</a>)
and <a href="http://www.diigo.com">Diigo</a> (after the well publicised and
unfortunate collapse of another cloud bookmarking service -
<a href="http://ma.gnolia.com/">ma.gnolia</a>).</p>

<p>In recent months I have also contributed to the <a href="http://wiki.habariproject.org/en/Main_Page">Habari
Wiki</a> (MediaWiki), looked
briefly at <a href="http://wikkawiki.org/HomePage">WikkaWiki</a> and read Michael&#8217;s
interesting, thought provoking article about his Wiki nirvana
<a href="http://www.twofishcreative.com/michael/blog/2009/03/10/what-i-want-from-a-wiki">wishlist</a>
with interest.</p>

<p>Last night, a throwaway <a href="http://identi.ca/notice/2986518">post</a> by
<a href="http://identi.ca/crashsystems">Douglass Clem</a> about
<a href="http://www.tiddlywiki.com/">TiddlyWiki</a> resurrected my interest in my
own long neglected, unloved local TiddlyWiki which I then upgraded to
the latest version and then pondered consolidating that content into
DokuWiki.</p>

<p>Today, a couple of colleagues expressed an interest in a group wiki at
work for knowledge management so I have just requested a hosted
<a href="http://twiki.org/">TWiki</a> (which coincidentally is being upgraded
tonight) behind the Oracle corporate firewall. I am curious to see
whether it will fare any better then the placeholder, skeleton
<a href="http://wiki.oracle.com/page/Siebel">Siebel</a> page, I carefully seeded
when Oracle first launched the official, public Oracle
<a href="http://wiki.oracle.com/">Wiki</a> (Wetpaint) nine months ago.</p>

<p>And now, I discover that today, Wednesday 25 March 2009 is the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ward_Cunningham">Wiki</a>&#8217;s 14th
<a href="http://blog.aboutus.org/2009/03/25/wikibirthday-2009-14-years-of-collaboration/">birthday</a>.</p>

<p>You may say &#8216;So what ?&#8217; and attribute all of that to pure coincidence.</p>

<p>You may not find that spooky and disconcerting but I do.</p>
