  <div class="entry-content"><p>A couple of years ago, I was working in Amsterdam (near Holland) chasing
world records for loading lots of data into a Siebel database.</p>

<p>It wasn&#8217;t working very well. The client was unhappy so long hours were
called for.</p>

<p>The Unix team said the expensive SAN was performing optimally.</p>

<p>The DBA team said Oracle was performing optimally.</p>

<p>The Siebel team said Siebel was performing optimally.</p>

<p>Alex Ferguson unexpectedly joined a conference call and said the
Manchester United team were performing optimally.</p>

<p>The truth was that nothing was performing optimally. We could have
loaded data quicker by typing it in.</p>

<p>So, we were all scratching our heads, dying to get into Amsterdam, and
yawning at 23.47 one night when a gentleman appeared with a bottle of
red wine.</p>

<p>&#8216;Has anyone got a corkscrew ?&#8217;</p>

<p>Well it made a pleasant change from &#8216;Is it finished yet ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh. It&#8217;s my birthday today and I&#8217;d like to share this bottle of wine
with the team.&#8217;</p>

<p>Purely, in the interests of team morale, I took a decisive step forward.</p>

<p>&#8216;Just get a biro and sink the cork into the bottle. Then we can all have
a quick drink and watch glance and OEM for another 3 hours.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Sorry. I do not understand what you are meaning.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;OK. Just give me the bottle.&#8217;</p>

<p>I grabbed a biro, plunged it into the cork and pushed. Nothing happened.
I pushed harder. People (including managers) were now looking at me,
exchanging knowing glances (Mad Englishman). Nothing happened.</p>

<p>So, I pushed even harder. Nothing happened. I put the bottle between my
knees and pushed even harder. Finally, the biro plunged into the cork
and the cork consequently plunged into the bottle.</p>

<p>However the impact was slightly more forceful than I intended and I was
sprayed with a fountain of red wine. My pristine white shirt only
accentuated the visual impact.</p>

<p>I paused and gathered myself. Red wine was splattered all over my shirt.
I looked a complete mess. People were sniggering which quickly developed
into hysterical laughter.</p>

<p>I proffered the 3/4 full bottle of red wine, to the birthday boy,
expecting some gratitude.</p>

<p>&#8216;Thanks. Have you got any cups ?&#8217;</p>

<p>So, instead of being known as &#8216;that Siebel guy who helped us load 84
million records in 23 hours with error checking and reconciliation&#8217;, I
was forever labelled as &#8216;the axe murderer&#8217;.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&#8230;have a lot in common.</p>

<p>I was interested to read that <a href="http://www.ocdcentre.com/pages/articles.htm">David
Beckham</a> suffers from
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCD">OCD</a> and simply can not abide an odd
number of <del>lines</del> cans of coke in his fridge</p>

<p>I have a similar obsession about cans of Grolsch in my fridge. 0, 2, 4,
8 but never 1, 3, 5, 6 or 7. If we ever get an odd number, I simply
<del>drink &#8216;em</del> scold the offenders soundly and banish them to the
cupboard (where odd numbers only are allowed).</p>

<p>Similarly, rounds in the pub simply must be equalized by close of
drinking otherwise I come out in an angry, red rash.</p>

<p>I also must practice free kicks and penalties for 7 hours a day until I
actually score one before I go home for my tea. So when England exit the
World Cup on penalties in the quarter finals (again), it certainly won&#8217;t
be my fault.</p>

<p>If the hoovering is not done, then I immediately summon my army of maids
to do it before I can even contemplate sitting down for my tea with Posh
and the kids.</p>

<p>Now, did I put the
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/03/21/a-narrow-escape/">gerbils</a>
out ?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Lee Trundle&#8217;s smile after Swansea&#8217;s victory (in the Sunday Pub League
Final played at, of all places, Cardiff) couldn&#8217;t be any wider without
fracturing his jaw. But what I love about this
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/s/swansea_city/4871362.stm">story</a>
most is the following statement by Swansea FC&#8217;s chairman, Huw Jenkins:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;Maybe it was a heat-of-the-moment thing&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>Possibly, but given Lee Trundle had gone to the trouble of getting a
T-shirt printed with a cartoon depicting a person urinating over a
Cardiff shirt, that seems a little unlikely.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was at my desk at 09.05 this Monday morning. Nothing extraordinary
there but considering I live in South West London and this particular
desk was in Newcastle, this represented quite an achievement. And this
prompt start was only possible due to a considerate, thoughtful taxi
driver. I ordered a taxi at 05.45 on Monday morning. I slept downstairs
on the sofa bed to avoid disturbing the household at that unearthly
hour. I got up at 05.30. The taxi driver rings my doorbell at 05.35. The
following conversation ensues in hushed whispers. Thankfully, for his
sake, it is quite hard to get really angry in a hushed whisper.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;What time is the pickup ?&#8217; &#8216;5.45&#8217; &#8216;What time is it now ?&#8217; &#8216;5.35&#8217; &#8216;Why
have you rung the doorbell ?&#8217; &#8216;To let you know I am here&#8217; &#8216;Why have
you just woken my wife and children up at half five in the morning ?&#8217;
&#8216;Oh. Sorry&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>And with that, he returned to wait in the taxi and any hope of a
(paltry) tip disappeared into the chilly morning air.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>On the return flight from Newcastle to Heathrow, I was sitting behind a
family who were lucky enough to be going to Sydney, Australia for a
holiday. I was immediately behind two young lads (8 and 6). Obviously
both were very excited at flying for the first time.</p>

<p>They were excited when we pushed back, they were nervous when we
accelerated down the runway and they were delirious when we left the
ground.</p>

<p>The lads were absolutely amazed when they could see the houses, rivers,
mountains, railway tracks and motorways from 20,000 feet. Forty five
minutes later, as we descended below the cloud base, the two boys took
in the sights of London. The excitement of the youngest lad now reached
fever pitch.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;Look Paul, Big Ben. Paul. Look there is Big Ben&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>I glanced across. I couldn&#8217;t see Big Ben but I could see a church in
Richmond.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;DAD LOOK THERE IS WEMBLEY STADIUM. LOOK DAD ! WEMBLEY STADIUM&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>I glanced across. I couldn&#8217;t see Wembley Stadium but I could see
Twickenham. Gear down. Airport complex in sight.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong> &#8216;MUM, DAD, PAUL. LOOK ! LOOK ! THERE IS SYDNEY OPERA HOUSE. SYDNEY
OPERA HOUSE. LOOK !&#8217; </strong></p></blockquote>

<p>I glanced across. The little boy was right. Off to the right - Sydney
Opera House.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Or, in my case: Hello BMI, Goodbye BA. Last Monday, my flight to
Newcastle was cancelled and the later one was delayed. When I rebooked
at Ticket Sales, I asked whether I could make use of the business lounge
as a gesture for the inconvenience caused by the delay. Ticket Sales
said that might be possible and to ask at Fast Bag Drop. Fast Bag Drop
said that might be possible and to ask in the Business Lounge. Business
Lounge stared at me disdainfully, in complete disbelief (even though I
was wearing a suit and carrying a laptop) and said: &#8216;But, Sir, you do
not have a business class ticket so that simply will not be possible&#8217;.
When I explained my case again, the lady replied &#8216;But Sir, if we
admitted every delayed passenger into the Business Lounge, there would
be (cash from) chaos&#8217;. I nearly asked &#8216;How many delayed passengers have
come here today and asked for access to the lounge ?&#8217; but instead I
meekly accepted defeat. Two hours later, when I finally got to the
boarding gate. I asked a different lady: &#8216;Can I quickly ask about the
possibility of compensation for the delay ?&#8217; She stared at me
disdainfully, in complete disbelief as if I had asked whether this
flight was going to Mars. She replied &#8216;I&#8217;m sorry, Sir. Could you repeat
that ?&#8217; So I did. She said &#8216;Who told you that you could enquire about
compensation ?&#8217; &#8216;No-one&#8217; &#8216;So why are you asking about compensation ?&#8217;
&#8216;Well there was a notice at Fast Bag Drop stating that for delays for
over 2 hours, passengers should enquire at the gate about the
possibility of compensation&#8217;. &#8216;Oh I see. So why are you asking about
compensation ?&#8217; &#8216;Well my original flight was cancelled and this one has
also been delayed so the total delay is now 2 hours and 15 minutes&#8217;
&#8216;Yes, Sir, but this delay is caused by the weather. There is no
compensation payable for delays caused by the weather&#8217;. Of course, I
knew this but thought it would be worth asking just to see her reaction.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The streets of the fine city of Newcastle were gridlocked on Monday.
Locals despaired as their normal 20 minute commute took 3 hours 40
minutes due to a series of unfortunate events.</p>

<ul>
<li>A public sector strike (against pensions) closing the Metro and a
tunnel under the Tyne.</li>
<li>An attention-seeking individual pretending he wanted to end his life
by jumping off a lofty bridge which meant the closure of the bridge,
more traffic chaos and 57 social workers being summoned.</li>
<li>Another (suspicious) fire in the city.</li>
</ul>


<p>I owe my eternal gratitude to my taxi driver who meekly suggested that I
might like to consider walking 10 minutes (instead of sitting for a
further 90 minutes with the meter running) back to my hotel.</p>

<p>Would that happen in London ? Probably not.</p>
