  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just been down to
<a href="http://nbrightside.com/blog/2007/10/16/just-do-what-you-are-told-3">Asda</a>.
Not because I am a Nineties man but mainly because the element on the
kettle just blew.</p>

<p>I went fully equipped with what I believe is known as a &#8216;shopping list&#8217;.
I managed to decipher all of the entries (some were written by Norma)
and successfully secured everything. I was debating whether to pay at a
till or risk self-service where you swipe your own goods.</p>

<p>As I reviewed and cross-checked the list for a final time, I found to my
horror one solitary item unaccounted for.</p>

<p>Worse, it wasn&#8217;t Norma&#8217;s handwriting. Worse still, the final,
indeterminate item was written by me.</p>

<p>I could have left it but when you suffer from obsessive compulsive
disorder that is easier said than done. In any case, what if the item
was important ? What if the item was needed for tea tonight ?</p>

<p>I paused for thought, pushing my trolley to the side by &#8216;Chocolates and
Confectionery&#8217; and studied the shopping list intently. I still couldn&#8217;t
decipher the writing. I turned my head through 90&#8217;. Still no joy.</p>

<p>A friendly, helpful shop assistant approached. &#8216;Can I help you, Sir ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No really. It&#8217;s OK. I&#8217;m fine. Thanks. Just looking at Liquorice
Allsorts for my Dad for Christmas. He loves them, you see&#8217;.</p>

<p>&#8216;You&#8217;re not having problems reading the shopping list, your wife gave
you, are you ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;God no. Of course not. In any case, I wrote some of it.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Here - let me have a look&#8217;. I reluctantly passed the assistant the
shopping list.</p>

<p>She scrutinised the scrap of paper. &#8216;Well it can&#8217;t be that. We don&#8217;t
sell it. Nor do Sainsbury&#8217;s.&#8217; She then turned her head through 90&#8217;. &#8216;Hmm
- it sounds stupid but, honestly, that&#8217;s my best guess - &#8216;Goat&#8217;s Head&#8217;.</p>

<p>&#8216;Yeah. Thanks. That&#8217;s what I thought it was. It was probably my son
messing around. He&#8217;s a Goth, you see.</p>

<p>&#8216;Listen - do you want me to ask Eric ? He&#8217;s really good at these
handwriting puzzles.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No. Listen, it&#8217;s OK. Honestly, Thanks a lot for all your help. I&#8217;ll
just leave it for now.</p>

<p>I hurriedly made my way to a manned till as I simply dare not risk any
more potential embarrassment at the self-service tills with items that
fail to scan, causing interminable delays.</p>

<p>Phew - the ordeal is finally over. I put the shopping list back in my
pocket and start to pack the shopping.</p>

<p>As I hang a bumper pack of 24 toilet rolls onto the handy hook on back
of the trolley and prepare to pay, I hear a demented shriek: &#8216;WAIT -
DON&#8217;T LET HIM LEAVE THE STORE !&#8217;</p>

<p>The plain clothed store detective perks up and security men start to
move menacingly towards me.</p>

<p>I spot the previously helpful shop assistant sprinting towards me from
aisle 11 (Ice Cream and Frozen Vegetables), carrying something.</p>

<p>People from adjacent tills are now staring at me and I feel myself
starting to redden. The security guard is now brandishing a pair of
silver handcuffs with a worrying gleam in his eye.</p>

<p>The shop assistant finally reaches the till and triumphantly throws down
two &#8216;Go Ahead&#8217; bars (Strawberry and Fruits of the Forest).</p>

<p>&#8216;I asked Eric. He took one look and said: &#8216;Come on - this one&#8217;s obvious.
It&#8217;s not &#8216;Goat&#8217;s Head&#8217; - but &#8216;Go Ahead&#8217;.</p>

<time datetime="2008-12-02T13:18:30+00:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Dec 2<span>nd</span>, 2008</time>
        
         | <a href="/blog/2008/12/02/identica-poised-to-pounce-on-pownce/#disqus_thread">Comments</a>
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://pownce.com/">Pownce</a> (a microblogging service) has been sold to
<a href="http://www.sixapart.com/blog/2008/12/welcome-pownce-team.html">SixApart</a>
and decided to close the service on December 15 which is a nice early
Christmas present for all their users - both freeloaders (like me) and
&#8216;Pro&#8217; users who pay $20 per year.</p>

<p>Although I have a dormant Pownce <a href="http://pownce.com/andycowl/">account</a>,
I don&#8217;t actively use the service. However, I find it odd that Pownce
have decided to close the service and provide all their users with just
two weeks notice to extract all their data and find another home.</p>

<p>The Pownce
<a href="http://blog.pownce.com/2008/12/01/goodbye-pownce-hello-six-apart/">blog</a>
claims that:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;we believe we&#8217;ll come back with something much better in 2009&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>However, that &#8216;belief&#8217; must be pretty weak and the date in 2009 must be
a long way away. Otherwise, why on earth would Pownce and SixApart force
all the existing Pownce users to evaluate and migrate to alternative
services if a viable, better alternative was being planned.</p>

<p>Will those users really come running back to SixApart after being kicked
out ? When they&#8217;re already been forced to move once ? After the way
they&#8217;ve been treated ?</p>

<p>Surely, it would have been better to do what Google did with
<a href="http://www.jaiku.com/">Jaiku</a>. Absolutely nothing. Leave the service
exactly as it is with no fixes, no improvements, no additional services
or functionality. That way, the hardcore, diehard users will remain on
Pownce and, at least, you have a hope of getting those users converted
onto the new SixApart product (whenever it is available).
There are a few obvious choices for Pownce users:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> - more stability and increased uptime
recently but limited to 140 characters (unlike Pownce) and inferior
support for file sharing.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a> - probably the closest match in
terms of functionality (no 140 character limit, support for media
posts (images, links, audio, videos)</li>
<li><a href="http://friendfeed.com/">FriendFeed</a> - includes most of Pownce
functionality.</li>
<li><a href="http://identi.ca/">identi.ca</a> - micro-blogging service but
OpenSource so the opportunity exists to run a separate Laconica
instance for Pownce users and potentially support the Pownce API
(and hence all existing desktop Pownce clients).</li>
<li><a href="http://posterous.com/">Posterous</a> - supports MP3, photos, audio
files and posting by email.</li>
</ul>


<p>In fact, identi.ca have already
<a href="http://controlyourself.ca/2008/12/01/congratulations-to-pownce/">responded</a>
to the imminent demise of Pownce and started work on the ability to
import Pownce feeds into identi.ca and are actively looking for
developers to assist with providing a Pownce compatible API.</p>

<p>However, I suspect the main issues here for disillusioned Pownce users
aren&#8217;t purely technical and won&#8217;t necessarily depend on the advantages
and disadvantages of the alternative services. The key factor will
probably be the &#8216;community&#8217; which has now been suddenly and forcibly
broken up.</p>

<p>I suspect most Pownce users are on Pownce for a reason - they like the
Pownce service and they like the community they have forged on Pownce.
Consequently, I suspect a significant number will simply migrate
wherever the majority of their friends go to or maintain multiple
presences.</p>

<p>I also suspect that most Pownce users may well have already considered
(and rejected) alternatives that were around (Twitter, Tumblr,
FriendFeed) when they originally chose to sign up with Pownce which may
be another positive factor in identi.ca&#8217;s favour.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday was 1 December and an innocuous post on identi.ca about an
Advent calendar immediately reminded me of an amusing (and completely
true) blog
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/12/06/eat-your-own-dog-food">post</a>
I wrote two years ago.</p>

<p>This, in turn, prompted me to write this short
<a href="http://identi.ca/notice/1288009">note</a> on identi.ca and the post on
identi.ca subsequently
<a href="http://friendfeed.com/e/984b2ec1-2780-a624-2343-e48e197afef7/1-December-Advent-calendar-memories-still-makes/">appeared</a>
on my FriendFeed stream.</p>

<p>Normally, when I post a new blog entry, the post gets visited by a
handful of people - presumably a subset of those subscribed to this
blog. In this case, this wasn&#8217;t a new post so regular RSS readers
wouldn&#8217;t see this content so any visitors had to come from identi.ca or
FriendFeed.</p>

<p>Despite having over 150 subscribers on identi.ca and 21 &#8216;friends&#8217; on
FriendFeed, only a couple of people clicked through to the &#8216;eat your own
dog food&#8217; post when it appeared on identi.ca and FriendFeed. This isn&#8217;t
unusual (for me, at least) - the same pattern happens with any new blog
content.</p>

<p>My very good friend and Oracle colleague, the right honourable <a href="http://friendfeed.com/ontarioemperor">Emperor
of Ontario</a> (possible pseudonym
alert) had recently <a href="http://mrontemp.blogspot.com/2008/11/why-i-done-joined-reddit.html">signed
up</a>
to <a href="http://www.reddit.com/">reddit.com</a> and was curious about the viral
effect of reddit and how it might be used to help generate traffic to a
blog.</p>

<p>Ontario Emperor kindly submitted my humble blog post to Reddit under the
category &#8216;Funny&#8217;. When I became aware of this, I monitored the Web
server logs and immediately saw a lot of traffic generated from reddit.
At one point, the post reached No. 15 on Reddit&#8217;s &#8216;Funny&#8217; page and 6
people &#8216;liked&#8217; the entry.</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/97pzPFA798AvRdCKtvjeoA"><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_l2uGy1RGCiE/STUiF0v5s2I/AAAAAAAAA40/dIUaoHBARhA/s400/Reddit-Spike.PNG" alt="image" /></a>
The traffic spike was short lived (similar pattern to getting a post on
StumbleUpon). However, although the increase in traffic is interesting
and briefly satisfying, it is really not that useful for a blogger
because:</p>

<ul>
<li>Reddit generated visitors are almost always &#8216;one-hit wonders&#8217;. They
visit one page and immediately leave.</li>
<li>Reddit generated visitors are unlikely to linger on the site and
explore other content.</li>
<li>Reddit generated visitors are unlikely to comment and resurrect
conversation over a two year old post.</li>
<li>Reddit generated visitors are unlikely to subscribe to your blog.</li>
<li>Reddit generated visitors are all new visitors to your blog.
Consequently, they don&#8217;t understand the context, the author, the
history, the sense of humour or the writing style.</li>
</ul>


<p>As a brilliant example of the last point, a solitary comment was left on
the blog post by a Reddit visitor. The comment was so superlative, so
funny, so brilliant, I have chosen to reproduce it here in all its glory
to save you all the trouble of a time-consuming, pesky mouse click.</p>

<blockquote><p>why r u so cruel to your own children?</p>

<p>can u not be a little more sympathetic?</p></blockquote>

<p>You shouldn&#8217;t need to explain yourself. You shouldn&#8217;t have to put sign
posts up everywhere. You shouldn&#8217;t feel obliged to use the tag &#8216;Humour&#8217;.
You shouldn&#8217;t need to insert a plethora of emoticons just for passing
<del>visitors</del> idiots.</p>

<p>And that is why Reddit is completely useless to bloggers.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>On 8 May 2001, Leeds United played in the European Champions League Semi
Final at Valencia in Spain. I thought it might be fun to look at the
Leeds lineup for that night and see what each player is up to now.</p>

<ul>
<li>Nigel Martyn - Goalkeeping coach at Bradford City.</li>
<li>Danny Mills - on loan at Derby County, occasional pundit on BBC
Radio 5.</li>
<li>Ian Harte - on trial at Vålerenga in Norway.</li>
<li>Rio Ferdinand - first choice England centre half and captain of
Premier League and European Champions, Manchester United.</li>
<li>Dominic Matteo - playing for Stoke City in the Premiership.</li>
<li>Olivier Dacourt - playing for Inter Milan in Serie A in Italy.</li>
<li>Eirik Bakke - playing for SK Bann in Norway.</li>
<li>David Batty - runs a successful pig farm outside Malton, North
Yorkshire.</li>
<li>Harry Kewell - blighted by injury and mental weakness, now at
Galatasaray in Turkey.</li>
<li>Alan Smith - suffered horrendous ankle injury while at Manchester
United. Now struggling to even warm the bench at Newcastle.</li>
<li>Mark Viduka - classic &#8216;big time Charlie&#8217; also plying his trade
occasionally at Newcastle.</li>
<li>Paul Robinson - deposed at first choice England and Spurs keeper.
Now at Blackburn.</li>
<li>Gary Kelly - continued to serve his only club, Leeds, for 16 years
until his retirement in 2007.</li>
<li>Alan Maybury - currently a free agent after spells at Hearts,
Leicester and Aberdeen.</li>
<li>Jonathan Woodgate - astounded the footballing world by remaining
injury free and playing three games in succession for Tottenham.</li>
<li>Stephen McPhail - now playing for Cardiff City in the Championship.</li>
<li>Jacob Burns - playing for Unirea Urziceni in Romania. Son of the
lead singer of &#8216;Stiff Little Fingers&#8217;.</li>
<li>Jason Wilcox - now retired after winning 3 England caps and runs a
Judo school.</li>
</ul>


<p>Leeds United are currently lying 7th in League Division 1 (Division 3 in
old money). Ex-player Garry McAllister is now manager and remains
confident of securing promotion after missing out twice in play-off
finals in recent seasons.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Leeds lost 1-0 to non-League Histon in the second round of
the FA Cup.</p>

<p>So you see - sometimes prayers are answered and sometimes dreams do come
true.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Dear Prudence</p>

<p>That&#8217;s excellent news. I am glad to hear you have managed to get PDO
installed and now have Habari up and running on your site.</p>

<p>As for how I happened to stumble across your site, well&#8230;.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s an army of committed, passionate Habari enthusiasts who
routinely conduct Twitter, Web and blog searches for every single
mention of the word &#8216;Habari&#8217;.</p>

<p>In addition, one of the primary responsibilities of the mysterious
organisation - the <a href="http://wiki.habariproject.org/en/PMC">Cabal</a> - is to
infiltrate Government intelligence agencies worldwide (GCHQ, NSA,
Mossad, KGB) and access transcripts of all mobile phone conversations
and SMS text messages. Sophisticated AI algorithms (grep with regular
expressions) are then used to mine that data, searching for Habari
related terms.</p>

<p>Then whenever we identify anyone using Habari, we leave a &#8216;Welcome to
Habari. Enjoy the ride&#8217; comment on the blog.</p>

<p>If people are having problems, we desperately marshall all available
technical resources try to assist and claw them back from the abyss.</p>

<p>And if we discover individuals who have tried, failed, given up in
disgust and gone back to Drupal, Joomla or WordPress, well we pay them a
personal visit and shoot them :-)</p>

<p>Peace, love, empathy</p>

<p>The Habari Evangelist.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last week, I travelled to Hamburg, near Germany, on business. As Mark
Burgess (lead singer of The Chameleons) now lives there, I took the
opportunity to send an email to one of my all-time heroes (even though
he is a City fan).</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I guess Mark must be busy with his musical commitments as
I haven&#8217;t had the courtesy of a reply (yet).</p>

<blockquote><p>Hi Mark</p>

<p>Excuse the intrusion but I am coming to Hamburg tomorrow on business.
I&#8217;m staying at the SIDE hotel and need to know:</p>

<ol>
<li>Location of Sports Bar that serves Boddies or strong German lager
and will be showing MUFC versus QPR (Carling Cup).</li>
<li>Music venue with decent indie live music. My favourite bands are
The Smiths, The Fall, The Chameleons, Pixies, Nirvana, Joy
Division, Interpol, Editors, R.E.M though not necessarily in that
order. Bands doing cover versions of any of the above are
automatically excluded.</li>
<li>Decent bar where I can get a pint without being ripped off or
beaten up.</li>
</ol>


<p>PS. Enjoyed your book (which you kindly signed) a lot apart from the
last chapter that left me a bit cold.</p>

<p>Peace, love, empathy - Andy</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My support for the Disqus commenting system used on this blog is well
<a href="http://nbrightside.com/blog/2008/04/09/25-reasons-you-should-use-disqus">documented</a>.
I have also had great
<a href="http://nbrightside.com/blog/2008/08/14/in-praise-of-disqus">support</a>
whenever I have had minor issues with a service I paid precisely nothing
for.</p>

<p>Disqus are a small company with less than 10 employees. However, Disqus
are not a cottage industry operating out of Daniel Ha&#8217;s garage. Disqus
are <a href="http://www.unionsquareventures.com/2008/03/disqus.html">funded</a> by
venture capital (Union Square and angel investors) and raised $500,000
in the last round of funding (March 2008).</p>

<p>So it&#8217;s not surprising that Disqus are growing and hiring people.
However, what fascinates me is that in addition to hiring talented
developers to develop, improve, enhance and fix the product, Disqus have
recently appointed Giannii as a &#8217;<a href="http://blog.disqus.net/2008/11/19/what-is-a-communty-manager-who-is-giannii/">Community
Manager</a>&#8217;.</p>

<p>Ignoring the lack of a surname and some of the Web 2.0 terms sprinkled
in this introductory post; for example, &#8216;Chief Happiness Engineer&#8217; is
frankly cringe worthy, it is worth noting that Disqus have many channels
available for people to contact them:</p>

<ul>
<li>Twitter</li>
<li>Disqus forums</li>
<li>Email</li>
<li>GetSatisfaction</li>
</ul>


<p>More importantly, Disqus don&#8217;t just sit by the computer waiting for
people to call in - they proactively monitor all these channels and
participate. Moan about a Disqus problem on Twitter and count the
seconds until you get a response.</p>

<p>What is interesting about Disqus hiring a &#8216;Community Manager&#8217; is not
necessarily that a small startup can afford one but Disqus (and
presumably the people controlling the purse strings) actually view this
role as one of the first ten, and most important, positions to be filled
in the company.</p>

<p>So what ? Every company has a &#8216;Community Manager&#8217; - they are just called
different things &#8216;Sales&#8217;, &#8216;Marketing&#8217;, &#8216;Partners&#8217;, &#8216;Customer Care&#8217;,
&#8216;Public Relations&#8217; - every company does this stuff but they don&#8217;t a)
shout about it and b) dress it up in Web 2.0 tinsel.</p>

<p>To pick just one example, Apple are a big, successful company who make
clever videos and sell expensive, stylish computers, iPods and iPhones
to this type of demographic so surely they must have a &#8216;Community
Manager&#8217; ?</p>

<p>Surprisingly, they don&#8217;t. In September, Apple released the 2.1 firmware
for the iTouch and this update broke WPA2 wireless connectivity. Having
recently acquired an iTouch and been hugely impressed with the device, I
was surprised Apple could have introduced such a fundamental bug but I
ignored it and waited patiently for a patch.</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, lots of Apple customers experienced the same issue and
multiple threads arose to discuss the issue on Apple&#8217;s official support
forums. The most popular
<a href="http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=1703504&amp;tstart=180">thread</a>
now has 36,208 views and 436 replies.</p>

<ul>
<li>How many of the 436 replies came from Apple ? None.</li>
<li>Did Apple respond to any of these threads ? No.</li>
<li>Did Apple even acknowledge the problem ? No.</li>
<li>Do Apple care about their customers ? Not sure.</li>
<li>Am I encouraged to give more money to Apple by spending in the
iTunes Store ? No.</li>
<li>What impression does this give to a recent Apple convert ? Arrogant.</li>
<li>When is 2.2 scheduled for release ? Not known.</li>
<li>Will 2.2 include a fix for this issue ? Not known.</li>
<li>Is a fix even on the horizon ? Originally, I would have bet money on
it but, given Apple&#8217;s lack of response to date, I am now starting to
have doubts.</li>
</ul>


<p>It&#8217;s obvious that Apple don&#8217;t have a &#8216;Community Manager&#8217;. Does your
company ?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is the first in a series of &#8216;open letters&#8217; when I send emails to
people who I admire or have had a major influence on my life.</p>

<p>I will post my &#8216;open letter&#8217; and subsequently will post the individual&#8217;s
response (with their permission).</p>

<p>To kick things off, an open letter sent in February 2008 to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hawks">Tony
Hawks</a> (UK author, comedian and
occasional &#8216;talking head&#8217; on those interminable BBC series that look
back to the 1980&#8217;s).</p>

<p>Obviously, Tony has been very busy this year which must explain why I
haven&#8217;t had the common courtesy of a reply (yet).</p>

<blockquote><p>Hi Tony</p>

<p>You don&#8217;t know me (I bet a lot of your emails and fan letters start
like this) but many years ago I saw you in the reception at the Chine
Hotel in Bournemouth.</p>

<p>I recognised you, you saw me staring at you and gave me a weak,
knowing smile, probably dreading the awkward exchange that you feared
was about to happen.</p>

<p>I was considering coming up and introducing myself. However, I didn&#8217;t
for the following reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>I had this awful mental image of stuttering &#8216;Hi Tony. I&#8217;ve see you
on TV and I think you are quite funny&#8217; while you were trying to
query a mysterious charge on your hotel bill.</li>
<li>My wife has never heard of you and would wonder why I was
accosting a complete stranger at the reception desk.</li>
<li>I had to go to check on my two little children who were at loose
in the soft-play area.</li>
</ol>


<p>Anyway, I never did make it over and many years later, I still think
you are quite funny and I have just finished &#8216;Piano in the Pyrenees&#8217;
which I thoroughly enjoyed. So much so I am immediately going to buy
your other books (&#8216;Fridge Round Ireland&#8217;, &#8216;Playing Moldovans at
Tennis&#8217; and possibly &#8216;One Hit Wonder&#8217;).</p>

<p>All the best, Andy</p>

<p>PS. Tell those techies who designed your Web
<a href="http://www.tony-hawks.com/">site</a>, it doesn&#8217;t appear to work on
Firefox thus alienating a large part of your target audience.</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The
<a href="http://nbrightside.com/blog/2006/02/22/to-whom-it-may-concern">gift</a>
that simply keeps on giving.</p>

<ul>
<li>&#8216;914 scam&#8217; - if you don&#8217;t know the correct name, you may already be
doomed to failure.</li>
<li>&#8216;reasons for isolation&#8217; - spending too much time on the Internet
searching for &#8216;reasons for isolation&#8217;.</li>
<li>&#8220;craig gordon&#8221; &#8220;ian curtis&#8221; - odd combination of a dead pop star and
a living Sunderland goalkeeper.</li>
<li>&#8216;my wife&#8217;s shapely legs&#8217; - yeah right. Take those stockings off.
Now.</li>
<li>&#8221;(&#8220;current vacancy&#8221; or vacancies or opportunity or careers or
&#8220;working with&#8221; or &#8220;working for&#8221;) and (&#8220;oracle dba&#8221; or oracle dba
)and london&#8221; - with such a superlative grasp of search term syntax
and semantics, you would simply be wasted as an Oracle DBA.</li>
<li>&#8216;dead bodies in the floor boards&#8217; - stop it. You are worrying me
with the use of &#8216;in&#8217; as opposed to &#8216;under&#8217;.</li>
<li>&#8216;how to become a virgin again&#8217; - Please sit down. Have a drink. I
have some bad news for you.</li>
<li>&#8216;ian curtis hanged ice block&#8217; - Look I&#8217;ve already told you twice
This is an urban myth.</li>
<li>&#8216;make friends under 14 to 16&#8217; - try Facebook or Beebo. Just don&#8217;t
get caught.</li>
<li>&#8216;oracle killed siebel&#8217; - Mr. Ellison with the lead piping in the
library.</li>
<li>&#8216;selling strategy of siebel system anatomy&#8217; - yet another reason I
don&#8217;t work in sales.</li>
<li>&#8216;the most important decision of my entire life&#8217; - undoubtedly left
disappointed at my lack of insight.</li>
<li>&#8216;urinal pulled his zipper down&#8217; - yet another reason I always favour
a private cubicle.</li>
<li>&#8216;why durex gossamer withdrawn&#8217; - apparently on the advice of the
Pope.</li>
