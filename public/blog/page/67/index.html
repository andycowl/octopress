  <div class="entry-content"><p>When you are trying to print something in a hurry, there is nothing
worse than discovering that your work of art has just been queued behind
a monster 764 page document.</p>

<p>As you are stood by the printer wondering whether to hang around, return
to your desk or to submit the job to that printer on the fifth floor,
the printer LED displays &#8216;Attention: Out of Paper&#8217;. Naturally, there is
no paper in the print room so you go to the stationery cupboard for more
ammunition and load Trays 1, 2 and 5.</p>

<p>Excitement slowly builds as printing resumes and the job slowly advances
to page 369. Your heart sinks as the confounded LED lights up again.
Panic and manic depression set in as you see the words &#8216;Attention: Paper
Jam - Area 6C&#8217;. You press a few buttons and follow the online
diagnostics which gently lead you step by step (with pictures) to the
precise location.</p>

<p>You have to open various doors, lift various flaps and push various
plastic, purple coloured levers to perform open heart surgery on the
innards of the LaserJet. Unfortunately, you misinterpret Figure 3B and
scald your hand on that metal bar that gets as hot as a blast furnace.</p>

<p>Finally, you manage to identify the cause of the paper jam in Area 6C
and extract the offending sheet carefully. You gleefully fold it up and
consign it to the blue recycling bin and hope page 412 wasn&#8217;t that
important. You are ecstatic.</p>

<p>The 764 page document finally completes followed by a slight delay while
the printer pauses for breath. Finally your single page is ejected.
Rather inconveniently, the printer decides to switch to A3 paper just in
case the intended reader is short sighted but still.</p>

<p>You are about to triumphantly depart and soak your hand in freezing
water. The owner of &#8216;War &amp; Peace&#8217; rather conveniently arrives at the
printer to collect his tome and says &#8216;Oh is that my document ? I hope it
didn&#8217;t hold you up. Thanks a lot.&#8217;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Someone in my family was lucky enough to receive a Sony
<a href="http://www.yourpsp.com/">PSP</a> over the weekend. The Sony PSP is a fun
device. The PSP can play music. The PSP can surf the Internet. The PSP
can even view photos and DVD&#8217;s. The PSP is also pretty good as a games
console apparently.</p>

<p>The PSP is attractively styled in black although, bizarrely, my model
came with a hideous white strap and incongruous white earphones.</p>

<p>I connected the PSP to my wireless network and to my amazement, it
worked first time so I was able to upgrade the PSP software using
&#8216;Network Update&#8217;.</p>

<p>However, Web browsing is tortuous as entering text is pretty slow but
the quality of the display is excellent.</p>

<p>Oh and the lucky person wasn&#8217;t me.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am one of those 40-50 year olds who disagree with Stowe Boyd who
predicts the
<a href="http://www.stoweboyd.com/message/2006/05/hypergene_on_bu.html">death</a>
of newspapers &#8216;in the not too distant future&#8217;.</p>

<p>I like newspapers. You can take them in the garden. You can take them on
the train, bus and plane. Newspapers are ubiquitous, relatively cheap
and convenient. Yes I could pay to download selected stories to my
mobile device but I&#8217;ve tried that and it simply doesn&#8217;t work. My eyes
aren&#8217;t good enough to squint at a miniscule screen.</p>

<p>Mind you, Stowe lives in America so, when you consider the quality of
printed media (&#8216;Cat rescued from tree&#8217;) being thrown into his driveway,
maybe he does have a point after all.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t forget to check back in 10 years time to see who was right.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was travelling on a train in Stockholm today when a man walked through
the carriage selling something. Unlike London, he wasn&#8217;t flogging copies
of the &#8216;Big Issue&#8217; to feed his dog or demanding money with menaces.</p>

<p>Instead, this gentleman simply proceeded to place small cards on each
vacant seat. He did this very quietly and politely and then returned to
his original position. Despite craning my neck and desperately trying to
look at the cards while simultaneously trying to look completely
disinterested, I couldn&#8217;t actually discern what was on offer.</p>

<p>This lapse was caused by an innate fear of missing my stop and spending
another 75 minutes trapped, wandering aimlessly in the rabbit warren
that is Stockholm Central Station. However, I managed to determine that
it was either an English language school with beautiful, buxom blonde
teachers or Stockholm&#8217;s newest lap dancing bar.</p>

<p>To my amazement, after 2 minutes, the gentleman repeated his walk
through the carriage, reclaimed all of the cards which had lain
undisturbed by any passengers. He then disembarked, presumably to repeat
the exercise on another train.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For the most part, unsung and largely unnoticed at Chelsea. Simply
outstanding for Ghana against high quality opposition (Italy) yesterday.
Continually in the action, absolutely everywhere, superb fitness levels,
great tackler, decent passer, suspect temperament.</p>

<p>Essien is the tailor-made replacement for Roy Keane. United fans can
only hope Ballack&#8217;s arrival puts Essien on the bench or in the reserves
and that he won&#8217;t just sit there and take the money (cf. SWP).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>I don&#8217;t think I could have a higher opinion of any footballer than I
already had of the Irishman, but he rose even further in my estimation

the most emphatic display of selflessness I have seen on a football
field. Pounding over every blade of grass, competing if he would
rather die of exhaustion than lose he inspired all around him. I felt
it was an honour to be associated with such a player.&#8217;</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Someone recently asked me at a dinner party: &#8216;So, Norman, tell me what
you do in life ?&#8217;. I spontaneously replied: &#8216;I help people read books&#8217;.
The lady (for it was a she) exclaimed: &#8216;Oh how absolutely fabulous. You
are a teacher&#8217;. &#8216;Err, well, no. I actually work in IT&#8217;. &#8216;Oh I see. You
work in training. Why didn&#8217;t you just say so ?&#8217; &#8216;Err, well no. I am a
sort of IT consultant&#8217;.</p>

<p>Anyway, after an embarassing stony silence, thankfully I managed to
steer the conversation to the safer domain of the wide range of choices
for secondary school education in our locality. This fascinating subject
occupied us right through until the desert and coffee were served.</p>

<p>But the point I was trying to make was that Siebel and Oracle are
incredibly large, complicated, wide ranging software products. I have
worked with Siebel for three years and Oracle for a little longer but
there are still so many areas and modules in both products that I have
no practical experience of whatsoever.</p>

<p>I remember once reading <a href="http://tkyte.blogspot.com/">Tom Kyte</a> stating
that he did not have access to the Oracle source code nor did he did not
have a hotline to RDBMS engineering. The basis of his wealth of
extensive Oracle knowledge was primarily the documentation set. I
remember being hugely impressed by this simple statement. [ Sorry I did
look but failed to locate the reference ]</p>

<p>I am a Siebel &#8216;consultant&#8217; trying to help people use Siebel more
effectively. Most of the information needed to help customers use Siebel
more effectively is actually contained in the documentation. The only
problem is that the &#8216;documentation&#8217; is simply overwhelming as it
includes the manuals, FAQ&#8217;s, Alerts, Release Notes, Service Requests etc
etc.</p>

<p>I have a couple of advantages: Firstly, I am continually exposed to a
wide variety of different Siebel related issues day after day so I so
have a degree of experience of real-world problems (and hopefully the
resolution).</p>

<p>Secondly, and more importantly, I do have access to a network of highly
talented, intelligent individuals with far more experience and
intelligence than yours truly. Now this wouldn&#8217;t be an advantage unless
that group of people were prepared to share their knowledge and I am
pleased to say that they are. This isn&#8217;t necessarily true at all
companies I have worked for.</p>

<p>Normally, I lug my heavy laptop, hanging over my shoulder, attached to
my body like a young helpless infant, all around Europe. Today I was in
Stockholm and the weather was unusually hot (30&#8217;C). To reach the office,
I had to take a train and a tube in the morning rush hour. Consequently,
I left the laptop behind in the hotel and arrived onsite free from back
pain and feeling blissfully liberated.</p>

<p>I told the customer that we would purely be using the public
documentation that is freely available to me and him. No hidden
cheat-sheets, no private internal emails, no top tips from engineering.
He was impressed (I think).</p>

<p>Then, of course, inevitably, we hit a very obtuse, bizarre problem,
neither of us had encountered before so it was time to make another call
on that network.</p>
