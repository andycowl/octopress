  <div class="entry-content"><p>This <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/70276096@N00/403356821/">sign</a> in my
hotel room intrigued me. Every time I entered the bathroom, I gazed at
the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/70276096@N00/403356821/">sign</a>. I
found myself entering the bathroom to study the sign when I didn&#8217;t
actually need to use the bathroom.</p>

<p>Was the pipe hot or not ? Unfortunately, this towel rail wasn&#8217;t listed
anywhere on this <a href="http://hotornot.com/">site</a>. Could the temperature
really be as high as 140&#8217; F ? How hot is 140&#8217; F ?</p>

<p>Finally, just before I checked out, I gave in to temptation, removed the
towels and grabbed the silver rail with my right hand.</p>

<p>The appliance was indeed hot, very hot, dangerously hot. Scaldingly hot,
in fact.</p>

<p>I stretched my left arm to reach outside the bathroom door around to my
laptop on the desk. I then somehow managed to type with my left hand and
agonisingly Googled to find out how exactly long I could endure this
torture before incurring a third degree burn.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.med.umich.edu/1libr/pa/pa_hotwatr_hhg.htm">answer</a> - 6
seconds. Unfortunately, thanks to my restricted movement and the
agonising pain, it took me a full 45 seconds to discover this vital
fact.</p>

<p>Finally, I could bear it no longer so I released my right hand and sunk
it under the blissful sanctuary of the cold water tap at full blast.</p>

<p>I slowly gathered my bags, proceeded to check out (left handed) and told
the receptionist that my lawyers would be in touch.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Thank you for your email. I am currently working in a bunker deep
underground in the heart of Brussels (near Belgium).</p>

<p>I would normally say &#8216;Please call me directly on my mobile&#8217;. However,
this secure facility is so secure that no mobile communications are
possible.</p>

<p>I would normally pledge to replying to your email on my return. However,
I am not quite sure precisely when (or even indeed, if) I ever will
return. While I am not literally chained to the desk, the security
officer is holding my passport which fills me with a sense of unease and
practically equates to the same thing.</p>

<p>The working environment is not ideal. Massive ceiling mounted fans in a
server room make for a cool, uncomfortable and noisy environment. Still,
this is my punishment for living in an ivory tower far divorced from
reality, waving my arms about and drawing architecture diagrams on a
whiteboard and I must accept it.</p>

<p>This particular customer insisted that, as a followup to a recent
architecture workshop, I return in person to install, configure and test
what I foolishly claimed was &#8216;straightforward and trivial&#8217;.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This <a href="http://ocaoimh.ie/2007/02/20/writing-perl-the-vista-way/">post</a>
put me in a quandry. I found the video very amusing so I was torn
between leaving a grateful comment on <a href="http://ocaoimh.ie/">Donncha</a>&#8217;s
blog and awarding the article a (Gold) &#8216;Star&#8217; in Google Reader.</p>

<p>But if I only did that, my friend and a couple of (ex-) colleagues who
might appreciate the joke may miss it. That would be very selfish.
Forgive me Father, but briefly, I toyed with reverting to Web 0.1 (beta)
and sending an mass email to &#8216;Friends/Ex Colleagues&#8217;.</p>

<p>I compromised by posting an article on my blog referring to Donncha&#8217;s
article so he sees the pingback and gets the credit for spotting the
video. So Donncha&#8217;s happy, I&#8217;m happy, everyone&#8217;s happy.</p>

<p>Well - not exactly because I had to write some additional words on my
article to justify its existence. This is
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/02/18/resisting-the-lure-of-google-reader/">exactly</a>
the situation that Google Shared Items is for.</p>

<blockquote><p>These items might be interesting or useful snippets of information
quickly noted in passing which I wouldn&#8217;t necessarily blog about.</p></blockquote>

<p>I just want to display a RSS feed on my blog for articles like this that
I find interesting, amusing or thought provoking.
This is trivial to implement in WordPress so I simply grab the feed URL
for &#8216;Shared Items&#8217; from Google Reader and create an RSS widget to
display &#8216;What I am currently reading&#8217; on the sidebar in this blog.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, that didn&#8217;t work. The feed and article names were
displayed but the formatting of the links was broken on WordPress 2.1.
Curiously, I tried the same configuration on a test
<a href="http://nbrightside.wordpress.com/">blog</a> on hosted Wordpress and it
worked fine.</p>

<p>A little research revealed that the WordPress RSS widget does not appear
to
<a href="http://en.forums.wordpress.com/topic.php?id=1249&amp;replies=11#post-6531">support</a>
Atom 1.0 format (which is precisely the format used by Google Shared
Items).</p>

<p>No problem. Just create a <a href="http://www.feedburner.com">Feedburner</a> feed
and see if that works. This should automatically, dynamically and
intelligently convert the feed format into a format the recipient can
digest. Unfortunately, it doesn&#8217;t. Sigh. Give up in disgust and make a
note to ask in the WordPress/Reader forums.</p>

<p>Only you can&#8217;t give up. You want this to work and this is now a
challenge.</p>

<p>Read the Feedburner
<a href="http://forums.feedburner.com/viewforum.php?f=7&amp;sid=6a8a899de22627714719f9a4565fe228">FAQ</a>
which implies that SmartBurner is what you need. This automatically,
converts the original feed format for the consumer on the fly. However,
SmartBurner is enabled by default so I wonder why it isn&#8217;t working.</p>

<p>Examine the configuration of SmartBurner. By default, the output feed
preserves the format of the original feed (Atom 1.0 in this case).
However, it is easy to force conversion to different format (RSS 2.0) by
setting the &#8216;Content-Type&#8217;.</p>

<p>Revisit the WordPress RSS widget. Success !</p>

<p>So, after all that time and effort, I sincerely hope you both enjoy my
&#8216;Gooogle Shared Items&#8217; feed.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When I returned from evensong last night, after I had ironed five shirts
and read a bedtime story to my loving (but strangely uncommunicative)
teddy bears, I sat down with a hot cup of Horlicks to enjoy two hours of
high quality Sunday night viewing.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know why but I have always had an interest in &#8216;conspiracy
therories&#8217;. When I was a lad, I was convinced that</p>

<ul>
<li>Marilyn Monroe was killed by the Kennedy brothers.</li>
<li>Ashley Grimes was a undercover Manchester City spy.</li>
<li>JFK was assasinated by Norma Jeane Mortenson from the grassy knoll.</li>
<li>UFO&#8217;s had landed at Roswell and probably deposited Ashley Grimes.</li>
</ul>


<p>Of course, that was then. This is now. Back then I was a boy. Now I am a
man (sort of). With the passing years, I have matured and changed my
beliefs accordingly.</p>

<ul>
<li>9/11 was instigated by the US government in order to invade
Afghanistan and Iraq.</li>
<li>Lady Diana (Princess Of Our Hearts) was assasinated by an Italian
Pizza chef, driving a white Fiat Punto on the orders of Prince
Phillip (The Greek).</li>
<li>Kurt Cobain&#8217;s death was directly or indirectly arranged by Courtney
Love.</li>
</ul>


<p>Imagine my horror, when last night&#8217;s BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/conspiracy_files/6160775.stm">Conspiracy
Files</a>
tells me that 9/11 was the work of Al Qaeda terrorist cells coupled with
failings by the US intelligence services.</p>

<p>This revelation shocked me. I was stunned. I was struggling to
assimilate this bombshell which opened to question so many of my dearly
held beliefs. To ease the pain, I poured the Horlicks down the sink and
cracked open a Grolsch.</p>

<p>I quickly switched channels to FA Cup Match of The Day in an effort to
restore a sense of normality. Another conspiracy - Manchester City had
avoided an FA Cup giant-killing and beaten Preston.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s it. I can&#8217;t take any more. I am going to bed. Only I couldn&#8217;t. I
had to stay up to watch another deep, probing, investigative BBC program
to finally which would surely prove that I am not clinically insane and
confirm (or at least keep faintly alive) just one of my conspiracy
theories.</p>

<p>Unfortunately,&#8217;The last 48 hours of Kurt Cobain&#8217; proposed the ridiculous
assertion that Kurt Cobain was a manic depressive, heroin addict in
denial with wild mood swings, depressed at his sought after fame and
cult status, desperate to escape an unhappy marriage but simultaneously
petrified of being denied access to his two year old daughter.</p>

<p>After another brief and unsuccessful attempt in rehab, Cobain embarked
on yet another drug binge in Seattle before penning a suicide note and
shooting himself in the head with a shotgun.</p>

<p>So the fact that Cobain&#8217;s body had massive amounts of heroin that would
have rendered him incapable of pulling the trigger, the fact that
another hand wrote the closing line &#8216;Please keep going Courtney, for
Frances&#8217; and the curious fact that Cobain carefully tidied away his drug
paraphernalia when dead are all just examples of yet another conspiracy
theory.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am a big fan of
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/05/25/good-vibes-from-netvibes/">Netvibes</a>
but also follow the ongoing
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/01/06/google-reader-adds-stats-on-rss-habits/">development</a>
of Google
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/09/28/google-reader-gets-revamp/">Reader</a>
with interest. Increasingly, I find myself tempted to convert to
<a href="http://www.google.com/help/reader/help.html">Reader</a> permanently.</p>

<ul>
<li>Speed - Google Reader has a set of keyboard shortcuts that make
scanning a large number of feeds quick. Really quick. While Netvibes
also offers keyboard
<a href="http://eco.netvibes.com/help/keyboard">shortcuts</a>, out of habit, I
tend to use mouse-clicks to navigate between tabs and articles.</li>
<li>Flexibility - You can read related blogs that are grouped together
(e.g. Oracle, Wordpress), read an individual blog or quickly skim
over a river of news.</li>
<li>Sharing - Occasionally, I want to save an article for future
reference or potentially sharing with others. These items might be
interesting or useful snippets of information quickly noted in
passing which I wouldn&#8217;t necessarily blog about. The most obvious
place to mark these items is right here in the RSS reader as opposed
to a static bookmark. The list should (obviously) be visible as an
RSS feed. Google&#8217;s shared and starred items make this easy (single
keystroke).</li>
<li>Flexible interface - I really like the full screen mode and the
options for &#8216;list view&#8217; where articles are condensed apart from the
current article and &#8216;expanded view&#8217; (all articles are expanded).</li>
<li>Statistics - I can&#8217;t decide whether the trends page about your
personal reading habits may actually be useful or just a gimmick.</li>
</ul>


<p>Here&#8217;s a Flickr
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/70276096@N00/sets/72157594542180535/detail/">set</a>
of annotated screenshots to illustrate the functionality in Google
Reader and the flexibility of the interface.
I think the recent addition of
<a href="http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2007/02/one-subscriber-two-subscribers-three.html">subscriber</a>
counts to Google Reader will show that Reader has a substantial and
rapidly growing share of the RSS reader market. Stowe
<a href="http://www.stoweboyd.com/message/2007/02/big_spike_in_fe.html">Boyd</a>
and Tom
<a href="http://www.tomrafteryit.net/1000-subscribers-and-no-free-pint/">Raftery</a>
are already noting a Feedburner
<a href="http://blogs.feedburner.com/feedburner/archives/2007/02/the_google_effect.php">spike</a>
as a result.</p>

<p>Interestingly, Darren Rowse notes that subscribers from Google
Reader/Desktop/IG already heavily
<a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2007/02/18/google-reader-starts-reporting-subscriber-numbers-and-shows-how-much-ground-theyve-taken-from-bloglines/">outnumber</a>
the established and popular Bloglines reader.</p>

<p>Looking forward, one feature I would really like to see in Google Reader
is feed discovery and recommendations based on readers with common
interests and similar reading lists.</p>

<a href="http://mail.google.com/mail/">Gmail</a> which both do such a sterling job
of automatically detecting spam.</p>

<p>Anyway, it turns out Blueyonder do have a spam filtering capability. If
you log onto Webmail, under Options, there is a section called
&#8216;Anti-spam and Antivirus Preferences&#8217;.</p>

<p>Make sure the &#8216;Enable Spam Checking&#8217; box is checked. You can alter the
default spam sensitivity to be &#8216;High&#8217; and set the option to tag the
email subject with [SPAM].</p>

<p>Then you can create a message filter in Outlook Express or Thunderbird
to automatically dump such messages to a separate folder for periodic
review.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday afternoon at 16:09, in Surrey, a sales rep in a red Vauxhall
Vectra shunted a plumber driving a white van on the middle lane of the
M25. Twenty years ago, the following cars would have quickly stopped to
allow the protagonists to pull over to the hard shoulder.</p>

<p>Twenty years ago, a heated exchange would ensue. Then both parties would
calm down and exchange insurance details. Twenty years ago, the white
van driver would resume his journey while the Vectra owner waited for a
tow from The AA to a local garage to replace his pierced radiator.</p>

<p>In 2007, Surrey Traffic Police handle minor traffic incidents very
differently. The busiest motorway in England is completely closed while
Surrey Traffic Police determine precisely how many lanes need to be
closed in order to handle this earth shattering incident.</p>

<p>Eventually, after 19 minutes analysis involving 7 officers and a Chief
Superintendent, Surrey Traffic Police decide that, in the interests of
public safety, just two lanes need to be closed so the outer lane is
slowly re-opened on Britain&#8217;s busiest motorway. This is now the start of
the rush-hour so the queues are building fast but Surrey Traffic Police
are completely oblivious to this element of the unfolding drama.</p>

<p>Surrey Traffic Police continue to call for reinforcements from other
regions while they carefully and thoroughly evaluate this very dangerous
situation. Both drivers are instructed to remain in their vehicles while
paramedics are summoned. Counsellors are invited to diagnose and remedy
post-traumatic stress disorder.</p>

<p>Chemical engineers are dispatched from a secret government research
laboratory to conduct experiments on the liquid spilled on to the
carriageway. A high priority call to building contractors is made in
case the roadway surface needs to be replaced which would mean a very
welcome overnight closure (and overtime). A newly qualified cone
engineer arrives to check no plastic cones have been damaged.</p>

<p>Early evening is the height of the rush-hour. The tailback is now 6
miles in both directions and growing. The M3, A30 and surrounding roads
are now also affected. Four hours after the original incident, 8pm sees
a shift change for Surrey Traffic Police. Three policemen volunteer for
overtime to see this major incident through to a successful conclusion.
Another decides he will miss Dragon&#8217;s Den so fires up the siren and
speeds off at 70 mph down the hard shoulder.</p>

<p>The chemical engineer decides the liquid from the car radiator is water
with a small element of anti-freeze. Surrey Traffic Police decide to
wait a further 25 minutes to let the luke warm water cool down. The
driver is cautioned and a sample of windscreen washer fluid is sent for
analysis.</p>

<p>All three lanes of the motorway are now completely gridlocked so,
unsurprisingly, The AA recovery vehicle can not get through. Surrey
Traffic Police decide to use their powers to expedite the situation and
summon their own recovery vehicles instead. Due to operational
difficulties, they are summoned from Birmingham.</p>

<p>Eventually, at 21:15, the middle lane is carefully re-opened and a
trickle of traffic starts to flow. A policeman makes calming gestures to
the impatient drivers and is met with a volley of V-signs.</p>

<p>After another two hours, the motorway is fully re-opened and the UK can
breathe again. Thanks to Surrey Traffic Police for averting yet another
major traffic incident and keeping Britain&#8217;s roads safe.</p>

<p>Last year, I went to Norway and was enjoying a scenic five hour drive
from Bergen to the fjords through a multitude of dark, narrow, winding
tunnels carved through solid rock. Suddenly, the traffic came to a halt
shortly before the entrance to another tunnel</p>

<p>To my horror, I could make out a collision between a car and a coach
with a solitary policeman in attendance. As I waited, I consulted my
Phillips Map of Europe; when this tunnel was closed, we would have to
make a diversion which would turn a pleasant scenic 5 hour drive into a
nightmare, 12 hour drive.</p>

<p>After 7 minutes, a breakdown truck arrived and towed the car out of the
tunnel. The coach then exited the tunnel and parked in a layby. The
policeman ran (take note Surrey Traffic Police - yes he ran) to his
patrol car, fetched a brush, ran (yes ran) into the tunnel and
frantically brushed debris and glass to the side.</p>

<p>As he emerged from the tunnel, he frantically waved his brush at cars
and lorries to get moving quickly in an effort to get the traffic
flowing again as soon as humanly possible.</p>
