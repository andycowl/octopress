  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am working in Oxford and booked into this small
<a href="http://www.happylodge.org.uk/">hotel</a> overnight. I arrived at 18.30 and
rang the bell. No one is home.</p>

<p>I phoned the company who made the booking to get the phone number. They
call the hotel on my behalf. Guess what. No one is home.</p>

<p>The helpful man from <a href="http://www.laterooms.com/">LateRooms</a> asked if I
could wait around in the cold for 30 minutes to &#8216;see if someone turns
up&#8217;.</p>

<p>I was convinced my ears had deceived me and asked him to repeat this
suggestion. I politely decline his kind offer so he consults his
supervisor and offers to find me another hotel.</p>

<p>I reply that I wouldn&#8217;t trust him to tell me the time of day and hang
up. I then drive aimlessly around Kidlington until I happen to locate
the <a href="http://www.ichotelsgroup.com/h/d/hi/925/en/hd/ofduk">Holiday Inn</a>.
Thankfully, this hotel has a person manning reception and rooms
available.</p>

<p>Later, the proprietor of the Happy Lodge calls me to explain the
situation. Not to apologise but just to explain the situation.</p>

<p>When I made the booking, I indicated I would be arriving around 19.00 so
that is when someone would have been around to greet me. So it was
actually my fault all along. Of course, I see now. Everything is crystal
clear. It was my mistake. How stupid of me.</p>

<p>The proprietor thinks I owe her an apology because she had to turn a
couple away from booking the room allocated to me but now unexpectedly
vacant at short notice.</p>

<p>I disagreed and politely suggested that maybe, just maybe, she might owe
me an apology.</p>

<p>The lady disagreed but helpfully suggested that next time I stay at the
Happy Lodge, I make an effort to arrive at the designated time and not
half an hour earlier.</p>

<p>I count to two and half before exploding: &#8216;Sorry but there will be no
need for that because I will not be staying at the Happy Lodge. Not
tonight. Not tomorrow. Not next week. Not ever&#8217;.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Bluehost have upgraded WordPress to 2.0.5 so I ignored this warning and
clicked &#8216;Upgrade&#8217;</p>

<blockquote><p>Click on Upgrade only if\
 - no files, languages, themes have been modified\
 - you haven&#8217;t added mods to this installation of WordPress</p></blockquote>

<p>After all, the whole point of hosting a blog is to add
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/10/16/couple-of-useful-wordpress-plugins/">plugins</a>
and
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/10/10/improving-on-perfection/">modify</a>

<p>I find it slightly odd that Bluehost have no blog or other means of
communicating the availability of these upgrades.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s see if posting still works.</p>

your suitcase when attending a week long conference away from home.</p>

<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/04/18/birth-of-a-photo-blog/">blog</a>
has now been restored to its full
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/05/08/lwtua/">glory</a>.</p>

<p>Yesterday, I visited a customer in sunny Glasgow, near Scotland. This
was very poor planning on my part. I really should have delayed this
trip by 7 days which would have allowed me to gatecrash the Oracle
blogger
<a href="http://www.rittman.net/2006/10/18/blogger-meetup-ukoug-conference-tuesday-november-14th/">meet-up</a>
at UKOUG.</p>

<p>In addition, returning to Glasgow on Tuesday 21 November would have
given me the opportunity to watch Celtic play United in a atmospheric
Glasgow hostelry sharing a pint of &#8216;heavy&#8217; with some friendly Scottish
people.</p>

<p>Anyway, it&#8217;s all about the customer so I flew up yesterday. As I landed,
I saw a small charter plane on the runway, ferrying a group of Scottish
Oracle bloggers to Birmingham. I knew it was a group of Oracle DBA&#8217;s
from the name of the <a href="http://flydba.com/">airline</a>.</p>

<p>When I arrived at the office, the client was having a theme week to
coincide with &#8216;I&#8217;m a (C-list) Celebrity. Get me out of here.&#8217; The lifts
were out of action and you had to clamber up a large
<a href="http://flickr.com/photos/70276096@N00/297978033/">beanstalk</a> to get to
the meeting room on the fourth floor.</p>

<p>Scaling the beanstalk was quite a challenge and you had to acrobatically
leap onto a slippery white pole before finally reaching the balcony.
This task delayed the start of the architecture workshop by two hours
but the
<a href="http://flickr.com/photos/70276096@N00/297978031/in/photostream/">view</a>
from the top was well worth it.</p>

<p>We then adjourned for a delightful lunch of widgety grubs, fish eyes and
kangaroo testicles. Strange people, the Scots.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I never used to work from home much. When the kids were younger, my wife
was at home and without an office, quiet room or even a shed, I found it
difficult to concentrate. Accessing the work network over dial-up also
was a significant constraint.</p>

<p>Now things are different. My children are both at secondary school and
leave the house before I do. My wife also works and I have a broadband
connection and VPN access to the office network. So, occasionally, I can
save two hours commuting, sit down with a decent cup of tea, be
productive and still be back home in time for tea.</p>

<p>Apart from today, that is. My wife isn&#8217;t working today but worse than
that, a pet hamster has effected a miraculous escape overnight. I had
noticed that he was looking deeply upset after United&#8217;s shock defeat at
Southend and chewing frantically at the bars but I never thought he
would do anything like this.</p>

<p>The rodent is now on the loose so all floor fittings have been detached
and every dark nook and cranny has been examined with a high powered
flashlight.</p>

<p>Of course, the hamster hasn&#8217;t been found. He probably got too
inquisitive and is starving to death somewhere under the floorboards.
That is, if he managed to avoid the mouse poison.</p>

<p>So the search is called off (by me) and suspended by my wife who has
gone to share the terrible news with friends over an overpriced
Cappuccino.</p>

<p>Peace at last. Until my daughter sends me a text &#8216;found him yet ?&#8217;.
Plagued by guilt, I get a torch out and scan under the furniture and
fireplace yet again. Then I put his cage on the floor with a tasty
pumpkin seed placed outside to tempt him back to his metal prison.</p>

<p>Peace at last. Back to what I should be working on. Music on. Oh no, I
forgot. No music is allowed as I am supposed to be listening for
hamster-like rustling noises. Funny how the washing machine is exempt
from this noise curfew.</p>

<p>Peace at last. Knock at the front door. Some delivery from Next. Sign.
Thanks.</p>

<p>Peace at last. Another knock at the door. Two female religious nuts who,
thankfully (for their sake) decide not to preach at me for ten minutes
but instead just push a leaflet into my hand titled &#8216;THE END OF FALSE
RELIGION IS NEAR !&#8217; with the intriguing bullet points</p>

<ul>
<li>What is false religion ?</li>
<li>How will it end ?</li>
<li>How will you be affected ?</li>
</ul>


<p>This is clearly a sign from God. I tell the ladies that my wife is out,
I have the house all to myself and the kettle has just boiled. I invite
them in and ask whether they are qualified to officiate over a funeral
for a hamster. Curiously, they look aghast and leave. Maybe I shouldn&#8217;t
have flicked my dressing gown so wide open.</p>

<p>Finally, peace at last. Check my email. Curiously, I have a voicemail
from my office extension. This is strange because hardly anyone has
access to this number. I can never remember it without looking at my
business card. My wife doesn&#8217;t know it and hardly anyone I know has ever
used it.</p>

<p>I play the WAV that is consuming 500KB of disk space. Inevitably, it is
a recruitment consultant who &#8216;has spoken to some people who know me very
well, think very highly of me and just happen to think I might just be
interested in some vacuous pre-sales role dealing with some of the
biggest blue chip companies in, not just the UK, but Europe.&#8217; Thanks but
no thanks. Delete the message and return to the document I should be
writing.</p>

<p>Peace at last. Until the telephone rings. Some direct marketeer brings
me tidings of great joy. My wife and I have won a Christmas Hamper. I am
immediately suspicious and ask if this is surplus stock
from<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/wiltshire/6115626.stm">Farepak</a>.
She assures me that it isn&#8217;t and tells me that my wife and I just need
to come to a local hotel on Saturday to collect this hamper.</p>

<p>I ask why they can&#8217;t just send it. Because I have to collect it with my
wife. Can&#8217;t my wife just pop over and collect it ? No. My wife and I
must both collect it. Why - is the hamper really that heavy ? No. I ask
if there is any type of &#8216;presentation&#8217; involved. No there isn&#8217;t. It is
just a free Christmas hamper. What&#8217;s in the hamper ? I can&#8217;t tell you.
Finally, I say I am not interested and hang up.</p>

<p>Wife returns. She asks whether Julia has called to confirm the
appointment about the Christmas Hamper. I tell her the bad news. She
then asks whether I have heard any hamster-like noises and I tell her
more bad news. No hamster-like rustlings but plenty of interruptions.</p>

<p>I finally give up. I put a collared shirt on, and drive to the office.
Peace at last.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A few years ago, on a Saturday morning, I was crossing the road to the
local shop with my daughter, Norma Jean. We held hands to cross halfway
and paused. Suddenly, spontaneously, without warning, Norma Jean decided
to burst across the road.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, a car simultaneously decided to sharply turn left without
indicating. It all happened quickly - very quickly. The car ran over
Norma&#8217;s foot and she collapsed. The car stopped and the lady pleaded:
&#8216;Oh God. I didn&#8217;t see her. I didn&#8217;t see her. I&#8217;m sorry. She just ran
out.&#8217;</p>

<p>I picked my daughter up in my arms and ran home. Her face was ashen
white. Mine was red. I was in shock. I was nearly in tears. My wife, a
nurse, calmly took stock of the situation and asked: &#8216;Did you remember
to get the cornflakes ?&#8217;. We skipped breakfast and immediately went to
casualty. Thankfully, my daughter&#8217;s ankle wasn&#8217;t broken, just badly
bruised. Well a very heavy car had ran over it so that diagnosis wasn&#8217;t
entirely unexpected.</p>

<p>A couple of years later, I returned home from work on a balmy summer
evening and a neighbour informed me: &#8216;Oh Norma&#8217;s just taken Norma Jean
to hospital. You might catch them if you&#8217;re quick&#8217;. I arrived in
casualty to discover that Norma Jean had jumped off the front wall
wearing pink flip-flops and &#8216;hurt her arm&#8217;. Well, the truth was she had
broken her arm close to the elbow and, if you looked really close, you
could see the bare bone.</p>

<p>We waited patiently to be seen. My daughter was ashen white. She was in
shock. My wife asked for some painkillers for Norma Jean while we waited
and waited. When the nurse came over and briefly glanced at the injury,
she quickly said &#8216;Err - I think you had better come through to see the
consultant. Now.&#8217;</p>

<p>In the early hours, a clever, experienced surgeon repaired my daughter&#8217;s
arm. I was at home all night wide awake. I visited the hospital in the
morning and the consultant reassured me thus: &#8216;I have been an orthopedic
surgeon for 23 years and that was the second most difficult fracture, I
have ever seen.&#8217; I nearly fainted so I neglected to ask him about the
nature of the award winning injury.</p>

<p>Thankfully, Norman Jean made a full recovery and was able to resume her
sporting activities although wall jumping in flip-flops was banned.</p>

<p>My third visit to the casualty unit came when my son was forced to take
his turn in goal during a normal Sunday morning for U10&#8217;s Little League.
Norman Junior III dived to his right and turned a pile-driver around the
post (traffic cone) for a corner. Not a bad effort for a midfield
player.</p>

<p>I continued to follow the play upfield but another parent interrupted
me: &#8216;Is your lad OK ?&#8217;. I looked back towards to the goalmouth and
Norman was gingerly holding his arm. I reluctantly walked over and he
said &#8216;Dad - my arm really hurts.&#8217; I told him to grit his teeth, think of
Bert Trautmann and just get through 5 minutes to half-time when he would
be an outfield player again.</p>

<p>At half-time, he was now squatting down, holding his arm, in tears. &#8216;My
arm still really hurts, Dad&#8217;. Ashamedly, I made my excuses and took my
son home, leaving his team down to ten men in a crucial end of season
game. Norma forced him to put his kit in the washing machine, have a
shower, asked him to finish his History homework and finally dosed him
up with Calpol.</p>

<p>At tea time, Norman Junior III didn&#8217;t eat his tea and was obviously
spoiling to miss school on Monday. Very inconvenient as both of us are
working. &#8216;But Mum - my arm still really hurts.&#8217; So we decided to call
his bluff, even though it meant missing &#8216;Antiques Roadshow&#8217; and prepared
for yet another long wait in casualty.</p>

<p>We were mortified to be told he had a &#8216;green stick&#8217; fracture of his
right arm from saving a shot. We were even more mortified when trying to
explain to the social worker why we didn&#8217;t bring him to hospital for a
full 8 hours after the original incident. We were even more mortified
when she asked if we had ever had reason to bring either of our children
to hospital in the past 5 years.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here is a series of email exchanges I had with Mark Burgess in late
1998. I converted the original text to HTML and corrected a couple of
minor typos.</p>

<p><em>I&#8217;m a great fan of The Chameleons and recently was sad enough to
transcribe a few quotes from bootlegs and put them on the Web.</em></p>

<p>Interesting, I&#8217;ll check it out next time I&#8217;m online.</p>

<p><em>Were you a big fan of The Fall ? I just love the bit where you sing
&#8216;Rowche Rumble&#8217; in &#8216;Splitting in Two&#8217;.</em></p>

<p>Yes I&#8217;ve always been a big fan of The Fall, since 1976 through all their
many incarnations, my favourite being Mark Smith, Marc Riley, Una
Baines, Karl Burns and Martin Bramah.</p>

<p><em>Was the dig about &#8216;Bleak and industrial we&#8217;re not and never will be&#8217;
aimed at anyone in particular ? A Certain Ratio, Joy Division ? Those
stupid bands from Sheffield who used to bang oil drums ?</em></p>

<p>No not really, it was something that was being said about us in reviews.</p>

<p><em>What was &#8216;Paradiso&#8217; about ? It&#8217;s one of my favourites together with
Soul in Isolation (heard about the Jack London book) and &#8216;Splitting&#8217;.</em></p>

<p>At the time I did Paradiso I wasn&#8217;t sure, I just thought, shit, that&#8217;s a
weird one, where did that come from But later I realised that it focused
on my experiences of Amsterdam and it kind of paints a Soddam and
Gommorah picture of it.</p>

<p><em>God, it really was you.</em></p>

<p>Please don&#8217;t call me God, plain Mark will do&#8230;</p>

<p><em>Yeah - since I mailed you I read an interview on &#8216;Home is Where The
Heart Is&#8217; where you list all your musical influences.</em></p>

<p>What&#8217;s &#8216;Home Is Where The Heart Is&#8217;?</p>

<p><em>I saw The Fall many times and have got tons of their bootlegs. Haven&#8217;t
seen them in years though.</em></p>

<p>No me neither, actually Karen Latham, who WAS to be our Bass player in
&#8216;Invincible&#8217; has decided to join The Fall instead, funny how things turn
out isn&#8217;t it?</p>

<p><em>Were you a fan of The Smiths ? Used to go and see them a lot too.</em></p>

<p>Yeah, I&#8217;ve been going through a phase recently of playing all those
records again, they still sound great.</p>

<p><em>I going to *have* to get the tape with the cover of Buzzcocks&#8217;
&#8216;Breakdown&#8217; now.</em></p>

<p>Yeah you know someone asked me about that once and I was saying &#8220;nah, we
never covered that&#8221; and then he pulled the cassette out and played it. I
have no memory of it what so ever.</p>

<p><em>Also we used to have drunken rows about whether &#8216;Paper Tigers&#8217; was
written about &#8216;Killing Joke&#8217; - I don&#8217;t remember where it originated -
any truth to that one ?</em></p>

<p>Yeah a little bit, we were down to support them once in Leicester, they
turned up 4 hours late for their sound check so when it came to our turn
their crew jerked us around, a two minute job, and the band were all
standing at the side of the stage when we started shouting about it, so
me and Dave ran at them with our guitars and they legged it back to
their dressing room. We pulled out of the gig. They came and said sorry
later and wanted us to do the rest of the tour but we told them to
f**k off.</p>

<p><em>I think all this obsession with lyrics and what bands thought of each
other was interlinked with the MUFC/Liverpool scouse football rivalry
(violence) and the fact the Mark E. Smith kept slagging the Bunnymen and
the Crucial Three off in interviews. Also The Passage wrote &#8216;A Certain
Way To Go&#8217; which was definitely about ACR.</em></p>

<p>Ah The Passage, another of my all time favourite bands.</p>

<p><em>I guess you probably find people still obsessed by The Chameleons as
irritating as requests for &#8216;In Shreds&#8217; but still&#8230;</em></p>

<p>No I&#8217;m not the slightest bit irritated, the only time it bugs me is when
the media go on about Chameleons when you&#8217;re trying to get something new
across, in interviews or on the radio or something. But generally I&#8217;m
very proud of all the stuff I&#8217;ve done.</p>

<p><em>Thanks a lot for taking the time to reply.</em></p>

<p>No problem, bye for now.</p>

<p><em>I once saw a gig in Camden once where your voice was f**ked and some
lads from the audience got up for their 5 minutes of fame but the show
was abandoned.</em></p>

<p>Yeah I remember that gig, it was really bad &#8216;cause a Geffen Rep had
flown in specially to check out the band and I was miffed &#8216;cause Johnny
Marr had come down to see us&#8230;.</p>

<p>It happened again years later with The Sun And The Moon, a gig for
Children In Need. Again I invited someone up from the audience and this
lad got up and not only did he know all the words but he sounded so like
me it was SPOOKY&#8230;</p>

<p><em>I&#8217;ve also got bootlegs where you refer to problems with &#8216;my voice going
again&#8217;.</em></p>

<p>Yeah and it was ages before I sussed out what the problem was, it turned
out to be air conditioning, whenever I shared a room or a car with AC my
throat would dry up and my voice would go.</p>

<p><em>Did Dave/Reg/anyone else ever do vocals ?</em></p>

<p>Dave used to do backing vocals, but it got so that he&#8217;d have moods,
either too much whizz or not enough hash, and then between songs he&#8217;d
start really laying into the audience, slagging them off. Then when I&#8217;d
start the song they&#8217;d all be looking at me through red mists, in the end
I took the mike away from him :-)</p>

<p><em>Did you explicitly change your vocal style ?</em></p>

<p>Well it did change, I know &#8216;cause when I listen to the early stuff I
think f**k But I didn&#8217;t do it consciously.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For Sale: 1.8 kg of assorted sweets. The surplus of confectionery is the
result of an unfortunate trick or treat incident a few years ago.</p>

<p>The wife and I had argued for many hours over who was going to escort
our two young children, dressed up in Halloween outfits, carrying
pumpkins to demand money with menaces from neighbours. The alternative
was even worse - to stay at home and answer the door to similar young,
lovable street urchins.</p>

<p>When I realised United were playing in Europe, I quickly opted for the
latter. The doorbell kept ringing and I dutifully kept answering the
door, said &#8216;Ooh what a lovely outfit&#8217; and proffered the tray of treats.</p>

<p>The game started. The doorbell kept ringing incessantly. I answered the
door for the thousandth time. When I returned, United had scored. The
doorbell rang again. I ignored it. The doorbell rang again. I turned the
lights off and went into the back room. The doorbell rang again -
constantly.</p>

<p>I opened the door. &#8216;Happy Halloween ! Trick or treat&#8217;. &#8216;You know what
lads. I think I&#8217;ll take my chances and go for a trick.&#8217; &#8216;Oh come on
mister. Can&#8217;t we just have some of those sweets or a quid ?&#8217;. &#8216;No. I&#8217;m
sorry. Good-bye&#8217;.</p>

<p>Next morning, I was relieved to see no eggs splattered on my windows and
no excrement lying with the morning post.</p>

<p>However, I did notice some minor graffiti chalked on the front wall. I
quickly washed it off. Only it didn&#8217;t come off. It wasn&#8217;t chalk but
looked like wax. I washed it off with hot water and detergent. Only it
didn&#8217;t come off. I tried bicarbonate of soda with neighbours watching
me. Finally I got gloves and a face mask and used hydrochloric acid but
the single word stubbornly remained.</p>

<p>Still, my kids and wife thought this was absolutely hilarious and there
was a silver lining to this cloud. When we gave people directions to our
house, we closed with</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;Turn right. Our house is half way down on the left, after the tree
with <strong>IDIOT</strong> written on the front wall.&#8217;</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Doug <a href="http://oracledoug.com/index.html">Burns</a> posts a typically honest
<a href="http://oracledoug.com/serendipity/index.php?/archives/1116-Blowing-my-own-trumpet.html">article</a>
about the art of self-promotion and the issue of references. Personally,
I think Doug&#8217;s blog is itself an excellent tribute to his technical
competence, his ability to communicate and share information as well as
offering an insight into his personality.</p>

<p>I must confess that my manager&#8217;s Inbox is not overflowing with glowing
testimonials from colleagues and customers, let alone unsolicited ones.
I used to reassure myself that this was because IT managers are
exceptionally busy people with (justifiably) high expectations when
paying for expensive consultants. Nowadays I just put it down to my lack
of technical ability.</p>

<p>However, occasionally a customer will say a heartfelt &#8216;Thank you. That
was really useful&#8217; after a onsite visit which is probably the most
satisfying part of my job.</p>

<p>Recently, a person commented on this blog asking about issues with
Siebel and UTC. I tried to help directly via email and received a reply
thanking me for taking the time to answer his questions. Of course, I
deleted the original comment as I have no desire to turn this site into
&#8216;asknorman.siebel.com&#8217; but his words of thanks were much appreciated.</p>

<p>Many years ago, during an IT slump, I was trying to secure a contract as
a Unix/C programmer. I had an interview at Ingres but was unsuccessful.
A week later, the agent called me. The opportunity was suddenly and
unexpectedly back on and &#8216;could I possibly start on Monday ?&#8217;.</p>

<p>Unusually, the agent insisted on meeting me in person and told me that,
for various reasons, the first choice candidate didn&#8217;t really work out.
Consequently, he was let go after one week and I was to be on probation
for one week with this very demanding client.</p>

<p>The agent proceeded to call me every lunchtime and again at home every
single night to discuss progress, technical issues, clamouring for any
verbal, implied or written feedback from the client about my technical
abilities.</p>

<p>Judgment day duly arrived on Friday. As I nervously approached to get
the verdict, the manager said &#8216;I&#8217;ve got to leave now, Norman but thanks
for all your efforts this week. See you on Monday&#8217;. Probably the best
reference I never had.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/drupal/">Drupal</a> gets an upgrade to 4.7.4
via the Bluehost Fantastico auto-installer.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/wiki/">Wiki</a> gets converted to
<a href="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki">MediaWiki</a> simply because it
is a lot easier on the eye. This software requires PHP5 and I was
originally on a server running PHP4. However I read that Bluehost does
also support PHP5. I just asked politely and got moved to a different
server. No fuss. No questions. Technical support just did it. Quickly
and efficiently.</p>

<p>Of course, neither package is currently used but that&#8217;s beside the
point.</p>

<p>DreamHost
<a href="http://www.dreamhoststatus.com/2006/10/30/wordpress-one-click-install-updated-to-version-205/">upgraded</a>
to the recently released WordPress
<a href="http://wordpress.org/development/2006/10/205-ronan/">2.0.5</a> almost
immediately. I think I prefer Bluehost&#8217;s strategy of waiting a while for
any creases to be ironed out before upgrading.</p>
