<div class="entry-content"><p>Short answer - She was in a meeting. I sent a polite email asking why my
MP Susan Kramer failed to vote last night on the third reading of the
Digital Economy Bill.</p>

<blockquote><p>Dear Mrs Kramer</p>

<p>Many thanks for taking the time to send me a long and detailed
letter is response to my email inquiry about your stance on the
Digital Economy Bill.</p>

<p>You&#8217;re right - it&#8217;s a very complex issue and may yet be subject to
refinements before it finally becomes law.</p>

<p>However, as you seemed to support the bill but oppose certain
clauses, I was curious to find which way you voted last night in
Parliament at the bill&#8217;s third reading.</p>

<p>From reviewing
<a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm/cmtoday/cmdebate/32.htm">Hansard</a>,
it appears you couldn&#8217;t be bothered to vote at all. Which disgusts
me.</p>

<p>You&#8217;ve just lost another vote in the forthcoming general election.</p></blockquote>

<p>I then received this response</p>

<blockquote><p>Thank you for all you emails regarding the Digital Economy Bill. Susan
has asked me to respond on her behalf and I hope you don&#8217;t mind my
doing so. Please accept my apologies for the group email but we have
received so many emails on this issue that it is the only way I will
be able to respond to you all today.</p>

<p>First of all let me assure you that this is a very important issue
to Susan and the rest of the Parliamentary Lib Dem party and she
takes your views very seriously.</p>

<p>The Government has been intent on forcing through the Digital
Economy Bill through the â€˜wash up&#8217; as they believed it would face
less opposition with many MP&#8217;s having already left Parliament for
their constituencies. The Government was so desperate to get this
Bill through in fact that they pulled DCMS Minister Ben Bradshaw off
his slot on News Night.</p>

<p>Bills going through the wash up are usually done in a more secretive
fashion and full parliamentary party attendance is not required or
expected. For this reason there were not many MPs there, but Lib Dem
Shadow Minister Don Foster was debating on behalf of the Lib Dems. I
have been in contact with his office over the course of the past few
days passing on messages of concern from a number of
constituents.</p>

<p>As many of you may be aware the Liberal Democrats were completely
opposed to this Bill going through the wash up and wanted it to come
before Parliament when it resumes after the election so that it may
be subject to full scrutiny and debate. We were originally intending
to table an amendment to clause 43 but decided, in light of fierce
opposition to the clause, to oppose it totally. The Tories were
planning to support the Government but barely any Tory MPs actually
turned up.</p>

<p>We were unaware that there was going to be a vote on the Bill until
only an hour beforehand. Susan was at that time in a very important
meeting in the Constituency and despite trying, could not make it to
Westminster in time. For your assurances, she would have opposed the
Bill totally. Thankfully and with the help of some labour rebels and
individuals, we managed to oppose the Bill.  All Lib Dem MPs in
Westminster at the time voted against the 3rd Reading of the
Bill.</p>

<p>As I am sure you will now be aware Clause 43 has been totally
dropped from the Bill. This is a fantastic result.  Furthermore it
is doubtful the rest of the Bill will make it onto the Statute books
before Dissolution. Hopefully Susan will be re-elected and if so,
she has promised to make the future readings of the DEB a priority
and will be at future votes to represent your views.</p>

<p>I hope this has been of some interest to you, please do let me know
your views when the DEB comes before the next Parliament and do not
hesitate to contact me should you have any further concerns on this
or any other issue.</p></blockquote>

<p>Words fail me. <em>We were unaware that there was going to be a vote on the
Bill until only an hour beforehand.</em></p>

<p>Great. That really reassures me that you are on top of things.</p>

<p><em>Hopefully Susan will be re-elected.</em></p>

<p>There&#8217;s more chance of Manchester United winning the Champions League
that Susan Kramer securing my vote.</p>
