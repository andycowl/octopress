<div class="entry-content"><p>The Brightside family holiday in Spain was a very relaxing affair. For a
period of 10 days, I didn&#8217;t watch a television, read a newspaper, stare
at a computer screen or even turn my mobile phone on.</p>

<p>In fact, I sat by the pool, listened to music, swam, ate fantastic
seafood, thought a lot and ploughed my way through the Millennium
trilogy by Stieg Larsson.</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.co.uk/lh/photo/fYXZfK5ABbL1eHCIngPp2g?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_l2uGy1RGCiE/TIdiF80AvLI/AAAAAAAABn0/b4PtHcYd1Y0/s400/DSC00370.JPG" /></a></p>

<p>One hot, sunny afternoon, my relaxation was disturbed by the most
awful, horrible, blood curdling screams. I consulted my iTouch; &#8216;D-7&#8217;
by that popular 90&#8217;s beat combo - Nirvana. Ah that explains it. I
returned to &#8216;The Girl Who Played With Fire&#8217; and the exciting
adventures of Lisbeth Salander.</p>

<p>Almost immediately, my train of thought was interrupted by yet more
loud, agonising, terrifying animalistic screams. I looked across at
Norma who was embracing the Spanish culture with a short mid-afternoon
siesta so it definitely wasn&#8217;t her.</p>

<p>I consulted the iTouch again as the blood curdling screaming continued
unabated. Ah - &#8216;Welcome to the Atrocity Exhibition&#8217; by the popular
80&#8217;s beat combo - Joy Division from the &#8216;Live at the Paradiso&#8217; bootleg
(available from all good Torrent sites).</p>

<p>I reduced the volume by a notch and was about to summon up the energy to
adjust the parasol to get some shade.</p>

<p>Suddenly, away to my right, I saw a flash of green as my radiant wife,
Norma, suddenly and spontaneously leapt from her sun-lounger. That&#8217;s
strange I thought - Cocktail Happy Hour doesn&#8217;t start for another 40
minutes. I watched Norma as she ran at breakneck speed towards the
swimming pool.</p>

<p>I thought I&#8217;d be sociable so I turned my music off and went to join her
for some watery frolics followed by discussion of the very important
issue of the choice of venue for tonight&#8217;s meal.</p>

<p>I stood next to her at the edge of the swimming pool and suddenly my
brain went into overdrive. My iTouch was off and yet the loud, agonising
screams continued.</p>

<p>Wait - there was a middle aged man splashing about in the water. Wait -
is he in difficulty ? Wait - he can&#8217;t be - this pool is 1.80m at its
deepest. I can stand up in the pool everywhere apart from 2 square
metres where I have to stand on tip-toes. Wait - he&#8217;s shorter than me.
Wait - what the heck is going on here ?</p>

<p>As my brain struggled to parse the situation in front of me, Norma
spontaneously and spectacularly leapt into the swimming pool.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a horrible, hackneyed cliche but it was like watching life in
slow motion. The middle aged man was still thrashing about rather
frantically and he was making the most horrible noises. Loud,
prolonged, deep blood curdling noises. At first, I wondered if he was
a Joy Division or Nirvana fan and just singing &#8216;D-7&#8217; followed by
&#8216;Welcome to the Atrocity Exhibition&#8217; in his very own unique version of
underwater, punk karaoke.</p>

<p>Norma and another gentleman in the pool gradually moved towards drowning
man like two sharks closing in on their prey. But without the triangular
fins.</p>

<p>Finally, my brain woke up. This guy didn&#8217;t appear to be larking about.
There were no children with him. He genuinely looked like he was
flailing his arms around and panicking like, well, a drowning man. His
eyes were open and he was conscious and vertical but I wondered if he
was having a fit or an asthma or panic attack.</p>

<p>As I considered entering the water, Norma got closer to the drowning
man. I heard a voice behind me: &#8216;Can we go and get an ice-cream yet
Dad ? It&#8217;s nearly 4 o&#8217;clock.&#8217;</p>

<p>My daughter Norma Jeane was at my side carefully reviewing progress on
her sun tan and, incredibly was thinking about her stomach rather than
the drama unfolding in front of us. Even more incredibly, Norma Jeane is
a qualified life guard.</p>

<p>&#8216;Hang on Norma Jeane - your Mum&#8217;s a little busy at the moment saving a
drowning man.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh - shall I just get her a Magnum Classic then ? Have you got any
Euros ?&#8217;</p>

<p>Norma reached the flailing man and went to lift him. The man seized
his opportunity and pushed down hard on Norma&#8217;s shoulder to lift
himself out of the water and get some air into his lungs The laws of
physics meant that he immediately pushed Norma fully under the
water. Norman Jeane offered &#8216;Oh yeah - that&#8217;s a classic life saving
mistake. We did it on the course. You should always support the
drowning man low down before he has a chance to grab you and risk
drowning you.&#8217;</p>

<p>Thankfully, the man&#8217;s screams finally subsided and Norma and the other
man lifted the man, rather ungracefully, up onto the poolside - laid
out like a beached seal. The hotel pool man immaculately clad in white
shirt and white long trousers (like an extra from &#8216;An Officer and a
Gentleman&#8217;) ambled over. &#8216;Everything ees OK, si ?&#8217;</p>
