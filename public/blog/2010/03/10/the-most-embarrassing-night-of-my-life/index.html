<div class="entry-content"><p>Working title: the dangers of Facebook, online dating, stranger danger
and gross stupidity.</p>

<p>The (now defunct)
<a href="http://www.thechameleons.com/">Chameleons</a> remain one of my favourite
bands but were responsible for the most embarrassing night of my life.</p>

<p>After the band reformed, I went to their London gigs and occasionally
frequented the (now defunct)
<a href="http://forums.thechameleons.com/">Wishville</a> forums for discussion
about the band, concert reviews, banter about football, discovering new
bands - all the usual stuff we did before Twitter and Last.fm came
along.</p>

<p>In November 2002. The Chameleons played a single date in London
before a German tour. As I had struck up a friendship with a like minded
individual on Wishville (liked footy, liked The Chameleons, liked a
laugh) and exchanged messages with him, we arranged to meet up for a
drink in Camden before going on to the gig.</p>

<p>Mark Burgess is a City fan,
so he&#8217;d arranged the gig deliberately to clash with United playing Bayer
Leverkeusen in the Champions League so I&#8217;d hoped to see most of the game
before going to the venue.</p>

<p>Anyway, we exchanged mobile phone numbers,
exchanged descriptions and arranged to meet in an Irish pub (public bar)
that was showing the football. I didn&#8217;t tell my Mummy in case she was
worried about me meeting a strange man I&#8217;d recently met on the Interweb.</p>

<p>Inevitably, something screwed up on the night mainly because we are
blokes. I can&#8217;t recall precisely what happened but someone had a flat
battery, lost their phone or told their Mummy so I arrived at this
hostelry and furtively tried to identify this gentleman from a (Wedding)
photo he&#8217;d shown me.</p>

<p>To cut a long story short, I couldn&#8217;t find him and he couldn&#8217;t find
me. Worse, the footy wasn&#8217;t been shown in the Irish pub or rather, I
think Arsenal was being shown instead of United, so I went elsewhere
to watch the game.</p>

<p>After a few beers and United taking a 2-0 lead, I made my way to
Dingwalls. Now, there was no way I was going to make contact with my
&#8216;Internet acquaintance&#8217; in a packed venue so I was quite prepared to
enjoy the support (Brian Glancy), soak up the pre-match atmosphere,
drinking overpriced lager while watching the technicians twiddle
buttons on amps, place guitars on stands and say &#8216;One Two - One Two&#8217;
into microphones while waiting for The Chamleons to take the stage.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, as always, alcohol intervened and as I watched Glancy
performing, I happened to see a young lady who was also a regular on
Wishville. This young lady spent every spare minute and every spare
quid on watching bands and had traipsed around Germany and the States
following The Chameleons on tour.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I only knew
&#8216;Cath&#8217; by reputation and only recognised her by virtue of her
distinctive dyed red hair. While I enjoyed her superb gig
<a href="http://blogs.myspace.com/upthedownescalator">reviews</a>, we&#8217;d never
communicated directly so I didn&#8217;t know her and she certainly didn&#8217;t know
me.</p>

<p>I should have just left it well alone but for some reason I didn&#8217;t
and I approached a complete stranger (a female one at that) and
memorably opened with: &#8216;Hi Cath. Do you know where Joe is ?&#8217;</p>

<p>Cath Aubergine (for that was her rather unusual name) broke off her
conversation with her mate, turned to me and replied: &#8216;Sorry - what ?
Joe who ? Who are you ?&#8217;. There may have been the odd expletive thrown
in for good measure.</p>

<p>&#8216;Joe - I arranged to meet him here but&#8230;.&#8217;</p>

<p>Blank stare. Her mate is also now looking at me with a similar blank
stare.  27.4 seconds left before the 6&#8217;2&#8221; boyfriend returns from the
bar with their drinks.</p>

<p>&#8216;Look - you know. Joe - Mr. Moto. Have you seen
him ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh Mister Moto - why didn&#8217;t you say ? But what&#8217;s your name ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Andy.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Sorry - did you say &#8216;Andy&#8217; ?&#8217; Another piercing, blank,
suspicious stare. Times two.</p>

<p>&#8216;Look. I&#8217;m RomanTotaleXVII on the forums but my real name&#8217;s Andy,
alright&#8217;. Christ - the embarrassment levels were now excruciating as
we were having to shout this conversation above the noise of Bryan
Glancy&#8217;s set.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh so you&#8217;re RomanTotaleXVII but hang on - you&#8217;re not RomanTotaleXVII
any more. You are now&#8230;&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yeah, yeah I know.  I&#8217;m now FieryJack.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yeah - you&#8217;re the guy who names himself after The Fall
characters. Well why didn&#8217;t you just say so ?&#8217;</p>

<p>And so it came to pass - Cath Aubergine led me to the bar area and
introduced me to Mr. Moto (aka Joe Donellan).</p>

<p>&#8216;Hey Joe - I&#8217;ve got someone who wants to meet you. Here he is -
RomanTotaleXVII&#8217;.</p>
