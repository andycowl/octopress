<div class="entry-content"><p>Idea for a new TV series - &#8216;When Ethernet cables go bad&#8217; - A
fascinating 60 minute documentary into the wide range of issues people
have with wireless networks. The program would also include some &#8216;C&#8217;
list celebrities and a phone/text in competition to win something.</p>

<p>I have had a wireless network in my house for at least four
years. Perusing the annals of this blog reveals that while I have
experienced
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/04/11/wireless-upgrade/">various</a>,
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/02/24/wireless-wierdness/">sporadic</a>
<a href="http://nbrightside.com/blog/2006/04/17/more-wireless-fun">issues</a>
over this period, by and large, the wireless network has been pretty
reliable with three PC&#8217;s, a laptop and an iTouch device using it
without problems.</p>

<p>Most issues could be resolved simply by rebooting the router and cable
modem or very occasionally traced to a broader problem with network
connectivity from my ISP, Virgin Media.</p>

<p>Recently, my 7x24 Internet monitoring service known as my son came
down into the lounge to watch TV. This normally means one thing - the
Interweb is down and Call of Duty is missing one of their
Lieutenants. And so it proved.</p>

<p>On this occasion, rebooting the router and modem didn&#8217;t resolve the
problem and plugging a laptop into the cable modem proved that the
lack of connectivity wasn&#8217;t due to Virgin Media.</p>

<p>A hard reset to the factory defaults and running an open network
worked. For a while. Then the router dropped again. Installing the
Linksys firmware to replace the open source and freedom loving
<a href="http://www.polarcloud.com/tomato">Tomato</a> software worked. Briefly.
Then it broke again. Stubbornly the router reported &#8216;Could not renew
lease.&#8217;. No matter how many times, or how hard, I hit the &#8216;Renew
Lease&#8217; button.</p>

<p>This state of affairs simply could not continue so after investigating
a little on the Interweb, I reached the reluctant conclusion that my 5
year old Linksys wireless router was, in technical terms, broken.</p>

<p>Curiously, for me, I spontaneously decided to buy another Linksys
router to replace it. A like for like replacement.  Subconsciously,
despite the unit failing, I still viewed Linksys as reliable and found
myself strangely reluctant to try another make and model.</p>

<p>I quickly shopped around and purchased a <a href="http://www.ebuyer.com/product/103185">Linksys
WRT54GL</a> and, to my surprise,
found it slightly cheaper at ebuyer.com than my usual preference for
online purchases - Amazon. The router arrived the next day and I was
able to quickly configure the network again as the family gathered
expectantly inquiring &#8216;Can I play Call of Duty yet ?&#8217;, &#8216;When can I
check my email ?&#8217; and &#8216;Listen - I need to get on Facebook now.&#8217;</p>

<p>Everything ran smoothly and everyone was deliriously happy. For 8 days
until Norman Junior III came down into the lounge to watch TV
again. After a period of 8 full days without watching any TV or
speaking to us.</p>

<p>&#8216;Is it down again ?&#8217; &#8216;Yeah - I rebooted both boxes and
my PC can see the router but the router can&#8217;t access the Internet.&#8217;</p>

<p>Back upstairs to stare at the Administration screens and the
worryingly familiar &#8216;Can not renew IP address&#8217; message. This time, I
installed the Tomato firmware which worked briefly. I then reverted to
the Linksys firmware as I prepared to raise the problem with Linksys
technical support. But I didn&#8217;t need to as, after resetting to the
factory defaults and reconfiguring, it worked. Internet access was
restored. Everyone was happy and didn&#8217;t thank me. For a couple of
days.</p>

<p>This loss of connectivity was now a complete mystery and now
starting to get very irritating. Brand new router. Sporadically
failing. My son and I stared at the blue box with the flashing lights
and the contents of the new router box looking for the sentence on
&#8216;Troubleshooting&#8217;.</p>

<p>Norman Junior broke a rather stony and tense silence: &#8216;What&#8217;s that
blue cable ?&#8217; &#8216;Oh - it&#8217;s just an Ethernet cable that came with the
router.&#8217; &#8216;Maybe that would work better as it&#8217;s brand new.&#8217; &#8216;It won&#8217;t
be that. These problems are not caused by an Ethernet cable. They
either work or they don&#8217;t.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What&#8217;s the harm in trying it though ? We haven&#8217;t got any other ideas,
have we ?&#8217; So I exhaled loudly, sighed, threw in a couple of
expletives and switched the original grey Ethernet cable supplied all
those years ago by Virgin Media with a shiny, new, slightly shorter
blue Ethernet cable.</p>

<p>And lo and behold, the blue Ethernet cable worked. Access to the
wireless was restored. The bloody Internet worked. Perfectly. For 3
weeks, 4 days and 17 hours and counting. Rock solid.</p>

<p>He&#8217;s a bloody genius, my son.</p>

<p>And the elephant in the room - the original &#8216;failed&#8217; Linksys WRT54G
router sitting up on top of the wardrobe, taunting me, calling to me,
nagging away at me like a dripping tap. The temptation to switch back
to the original router and try it with the blue Ethernet cable is one
I have been able to resist. So far.</p>
