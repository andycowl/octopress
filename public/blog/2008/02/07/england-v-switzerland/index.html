<div class="entry-content"><p>Last night, I took Norman Junior III to visit the new, improved Wembley
stadium last night to see England play Switzerland in a friendly.</p>

<p>After paying homage to Sherlock Holmes, we changed at a packed Baker
Street for the fast Metropolitan line to Wembley Park. We stood on the
platform as one train departed and I was just contemplating whether we
should &#8216;go for it&#8217; when the next train arrived or step aside and wait
for the next one.</p>

<p>A well dressed lady was complaining to a London Transport official:
&#8216;Listen - I&#8217;ve been here for 25 minutes and I just can&#8217;t get on any
train.&#8217; &#8216;Well I&#8217;m awfully sorry madam but we currently have 90,000
football fans going to Wembley.&#8217; &#8216;I can see that but I do need to get
home. It&#8217;s an absolute disgrace. What about all the ordinary people ?&#8217;</p>

<p>Thankfully, my dithering indecision was abruptly removed by the late
arrival of some shaven headed Ing-er-land fans who charged up the steps,
ran towards the closing doors and whisked us both up and onto the
underground train into a packed carriage. Well, to be fair it was
positively spacious compared with the Waterloo &amp; City line on a weekday
morning.</p>

<p>Three Swiss lads were then subjected to a deep probing English
inquisition from curious Ing-er-land fans.</p>

<p>&#8216;Hey mate, what language do you speak then ?&#8217; &#8216;In Switzerland, we speak
Swiss-German.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Hey mate, what&#8217;s the capital of Switzerland then ?&#8217; &#8216;Zurich&#8217;</p>

<p>A brief lull and respite for the Swiss visitors before a final burst of
alcohol fuelled inspiration:</p>

<p>&#8216;Hey mate, can you sort a bank account out for me ?&#8217;</p>

<p>Cue uproarious laughter all round - well from those passengers who were
able to move their ribcages.</p>

<p>Walked down Wembley Way watching day trippers taking photos and entered
the stadium. Wondered what qualifications are needed to be an &#8216;Escalator
Steward&#8217; and took our seats high up in the South stand with an excellent
view.</p>

<p>Much to my surprise, the minute&#8217;s silence for Munich was observed by the
vast majority of supporters.</p>

<p>England appeared in yet another away kit (available from all good sports
outfitters in March). The decision to play in the away strip for a home
fixture was puzzling but it transpired that Capello ordered this after
hearing that Ashley Cole &#8216;preferred playing away&#8217;.</p>

<p>At least, we were both cheering a team in Red with Rooney, Ferdinand and
Brown (or rather Wes Orange). The game got underway, Brown endured a
nightmare opening 45 minutes and Matthew Upson is undoubtedly the most
one-footed player ever to don an England shirt.</p>

<p>Switzerland were neat and tidy and comfortable on the ball without
really threatening the goal.</p>

<p>England were playing 4-1-4-1 and looked nervous. For the first 40
minutes I don&#8217;t think I have seen so many sideways and backwards passes
since Ray Wilkins played for United.</p>

<p>While I didn&#8217;t hear any booing, there was the occasional Beckham chant
and increasing unrest in the unpadded seats as half-time approached.</p>

<p>Suddenly, unexpectedly, something happened - Joe Cole remembered he was
an attacker, took a defender on and Jermaine Jenas gratefully scored the
first goal under Fabio Capello&#8217;s regime.</p>

<p>After an overpriced drink, we were staggered to head the announcer
proclaim &#8216;Please welcome the teams back for the second half - Here they
are, protecting their 1-0 lead - England !&#8217; The Italian influence
already seems to be pervasive.</p>

<p>The second half improved markedly until the Swiss had the temerity to
score with a well taken goal. The Swiss contingent rang their cow-bells
and chanted &#8216;La Suisse&#8217;. Ing-er-land fans responded with &#8216;We know you
speak Swiss-German and Zurich is your capital city.&#8217;</p>

<p>The hard working England captain, Stevie Gerrrraaaarrrrd, got to the
dead ball line and crossed for substitute Sean Wright-Phillips for
another tap-in.</p>

<p>Peter Crouch came on, Cashley Cole went off to a solitary shout of
&#8216;Where&#8217;s your Cheryl gone ?&#8217; and Wayne Rooney dropped a little deeper.
In fact, he was so deep he was playing at left back, conceding corners
and passing balls down the line to Wayne Bridge.</p>

<p>England continued to press for another goal and an otherwise impressive
David James made his inevitable token error, flapping at a high cross.</p>

<p>Die hard, loyal fans who apparently are &#8216;Ing-er-land till I die&#8217; decided
to avoid the queues at Wembley Park and streamed out of the stadium.
When the full-time whistle blew, the stadium was half-full. Part time
supporters.</p>

<p>The game ended 2-1 for England. The remaining Ing-er-land fans were
happy and we started the long journey home via Wembley Central herded
together like cattle on the station approach with a &pound;6 program for
company.</p>
