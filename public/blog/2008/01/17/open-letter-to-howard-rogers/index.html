<div class="entry-content"><p>Howard</p>

<p>When Tim Hall
&#8217;<a href="http://www.oracle-base.com/blog/2008/01/09/tag-here-goes-a-chain-letter/">tagged</a>&#8217;
me, my initial, instinctive gut reaction was: God- what an infantile,
puerile idea. There&#8217;s no way I am going to participate in that
&#8217;<a href="http://oracleappslab.com/2008/01/07/orablog-tag/">meme</a>&#8217;. The concept
wasn&#8217;t new to me as I&#8217;d already seen Scoble and those Web 2.0 PR types
participate in similar mindless activities which I just chose to ignore.</p>

<p>However, my reasons for objecting were slightly different from yours.
Normally, I despise being told what to so and what to blog about.
Similarly, whenever my various employers announced a &#8216;Dress down Friday&#8217;
which was gleefully received by my colleagues, I would purposefully don
a suit and tie. After all, a uniform on a Friday is still a uniform.</p>

<p>Secondly, the very thought of having to identify eight further victims
to be tagged also filled me with dread. Not because I worried about
OraNA being swamped with an exponential explosion and prolonged burst of
non-technical content but, because, I feared the unlucky recipients may
possibly share my feelings.</p>

<p>Of course, they could all maintain a dignified silence and simply ignore
my pleas to join the party but what if they also hated this Web 2.0
&#8216;meme&#8217; but were too shy, polite and retiring to tell me what they really
thought. I know a handful of &#8216;bloggers&#8217; but have only met two in the
flesh and (thankfully) slept with neither.</p>

<p>While I did discover some new blogs of interest, not necessarily because
of the &#8216;8 things&#8217;, I must admit that I quickly tired of hearing about
people&#8217;s job history, favourite cars, mental and physical disorders
(mild or otherwise), alternative careers, wild death defying adventures
and the fact they once killed a man with their bare hands in the Burmese
jungle.</p>

<p>So why, I hear you ask, did I capitulate, run towards the cliff and
conjure up a disposable blog entry titled &#8217;<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2008/01/09/8-things/">8
things</a>&#8217; ? Well,
the truth is I thought it was a cheap post, I was short on inspiration
and there was some elements I wanted to write about which don&#8217;t merit a
full blog post but were better suited to a short bullet point.</p>

<p>I followed your analysis, comments and thoughts with interest (for the
first couple of days at least). I continued to read your blog, I tracked
your
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/comp.databases.oracle.server/browse_thread/thread/3c87bec81e750ade/70cb3e2e81499c77?lnk=gst&amp;q=hjr.pythian@gmail.com#70cb3e2e81499c77">posts</a>
on c.d.o.s, I monitored your
<a href="http://oracledoug.com/serendipity/index.php?/archives/1375-I-hate-chain-letters-....html#c5586">comments</a>
on other blogs. When I saw your detailed analysis, use of analogies and
various lengthy responses and compared with it my paltry, throwaway
one-liners, I felt like a troll.</p>

<p>I occasionally <a href="http://blogs.oracle.com/otn/2008/01/11#a1188">commented</a>
myself and you normally responded. Not, I suspect to get the last word
but you genuinely care. A lot. I admired your passion and felt somehow
inadequate that I had spontaneously chosen to respond to what some
Oracle bloggers (unwisely IMHO) had termed a &#8217;<a href="http://oracledoug.com/serendipity/index.php?/archives/1375-I-hate-chain-letters-....html">chain
letter</a>&#8217;,
&#8217;<a href="http://awads.net/wp/2008/01/10/i-am-a-spammer-and-so-are-you-if-you-played-the-tag-game/">spam</a>&#8217;
or a &#8217;<a href="http://oracleappslab.com/2008/01/11/so-very-tired/">game</a>&#8217;.</p>

<p>I am genuinely sorry that you have decided to shut down your site as (as
I have stated before) your blog, forums and articles represent an
invaluable set of technical resources for anyone working with Oracle.</p>

<p>I am sorry if my trite comment on your blog that I &#8216;hadn&#8217;t signed up to
your terms and conditions when I started my blog&#8217; irritated you and may
have, in some small way, contributed towards your decision.</p>

<p>However, just as it is your prerogative to close your site down, I have
the same right to post about my travel nightmares, &#8216;47 things&#8217;, my
thoughts on Newcastle&#8217;s new manager or Scoble&#8217;s laugh.</p>

<p>Particularly, as my blog is not (currently) aggregated by OraNA and
hence will not contaminate or interrupt the stream of consciousness.</p>

<p>Mind you, never say
<a href="http://oraclesponge.wordpress.com/2006/12/27/so-farewell-then-dizwell/">never</a>.</p>
