<div class="entry-content"><p>Last Thursday, 152 people (16 crew and 136 passengers), in addition to a
significant number of people living in Hounslow, narrowly escaped death
when a British Airways flight from Beijing (BA038) was forced into an
emergency
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/7196526.stm">landing</a> at
Heathrow airport.</p>

<p>Several things struck me about this
<a href="http://www.aaib.dft.gov.uk/latest_news/accident__heathrow_17_january_2008___initial_report.cfm">incident</a>
and the aftermath:</p>

<ul>
<li>After a phone call to update me on all the domestic news and gossip,
my wife somehow negated to impart this tidbit of useful and relevant
information. I hung up and turned on the TV news to be staggered by
images of the wrecked fuselage of a British Airways jumbo jet lying
of the fringes of the runway, 15 miles from my house, surrounded by
foam, slides deployed with 18 fire appliances surrounding the scene.</li>
<li>As I was flying from Belfast into Heathrow the following day, I
consulted the BMI website which curiously maintained flights would
be subject to delays and cancellation following, in a slight
understatement, the &#8216;incident at Heathrow&#8217;. Funnily, enough, the
<a href="http://www.aaib.dft.gov.uk/home/index.cfm">AAIB</a> agrees with me and
defines an accident as &#8216;an occurrence during the period of operation
of an aircraft where the aircraft incurs damage&#8217;.</li>
<li>A man from Oxford who walked away with his life would have quite
liked British Airways to provide him with a <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7196128.stm">cup of
tea</a> followed by some
counselling.</li>
<li>Another couple thought they had just had &#8216;a bumpy landing&#8217; and
therefore didn&#8217;t require any tea and biscuits. In fact, these Aussie
backpackers were just delighted to get their baggage back without
queuing at the carousel and to receive a complimentary return ticket
for the Heathrow Express.</li>
<li>A surreal moment boarding the flight at Belfast, picking up a
newspaper with the stricken 777 plastered all over the front page.</li>
<li>British Airways&#8217; decision to
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/7198598.stm">parade</a> the
pilot, co-pilot and Julie, your cabin service director, before the
world&#8217;s press. The BA crew all looked shell-shocked and distinctly
uncomfortable. Mind you, so would I, if I was slowly starting to
assimilate the events and trying to recover from a near death
experience (without a cup of tea). This implied to me that BA were
either very keen to get the media off their backs and leave them
alone and/or BA are already absolutely certain of the circumstances
of the accident and knew for a fact, pilot error was not a possible
contributory factor.</li>
</ul>


<p>Finally, I must confess that I know absolutely nothing about airplanes,
fly by wire or wind shear. I am also totally ignorant of the size of the
pigeon population of South West London and possible deficiencies in the
quality of Chinese aircraft fuel.
However, if the AAIB investigation subsequently discovers, in the coming
months, that the co-pilot had successfully brought a 100 ton aircraft
into a crash landing, having lost power to both engines, and
miraculously managed to clear the perimeter fence by 10 feet, I will be
truly amazed at the skill of the pilots.</p>

<p>If the investigation shows that, following a catastrophic,
non-reproducible computer error, the co-pilot somehow had the foresight
to raise the flaps to somehow bring the aircraft down on the grass to
stop it within 300 feet instead of landing on the concrete runway where
it surely would have exploded with complete loss of life, wouldn&#8217;t that
be the most staggering and heroic feat ever ?</p>
