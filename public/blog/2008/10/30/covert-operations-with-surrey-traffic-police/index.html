<div class="entry-content"><p>Surrey Traffic Police should run a recruitment campaign with the tagline</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;Join Surrey Traffic Police and see the world.&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>This would appeal to young men who fancy the glamour and travel
traditionally associated with the Armed Forces but are slightly wary of
losing their lives in Iraq or Afghanistan.</p>

<p>In August, I hired a car mid-way through my holiday in Venice to drive
to the foot of the Dolomite mountains and also took the opportunity to
visit Lake Garda.</p>

<p>So that explains why, on the hot, sunny, blissfully lazy afternoon of
Sunday 10th August, I was driving slowly through the lovely small
Italian town of Spresiano.</p>

<p>To save money and increase fuel economy, the Brightside family were
crammed in to a rather underpowered Fiat Panda as we explored churches
and Italian villages using the delightfully, quiet country roads.</p>

<p>Imagine my surprise, as I left the sleepy town heading for Treviso, I
was flagged over by two Carabinieri (not Italian police - Carabinieri)
who were obviously not merely equipped with radar guns but real guns.</p>

<p>The official approached my window and made a polite request in
rapid-fire Italian. I looked blank and replied &#8216;Sorry - Inglese - do you
want to see my driving licence and documents ?&#8217;
He looked perplexed and a little disappointed: &#8216;Oh so you are English,
yes ?. What are you doing here ?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;We&#8217;re on holiday and hired a car to come to see your beautiful
mountains and Lake Garda&#8217;. I pointed at my family who were listening to
iPods, reviewing sunburn and consulting the map studiously in an effort
to reinforce my argument.</p>

<p>I got out of the car and opened the boot to locate the hire car
documents and dig out my driving licence. A pile of wet towels, a
rucksack, some beach shells and a large bottle of Fanta Orange fell out.
The military official looked dismissively at me.</p>

<p>&#8216;So - why are you having a pink driving licence ?&#8217;</p>

<p>A multitude of witty answers immediately sprang to mind but I contented
myself with &#8216;Well - that&#8217;s what the English Govermnment gave me.&#8217;</p>

<p>His colleague, irritated and curious about the delay on a routine
traffic stop, wandered over and the mood lightened. &#8216;Oh you are coming
from London. I have been to London in 2005 - do you know Li-ches-ter
Square ?&#8217; followed by &#8216;I have always wanted to visit Ed-een-burro&#8217;.</p>

<p>Finally, their checks complete, I was free to continue my journey. I
summoned up the courage and whispered: &#8216;Excuse me but was I travelling
too fast ?&#8217;.</p>

<p>The two Carabinieri looked at each other and said &#8216;Oh no - no problem -
it is just a routine stop. This is normal in Italia.&#8217;</p>

<p>And then, in a scene reminiscent of the Great Escape where Gordon
Jackson has his papers checked by the Gestapo and the German officer
quietly says &#8216;Good Luck&#8217; as he goes to board the bus to which Jackson
replies &#8216;Thanks&#8217;, the Italian policeman muttered &#8216;See you in London&#8217;.</p>

<p>This closing comment perplexed me and I assumed I had misheard the
Italian accent. That was until today when I received another
<a href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/12/22/seasons-greetings/">letter</a>
from my friends at Surrey Traffic Police. The letter formally notified
me that, on 23 October 2008, 3 further points have now been cleared from
my driving licence (leaving an outstanding total of just 3).</p>

<p>Chillingly, the official letter closed with:</p>

<blockquote><p>PS. Hope you all enjoyed your holiday in Venice</p></blockquote>
