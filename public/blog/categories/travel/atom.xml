    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This morning, a gentleman was reading a copy of The Times on my South
West Trains service bound for London Waterloo. Nothing too surprising
about that.</p>

<p>However, this man continued to intently consume the day's important news
stories as he left the train and made his way down to the Underground
network.</p>

<p>This chap wasn't reading a newspaper though. He was an early adopter so
he was reading the electronic version of The Times on an Apple iPad.
Clearly, the content is so captivating, the display is so sharp and the
font is so crystal clear that he simply has to continue reading the news
as he descends the staircase at platform 4, tightly packed in a mass of
humanity, down to the Waterloo and City line.</p>

<p>I'm not a rabid Apple hater. I think Apple are an innovative design
company who have helped spark some much needed competition; particularly
into the mobile ‘device' market.</p>

<p>What irritates me though is the fact that this chap wasn't using the
iPad like people use a newspaper. People don't generally read a
newspaper as they descend a set of stairs. People generally don't hold
a device costing over &pound;400 (although I suspect this chap
splashed out on the 3G/WiFi/64GB version which costs a staggering
&pound;750) out in front of them and nonchalantly pretend to to
fascinated at the content while navigating a set of steps and
simultaneously being jostled by rushing commuters from all directions.</p>

<p>This gentleman was doing this for one reason and one reason only -
fervently hoping and praying that someone, just anyone, would look at
him and his fancy tablet, maybe even ask him about it, exclaim ‘Wow !
Alan - look, that guy's got an iPad !' or just surreptitiously try to
look over his shoulder to catch a glance of last night's football
results.</p>

<p>Part of me was urging him to lose his footing, tumble forward down six
steps, falling flat on on his face, dropping his fancy, overpriced,
electronic gadget, shattering the screen in three places.</p>

<p>But unfortunately he didn't. Despite me barging into him. Twice.</p>

<p>What a complete iPoser.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Brightside family holiday in Spain was a very relaxing affair. For a
period of 10 days, I didn't watch a television, read a newspaper, stare
at a computer screen or even turn my mobile phone on.</p>

<p>In fact, I sat by the pool, listened to music, swam, ate fantastic
seafood, thought a lot and ploughed my way through the Millennium
trilogy by Stieg Larsson.</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.co.uk/lh/photo/fYXZfK5ABbL1eHCIngPp2g?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_l2uGy1RGCiE/TIdiF80AvLI/AAAAAAAABn0/b4PtHcYd1Y0/s400/DSC00370.JPG" /></a></p>

<p>One hot, sunny afternoon, my relaxation was disturbed by the most
awful, horrible, blood curdling screams. I consulted my iTouch; 'D-7'
by that popular 90's beat combo - Nirvana. Ah that explains it. I
returned to 'The Girl Who Played With Fire' and the exciting
adventures of Lisbeth Salander.</p>

<p>Almost immediately, my train of thought was interrupted by yet more
loud, agonising, terrifying animalistic screams. I looked across at
Norma who was embracing the Spanish culture with a short mid-afternoon
siesta so it definitely wasn't her.</p>

<p>I consulted the iTouch again as the blood curdling screaming continued
unabated. Ah - 'Welcome to the Atrocity Exhibition' by the popular
80's beat combo - Joy Division from the 'Live at the Paradiso' bootleg
(available from all good Torrent sites).</p>

<p>I reduced the volume by a notch and was about to summon up the energy to
adjust the parasol to get some shade.</p>

<p>Suddenly, away to my right, I saw a flash of green as my radiant wife,
Norma, suddenly and spontaneously leapt from her sun-lounger. That's
strange I thought - Cocktail Happy Hour doesn't start for another 40
minutes. I watched Norma as she ran at breakneck speed towards the
swimming pool.</p>

<p>I thought I'd be sociable so I turned my music off and went to join her
for some watery frolics followed by discussion of the very important
issue of the choice of venue for tonight's meal.</p>

<p>I stood next to her at the edge of the swimming pool and suddenly my
brain went into overdrive. My iTouch was off and yet the loud, agonising
screams continued.</p>

<p>Wait - there was a middle aged man splashing about in the water. Wait -
is he in difficulty ? Wait - he can't be - this pool is 1.80m at its
deepest. I can stand up in the pool everywhere apart from 2 square
metres where I have to stand on tip-toes. Wait - he's shorter than me.
Wait - what the heck is going on here ?</p>

<p>As my brain struggled to parse the situation in front of me, Norma
spontaneously and spectacularly leapt into the swimming pool.</p>

<p>It's a horrible, hackneyed cliche but it was like watching life in
slow motion. The middle aged man was still thrashing about rather
frantically and he was making the most horrible noises. Loud,
prolonged, deep blood curdling noises. At first, I wondered if he was
a Joy Division or Nirvana fan and just singing 'D-7' followed by
'Welcome to the Atrocity Exhibition' in his very own unique version of
underwater, punk karaoke.</p>

<p>Norma and another gentleman in the pool gradually moved towards drowning
man like two sharks closing in on their prey. But without the triangular
fins.</p>

<p>Finally, my brain woke up. This guy didn't appear to be larking about.
There were no children with him. He genuinely looked like he was
flailing his arms around and panicking like, well, a drowning man. His
eyes were open and he was conscious and vertical but I wondered if he
was having a fit or an asthma or panic attack.</p>

<p>As I considered entering the water, Norma got closer to the drowning
man. I heard a voice behind me: 'Can we go and get an ice-cream yet
Dad ? It's nearly 4 o'clock.'</p>

<p>My daughter Norma Jeane was at my side carefully reviewing progress on
her sun tan and, incredibly was thinking about her stomach rather than
the drama unfolding in front of us. Even more incredibly, Norma Jeane is
a qualified life guard.</p>

<p>'Hang on Norma Jeane - your Mum's a little busy at the moment saving a
drowning man.'</p>

<p>'Oh - shall I just get her a Magnum Classic then ? Have you got any
Euros ?'</p>

<p>Norma reached the flailing man and went to lift him. The man seized
his opportunity and pushed down hard on Norma's shoulder to lift
himself out of the water and get some air into his lungs The laws of
physics meant that he immediately pushed Norma fully under the
water. Norman Jeane offered 'Oh yeah - that's a classic life saving
mistake. We did it on the course. You should always support the
drowning man low down before he has a chance to grab you and risk
drowning you.'</p>

<p>Thankfully, the man's screams finally subsided and Norma and the other
man lifted the man, rather ungracefully, up onto the poolside - laid
out like a beached seal. The hotel pool man immaculately clad in white
shirt and white long trousers (like an extra from 'An Officer and a
Gentleman') ambled over. 'Everything ees OK, si ?'</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I don't know if al the clever Spanish people who study English leave the
country or whether translators aren't very well paid in Spain but here's
some amusing signs from my recent holiday in Marbella.</p>

<p>
> ‘Deposit all remainders here' - Malaga airport.

<p>
I duly placed ‘2' in the receptacle. This was left over when I was
testing Norman Jeane and asked her to quickly divide 12 by 5.

> ‘Millionaires - Private Gentleman's Club. Members only. Please always
> use rear entrance' - Puerto Banus.

Superb English. Nothing wrong with it at all. I suspect [Finbarr
Saunders][] of Viz was commissioned for this wonderful sign.

> ‘Please wait 3 minutes before pulsating' - water bottle dispenser in
> public car park in Ronda.

I am ashamed to say I could only last 2 minutes and 43 seconds before
spontaneously and rapidly pulsating. The car park attendant looked at me
a little strangely.

<p>‘Where's the crane then ?'</p>

<p>We had just embarked on our summer vacation to sunny Marbella (near
Spain) and were sitting on the shuttle bus taking us and our suitcases
from long stay parking to the North terminal at Gatwick airport.</p>

<p>‘Sorry what did you say ?'</p>

<p>‘The crane that gets the cars - where is it ?'</p>

<p>As I pondered what on earth my intelligent teenage son was on about, I
sensed other passengers on the bus pricking up their ears in interest.
The bus was now deathly quiet, in a very British way, as the small
audience attentively and patiently waited for the next exciting exchange
in this bizarre conversation.</p>

<p>‘Sorry, son but what on earth are you talking about ?'</p>

<p>‘Well - we came to one of these massive car parks at this airport a few
years ago when we went to Florida…'</p>

<p>‘Yes - I remember. It's because it's cheaper than getting a taxi and
more convenient than catching the train.'</p>

<p>‘Yes. Well back then I looked at the massive car park area packed with
loads of parked cars. Row after row of parked cars, all tightly crammed
in, and I asked you 'How do they get the cars out when people return
from their holiday ?'</p>

<p>I listened intently together with the other thirteen people on the
‘Summer Special' shuttle bus and sensed the driver was also now
captivated.</p>

<p>‘And you (nods in my direction) told me that a massive crane swung round
to the correct row, dropped down to the exact postion, lifted up the
car, rotated back round and slowly lowered the car precisely into
position on the exit lane.'</p>

<p>I made a spluttering noise as I tried to stifle my laughter. ‘Sorry. I
said what ? No, no - I never said that.'</p>

<p>Norma Jeane now piped up ‘Oh yeah - I remember now. You did say that.'</p>

<p>People looked away. I could see them thinking ‘Oh - look at that tall,
handsome teenage boy. He looks perfectly normal but he actually attends
Special School and now his selfless parents are taking him away for a
lovely holiday.'</p>

<p>‘So - where's the crane then ?'</p>

<p>‘Norman Junior - listen. I might have said that as a joke when you were
6 years old but the cars are parked in lanes according to the date and
times when people are scheduled to arrive back at the airport. For
example, all the cars for tomorrow will be parked in lane 27 with cars
belonging to people getting back in the early morning parked at the
front. Then the men just drive the cars round ready for people as they
arrive.'</p>

<p>‘Oh - so there's no crane then ?'</p>

<p>‘No - sorry son but there's no crane.' I could no longer contain myself
and burst out laughing.</p>

<p>My son looked disconsolate and fell silent.</p>

<p>‘Son - you haven't told any of your mates at school this little story,
have you ?'</p>

<p>‘Nah. All that worries me now is how many other little stories you've
told me over the years.'</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Accidentally.</p>

<p>For the last two weeks, I have been savouring the joys of commuting
into the City on South West Trains and the London underground network.</p>

<p>Like most large, densely populated cities, <a href="http://www.tfl.gov.uk/">Transport for
London</a> has introduced a Smart Card system,
known as <a href="http://www.tfl.gov.uk/tickets/14836.aspx">Oyster</a>, which
allows ticketless travel on trains, tubes and buses.</p>

<p>Most modern cities in the developed world have similar smart card
technology resulting in a faster, more efficient transport system with
cheaper fares for passengers and reduced staffing costs at railway
stations.</p>

<p>Not London.</p>

<p>Last Tuesday, I disembarked at Bank underground station following a
hot, sweaty, uncomfortable 5 minute journey from Waterloo surrounded
by smart, professional merchant bankers wearing trainers and suits. As
usual, everyone strode out purposefully to get off the train first, to
reach the ticket barrier first, to climb the stairs first, to reach
the blissful cool fresh air first and finally, after a interminable 6
minute loss of communication, get a decent mobile phone signal so they
can immediately call the office to show how incredibly important they
are: 'Will be there in 5. Passenger jumped onto live rail outside
Hinchley Wood'.</p>

<p>I ambled slowly along (marvelling yet again at Bryan Devendorf's
drumming prowess) behind a gentleman who was rapidly approaching
ticket barrier No. 3. I withdrew my Zones 1-5 One Day Travel Card and
politely waited for the chap to 'swipe through' (as we Cockney
trainspotters call it) and proceed towards the escalators.</p>

<p>Only he didn't proceed because the failure rate on the Oyster card
system is high. Astonishingly high. The gentleman in front of me
tried to advance by waving his jacket pocket towards the card reader
but, inevitably, his Oyster card wasn't recognised and nothing
happened.</p>

<p>I was listening to The National and wasn't paying full attention so I
didn't immediately notice his quandary until he gave a little yelp. In
fact, he may have given two yelps. One as he rammed into a very hard
and very stationary, unyielding ticket barrier. And another yelp as I
rammed into him from behind with great force.</p>

<p>Once we'd disentangled ourselves, he started to complain that I'd
physically assaulted him. I told him he shouldn't buy an Oyster card
if he couldn't use the bloody thing. One of the three staff manning
the ticket barriers - most countries eliminated all ticket barrier
staff whereas London had to triple staff manning the station exits -
separated us and a 'revenue protection officer' then rubbed salt in
the wound by charging him full fare plus a &pound;10 penalty. I looked
disdainfully at his suit and then I looked down even more disdainfully
at his trainers.</p>

<p>I duly appeared in court yesterday charged with 'Gross indecency in a
public place' but, inspired by 'Judge Judy', I conducted my own legal
defence, launching a magnificent counter claim of 'Inappropriate use
of trainers coupled with a pinstripe suit'.</p>

<p>Thankfully, the judge saw sense and acquitted me after a forensic
scientist gave expert testimony that the rectal injuries sustained by
the gentleman may have been caused by the insertion of a tightly
rolled up copy of 'The Metro' and not sexual assault.</p>
