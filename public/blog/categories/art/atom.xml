    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On Tuesday morning, as I stood on a hot, sweaty, overcrowded South
West Train destined for London Waterloo, I happened to notice a
pretty, young lady reading a magazine telling her what to wear, how to
style her hair and how to look.</p>

overpaid, drug taking women as some sort of bizarre role model
continued to rattle around my head. Inspired I decided to put my
thoughts down on paper - or rather brickwork.</p>

<p>Exclusive, signed, numbered prints are now available for just
&pound;8,995. If you look very carefully, elements of the tie have
been shaded using some of Peter Doherty's blood.
