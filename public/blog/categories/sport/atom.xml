    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The ticket allocations for the London 2012 Olympics haven't been
announced yet so I don't know whether I'll be watching Tom Daley
competing in the 10m platform diving semi final on 9th August.</p>

<p>If I do, I'll be sparing a thought and probably shedding a quiet tear
for Tom Daley's dad, Rob, who lost his 5 year battle against a brain
tumour yesterday.</p>

<p>Last year, I enjoyed a BBC documentary about Tom Daley where his Dad
interrupted a formal press conference to give his son a big hug,
thoroughly embarassing him in the process. You could just sense the
immense sense of love and pride Rob Daley had in his son.</p>

<p>Sadly, he will never get to see him compete at the London Olympics. 40
years old. Sometimes life just isn't bloody fair.</p>
