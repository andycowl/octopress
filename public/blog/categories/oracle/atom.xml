<p>‘Burns - I guess this means I can book the hotel for four nights and
cancel the flights to OpenWorld then ?'</p>

<p>It was 10:30 am on a dull, grey overcast Monday morning in Manchester.
Sherlock Burns and Doctor Timothy Hall had just emerged from a
fractious, tense kick-off meeting at Tiger Telecom. Sherlock Burns and
Dr. Timothy Hall had been called by the IT director at short notice to
investigate a sudden and marked degradation in the performance of the
production database</p>

<p>‘No. On the contrary, Doctor Hall. Please ensure the Hackney carriage is
booked for 4pm together with two first class tickets for the return
train journey to Euston. I have every confidence this case will be
solved by lunchtime. This time tomorrow we will be on a plane to
California.'</p>

<p>‘But Burns - we just sat through a 90 minute meeting with no obvious
solution. Why, I do declare, the customer can't even articulate the
problem clearly and all the project team are arguing with each other.
How on earth -'</p>

<p>‘Dr. Hall - do you recall the pretty chart showing the 'Key Business
Transaction Response Times' ? What did you observe ?'</p>

<p>‘Err - I believe it was Excel 2007 and used a fancy pivot table…'</p>

<p>‘No, no - not that. Didn't you look closely at the X-axis ? The timeline
of the monitoring process was every 10 minutes. After August 15th, the
granularity of the dots changed to every 10 seconds. This coincided with
the performance problems and undoubtedly means the frequency of the
monitoring probe was modified resulting in the increased load on the
system.'</p>

<p>‘Oh Burns - that truly is absolutely magnificent. How did you spot that
?'</p>

<p>‘Obvious Dr. Hall, blindingly obvious. I suspect you will find someone,
somewhere has got his asterisks mixed up when he editted the crontab. A
common failing when you try to convert Windows support staff to the
superior Unix platform. Now as we were brought through the office by our
host and walked through the call centre area, what did you notice ?'</p>

<p>‘Well Burns - I noticed a lot of pretty girls wearing headsets. That
blonde, in particular, was stunning -'</p>

<p>‘No, no - I'm talking about the plethora of 'New Hire Induction Guide'
on their desks. Tiger Telecom has obviously hired all these people
recently which is also contributing more load to the system.'</p>

<p>‘No - Burns - that can't be right. You specifcally asked them in the
meeting what had changed recently and they all insisted: 'Nothing.
Absolutely nothing.'</p>

<p>‘That's why we are here, Dr Hall. Unless you saw it with your own eyes
it didn't happen. Another factor at play here is the Senior Oracle DBA.
He is incompetent and must be replaced immediately.'</p>

<p>‘Oh Burns - how can you say that ? He seemed like a lovely bloke to me
and don't forget he bought us our Latte's.'</p>

<p>‘Shut up Hall. What did you notice on his desk ?'</p>

<p>‘On his desk ? Well nothing apart from that rather amusing 'You don't
have to be mad to work here but it helps' postcard and a photo of his
wife sunbathing in Crete….'</p>

<p>‘No, no. I'm talking about the technical books on his desk. He had a
pile of Oracle books - all the usual suspects; Kyte, Lewis, Milsap and
Antognini. But on the very top of that pile was a curious tome - 'Oracle
Tuning - The Definitive Reference Second Edition' by Donald Burleson. No
self respecting Oracle DBA would have that combination of books. That
alerted me that something was amiss.'</p>

<p>‘Oh come off it, Burns. I think you're putting 2 and 2 together and
making 5 here. That's very unfair -'</p>

<p>‘Dr. Hall. I opened the Burleson book up and noted the following
inscription on the inside cover: 'Barry - all the best in the future and
may your redo logs always be multiplexed :-)' Therefore I conclude this
gentleman was dismissed from his previous post as a contract DBA
following an unfortunate, and ultimately fruitless, exercise in media
recovery. On a production system for an investment bank.'</p>

<p>‘Ah OK, I see, Burns. While we're discussing the technical staff, I just
wanted to mention that PL/SQL developer. I think he needs to be sacked
too.'</p>

<p>‘Interesting, Dr. Hall. Why do you hold that opinion ?'</p>

<p>‘Well - when you asked him how much source code, how many lines of
PL/SQL, how many packages he'd written, he couldn't produce anything.
Nothing. And to think he calls himself a 'PL/SQL developer. He's
obviously an imposter.'</p>

<p>Burns smiled inwardly.</p>

<p>'Not so fast, young, keen, impetuous Doctor Hall. While what you say is
true, the young man did proffer a explanation for this. He showed me a
source code repository populated with comprehensive, well written and
tuned SQL scripts. Why - I do declare he even used Analytic functions.
Young Mr. Barnstormworth justified his stance thus: “If it can't be done
in a single SQL statement, use PL/SQL. If it can't be done in PL/SQL,
use a Java Stored procedure. Otherwise consider ‘C'.”</p>

<p>Dr. Hall looked amazed as Burns had solved another mystery and he hadn't
even had to chat with the Head of IT Operations.</p>

<p>‘Now my good man. That's more than enough work for one morning. I am
ready to eat now and rather appropriately, I think I spotted a 'Pret A
Manager' adjacent to the offices where we can discuss my forthcoming
‘State of the Nation' keynote presentation at Oracle OpenWorld.</p>

<p>The ‘Council Of War' was duly reassembled at 3pm and Sherlock Burns took
a long drag on his pipe before addressing the group:</p>

<ul>
<li>‘Fix the monitor probe interval.'</li>
<li>‘Sack the Oracle DBA.'</li>
<li>‘Promote Daniel Barnstomworth to 'Senior VP of Database
Engineering'.</li>
<li>‘Deploy another RAC node by the end of the year to cater for the
increased user base.'</li>
<li>‘Here's my invoice. Good Bye'.</li>
</ul>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Jeff Moss'
<a href="http://oramossoracle.blogspot.com/2005/11/free-toad-at-least-until-raptor-comes.html">article</a>
about the commercial and free versions of Toad and the incredibly
tenacious, persistent breed of salesperson bred by Quest Software got
me thinking about the Oracle DBA tools I use.</p>

<ul>
<li>People</li>
<li>SQL*Plus</li>
<li>Statspack</li>
<li>putty</li>
</ul>


<p>People are important because people have developed the application,
people are using the application, people are managing the servers,
people are managing the database and intelligent people have
configured that very expensive storage array.</p>

<p>These people know a lot about the application, the history of the
project, the successes and failures, the lessons learned, the
architecture, the infrastructure whereas I may know, quite literally,
nothing about the same subjects.</p>

<p>I have seen people using Toad (and similar GUI based Oracle
development tools) very effectively, multi-tasking, flipping between
windows at breakneck speed. Sometimes it makes me quite tired just
watching them.</p>

<p>However, I prefer SQL*Plus to do most of the work because :-</p>

<ul>
<li>SQL*Plus provides a complete report of my session, with timings,
query plans, statistics. No need to frantically try to write it all
down.</li>
<li>The SQL script can be incrementally developed and is repeatable. It
is quite easy in Toad to execute an arbitrary set of mouse-clicks so
it is not clear which of the six 'alter session' statements were
actually in effect when you finally got the optimal results.</li>
<li>SQL*Plus is the 'vi' of the Oracle world. It is the one Oracle tool
you are guaranteed to have access to, everywhere. The sys admin may
not allow you to install commerial software without a valid license
or may use another tool you have never seen before.</li>
<li>SQL*Plus can use bind variables, provide the query plan (with or
without retrieving the 6 million records) and provide the vital
statistics (consistent gets) just the same as the GUI tools. Almost
everything you need in fact.</li>
</ul>


<p>Statspack is important because it is an Oracle package. Oracle will
maintain and develop statspack for the latest features available in
10g.  Statspack produces reports in a standard format which can easily
be analysed by others (colleagues, DBA's, even Oracle). Statspack can
also be configured to run automatically at regular intervals. If there
is always a problem with the overnight ETL at 03.30, I would rather
statspack gets the overtime and gathers the performance metrics rather
than me sitting there in the middle of the night.</p>

<p>Statspack tells the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the
truth. It is incredibly tempting to use an Oracle monitoring tool like
OEM or Spotlight, obsessively watching the screen, drilling in on what
appears to be an expensive query and your salvation. The problem is
that you don't know the query in question is only spawned once a
quarter for the accountant's financial report and runs in batch. The
query could take 37 minutes and no-one would care. It is simply not
important. It is not what the users are complaining about.</p>

<p>Worse, because your refresh interval is 5 seconds, you are blissfully
unaware that you have missed the crucial SQL query with literal SQL
that takes 1.7 seconds but is executed hundreds of times per second.
Statspack does.</p>

<p>Setting the default statspack level to level 7 means that statspack
can (retrospectively) produce the query plan for any problematic SQL
statement identified in the summary report. This is handy where you
may have long winded SQL statements where the summary report has
tantalisingly truncated the SQL text just as the WHERE clause starts.</p>

<p>Putty is important so you can run O/S utilities (prstat, glance,
topas, top, iostat, vmstat) to monitor the actual database server
during the investigations. If the server is a development server
hosting multiple Oracle instances with 2 CPU's running at 100% and
saturated disks, then the performance of the application will be
impacted, no matter what wizardry you weave.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>London, near England - Wednesday 2 November 2005</p>

<p>The Oracle community was reeling yesterday from the revelation that
the universally respected, internationally renown technical expert and
long standing Oracle employee,
<a href="http://tkyte.blogspot.com/">Thomas Kyte</a>, had made a mistake.</p>

<p>The error was discovered by a Senior Oracle DBA based in Solihull in
the UK, Mr. N. Brightside who explained:</p>

<blockquote><p>"I was dearly looking forward to attending the UK Oracle User Group
in Birmingham and hoped to get my copy of Tom Kyte's latest book,
(Expert Oracle - Database Architecture) signed by Tom
personally. However, at the last minute, my manager told me that the
end of Q3 was imminent and there was no budget available for the
daily 4.50GBP return rail fare. So, I decided to 'work from home'
and sit down to savour Tom's excellent
<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1590595300/qid=1130415782/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl/202-3162097-9903838">book</a>.
Imagine my surprise when I found what appeared, at first sight, to
be a typographical error on page 38. In a paragraph discussing other
relational database systems, Tom incorrectly refers to 'Ingress'
instead of '<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingres/">Ingres</a>'.  Then
to my horror, a quick search on AskTom revealed that Tom makes this
identical misspelling elsewhere. It was not a typo, it was a genuine
mistake."</p></blockquote>

<p>A spokesperson for Apress (the publisher of Kyte's book) commented:</p>

<blockquote><p>"Thank you for the feedback on Tom Kyte's book. We were unaware of
this problem and will update the Errata section accordingly in due
course. However, we did note Tom had a tendency to use a mixture of
'Apres', 'Apress' and 'Apresss' in communications while writing the
book. We attributed this to the long hours he was working on the
book, the tight deadlines or a faulty auto-repeating 'S' key.  When
we politely brought this to his attention, he was absolutely
mortified and apologised profusely for the inconvenience (additional
hard parses, increased latching and CPU utilisation) caused.
Thereafter, he would only refer to the company as ':B1 Publishing'."</p></blockquote>

<p>Tom Kyte was quick to acknowledge the error and said he was only too
pleased to correct the problem although he thought all the fuss and
extra work involved was rather a 'bind'.</p>

<p>Don Burlesson was unavailable for comment but sources reported he was
'absolutely ecstatic at the news'.</p>

    <link href="http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2005/10/29/oracle-newbies-wizards-and-gurus/"/>
    <updated>2005-10-29T21:57:08+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2005/10/29/oracle-newbies-wizards-and-gurus</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently stumbled upon Lisa Dobson's Oracle Newbies
<a href="http://newbiedba.blogspot.com/">blog</a>. Firstly, although I have never
met Lisa, I admire her for two reasons. Firstly, she is about to give
a presentation at the UK Oracle User Group in Birmingham. I am a good
deal older than Lisa and the prospect of presenting to a large number
of 'grumpy old men' would fill me with absolute dread.</p>

<p>Secondly, I really like Lisa's rather self deprecating, modest
statement on her profile</p>

<p><em>I've been an Oracle DBA for 3 years, so still consider myself
a'Newbie'!</em></p>

<p>In my various jobs, I have met several people working with Oracle with
less than three years experience who are variously described (either
by others or themselves) as gurus and would take serious offence if
anyone ever had the temerity to describe them as a 'newbie'.</p>

<p>Some of these people are indeed experienced, knowledgeable,
approachable, flexible, adaptable and eager to learn and perhaps, just
as importantly, to share their knowledge and teach others.</p>

<p>Others are undoubtedly very clever people but are somewhat narrow
minded in their outlook and suffer from tunnel vision. These types are
normally the self-appointed wizards but viewed as insular and
unapproachable by others. They will improve performance almost
instantly by adding or dropping an index, or gathering statistics but
fail to communicate the fact to anyone but merely bask in the glory
and yet higher, even more elevated status.</p>

<p>One aspect of my job that I enjoy is that I often visit a client for a
short period (2-3 days) so I am blissfully ignorant of the politics,
history and personalities involved. In addition, I simply do not have
the time (or access) to use email to communicate. Instead I find I get
more achieved quicker if I meet people face to face or call them on
the telephone to find out information.</p>

<p>This can lead to some interesting situations. Often, the same
questions couched in a slightly different way from a fresh face can
lead to a different response. For example, a simple request to patch
Oracle to 9.2.0.7 or to simply start the OEM Agent that has been
repeatedly requested but ignored (or denied) for many months can
miraculously become feasible almost immediately.</p>

<p>It is surprising how many so called technical issues actually turn out
to be about communication.<a href="http://www.technorati.com/tags/Oracle">\ </a></p>
