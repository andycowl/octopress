    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Time to upgrade Drupal again. Yesterday version
<a href="http://drupal.org/drupal-7.12">7.12</a> was released and this blog is
currently running a very outdated (and probably insecure)
7.4. Although Drupal 7 included automatic update for modules and
themes, updating the core Drupal software still needs manual
intervention and takes time.</p>

<p>Over the years, the main self-hosted blog platforms I have used are:</p>

<ul>
<li>WordPress - one-click updates. Quick and easy. By far the best and most robust solution. Never let me down.</li>
<li>Habari - Official Habari releases were fairly infrequent so I chose to I track the latest development version so upgrade was manual but as simple as typing '$ svn update'. Rolling back was needed on a couple of occasions but possible simply by reverting to the previous SVN version ($ svn update -r <nnn>).</li>
<li>Drupal - manual <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1285892">update</a>. Involves taking the site offline, copying files, thinking, run 'update.php', copying files back again, bringing the site back online and a little time. Slightly tedious as Drupal tend to to release a new version of the core software every month or so with a nagging email reminder to do the right thing.</li>
</ul>


<p>I have also noticed that my sitemap hasn't been generated in 6 months
and doesn't include the most recent entries. In addition, some (old)
posts have been marked as 'Never Update' but after some housekeeping
to modify some permalinks to fix various '404 - Not found' errors,
these old entries now need to be regenerated.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This blog and the handful of
<a href="http://nbrightside.com/blog/2010/12/22/essential-modules-your-new-drupal-7-site">modules</a>
I use has been upgraded to the final version of Drupal 7.0 which was
<a href="http://drupal.org/drupal-7.0">released</a> today.</p>

<p>I was quite pleased that I used Drupal 7 from the early beta versions
and then tracked the D7 release candidates as this gave me valuable
experience in upgrading Drupal 7 relatively quickly while preserving
my additional modules without losing all my data which always
helps. It's worth noting that although I barely scratch the surface of
Drupal 7's wide range of functionality, the quality, reliability and
performance of Drupal 7 was perfectly fine for this blog.</p>

<p>Personally (and rather selfishly), I hope that the formal release of
Drupal 7.0 will encourage more developers to upgrade which, in turn,
which provide impetus for more Drupal modules (and themes) to be
ported and made available for Drupal 7.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>People never ask me 'Hey Norman - what modules have you installed thus
far on this wonderful Drupal 7 powered blog ?'</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://drupal.org/project/archive">Archive</a> - monthly archives.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://drupal.org/project/disqus">Disqus</a> - although I had some
  problems with this module so I am currently using a simple Disqus
  block.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://drupal.org/project/globalredirect">Global Redirect</a> -
  ensures that 'node/1234' is redirected to '2010/21/22/blog-post'.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://drupal.org/project/google_analytics">Google Analytics</a> -
  mandatory to torment myself over visitors statistics using GA.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://drupal.org/project/markdown">Markdown Filter</a> - although I
  haven't fully embraced this yet. Old (raw HTML) habits die hard.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://drupal.org/project/mollom">Mollom</a> - Disqus provides
  built-in spam protection but I use <a href="http://mollom.com">Mollom</a> to
  guard the user registration and contact forms which is very
  effective.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://drupal.org/project/pathauto">Pathauto</a> - to map Drupal nodes
  to my date based permalink structure.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://drupal.org/project/token">Token</a> - required by Pathauto</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://drupal.org/project/tagadelic">Tagadelic</a> - marvellous,
  configurable, graphic 'Tags' page to aid
  <a href="http://nbrightside.com/blog/2010/12/18/crm-bloggers">Bill</a>'s
  navigation of this site.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://drupal.org/project/wysiwyg">Wysiwyg</a> - evaluating various
  options but not found
  <a href="http://nbrightside.com/blog/2010/12/22/marketing-plan-drupal-7-launch">nirvana</a>
  as yet.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://drupal.org/project/xmlsitemap">XML sitemap</a> - produces
search engine friendly sitemap.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>I also modified the 'page.tpl.php' template to reinstate my wonderful,
award winning
<a href="http://nbrightside.com/blog/2007/01/29/how-to-rotate-taglines-on-your-wordpress-blog">rotating</a>
tagline (or slogan in Drupal terminology).</p>

<p>Curiously, I haven't enabled the D7 core 'blog' module as I don't need
multi-user blogs. Each post is simply an 'Article'.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This blog is now running on Drupal 7 (beta 3).</p>

<p>Currently Disqus comments are absent but I am hoping the Global
Redirect module and the Disqus crawler will remedy this given time.</p>

<p>Most of the modules I require are available for Drupal 7 apart from
FeedBurner so I have just re-pointed the feed for now.</p>

<p>Let's see if this appears on the other side.</p>

<p>I will probably convert to using MarkDown markup in due course too.</p>

<p>Main reason for ditching Habari was the lack of user forums.</p>
