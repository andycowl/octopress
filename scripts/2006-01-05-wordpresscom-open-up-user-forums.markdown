Those busy people at WordPress have opened up a couple of
[forums](http://wordpress.com/blog/2006/01/05/forums/) for support
issues and feedback for users of WordPress.com

This is a brilliant idea as I currently have to use the 'Feedback' form
for all my brilliant suggestions and reporting minor glitches which was
a little lonely and uni-directional.
