I am very lazy. It takes a gargantuan effort for me to maintain
motivation and continue making material up for this blog.

Therefore, actually sitting down, in my own time, to compose a letter
to appeal against a &pound;20 fine imposed by Transport For London on
my 14 year old daughter, Norma Jean, was not a task I undertook
lightly.

I didn't appeal because I can't afford the &pound;20.

I didn't appeal because I think my daughter is above the law.

I didn't appeal because I disputed a similar case five years ago when
I was caught on a train without my monthly travel card and
successfully got the fine waived 'without prejudice'.

I didn't appeal because I think I will be successful.

I didn't appeal because I want my daughter to conduct her own defence in
a court of law.

I didn't appeal because I want to get in the local paper.

I appealed because my daughter is entitled to free bus travel and
applied for an OysterCard to prove it.

I appealed because a &pound;20 penalty fine for the heinous crime of
dodging a bus fare of, err, zero pounds and zero pence is completely
disproportionate and utterly ridiculous.

So, when my daughter hangs herself from a light fitting using a pair of
tights in Feltham Young Offenders Institute, don't blame me, blame the
Nazi Bus Inspector who asked her

> 'Do you have an OysterCard ?'
> 'Yes.'
>
> 'Do you have your OysterCard on you ?'
>
> 'Yea - oh no - err, wait a minute, hang on, no, sorry. I left it at
> home.'

to which he replied

> 'Excellent'.
