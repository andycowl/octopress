Yesterday, my son took part in a junior tennis tournament. As I watched
the competitive matches in progress, there was a lot of fist pumping,
grunts, muttered expletives, muted swearing, loud groans and self
flagellation. And that was just the parents. Most of the kids were just
enjoying the tennis.

I often wonder how many of these parents were living out their dreams
through their offspring. Both of my children have already achieved more
in competitive sport than I ever did so I am immensely proud of them and
just try to support them in everything they do - win, lose or draw.

I adjourned to the clubhouse for a coffee and took a moment to enjoy the
hilarious, self-important, officious proclamations on the noticeboard:
> 'Members are reminded that predominantly white tops or T-shirts must
> be worn at all times.'
> 'All members are reminded that, during the club tournament, sporting
> logos on attire must not exceed 3 inches in size.'
>
> 'Shoe tags must be worn by members.'
>
> 'The Club shall be called the Mincing Old Boys Lawn Tennis Club.'
>
> 'A mandatory ball fee will be levied on all participants on club
> nights and mornings.'

As I emerged again with my coffee, I noticed another parent quietly
watching his son from the sidelines. However, this gentleman probably
wasn't living his dreams through his child. It was [Pat
Cash](http://www.patcash.co.uk/).
