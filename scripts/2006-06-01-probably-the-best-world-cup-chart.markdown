Full fixture list, localised TV Schedules, print out and keep wallchart,
pictures of the stadiums, group tables, X-rays of Wayne Rooneys
metatarsal and all of this in an Excel
[spreadsheet](http://parry.co.nz/downloads.html).

For a man who can't even spell Pivot Table, this is a truly staggering
achievement. Or maybe there isn't much to do of an evening in New
Zealand.
