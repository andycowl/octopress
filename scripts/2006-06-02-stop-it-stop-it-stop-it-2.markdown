Oh no. WordPress are now promising to add import/export
[functionality](http://wordpress.com/blog/2006/06/01/livejournal-import/)
which is the only barrier stopping me from migrating to my own hosted
[WordPress.org](http://wordpress.org/hosting/) blog.

That would open up a whole new world of plug-ins, themes, statistics...
