Today I have accepted a new and challenging position after a series of
gruelling, demanding interviews and in depth technical tests. My new
role is working for Dreamhost as a BMC Patrol Monitor Agent.

My key responsibilities are as follows:

Write a blog article offline using Performancing.
Post draft.
Preview article in WYSIWG format on the blog.
Blog is slow and unresponsive.
ssh to Dreamhost server which is slow and unresponsive.
Run 'w' to determine load average which is slow and unresponsive.
Raise ticket with Dreamhost technical support.
Wait for a period of time.
The performance problem is 'resolved'. Perm any one from:
1.  'Denial of Service attack' - now resolved by firewall configuration
2.  'Users in breach of Terms of Service - accounts now cancelled
3.  'Users producing abnormal heavy load' - now migrated to another
    server
4.  Machine was recently rebooted that should solve problem

Repeat whole pointless exercise the next time. Repeat ad infinitum.

So anyone with any recommendations for a reliable hosting provider
capable of hosting a low bandwidth personal WordPress blog, please make
themselves known.

I'm really starting to regret leaving the warm, cozy, uncomplicated
world of hosted WordPress.com.
