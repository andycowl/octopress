My support for the Disqus commenting system used on this blog is well
[documented](http://nbrightside.com/blog/2008/04/09/25-reasons-you-should-use-disqus).
I have also had great
[support](http://nbrightside.com/blog/2008/08/14/in-praise-of-disqus)
whenever I have had minor issues with a service I paid precisely nothing
for.

Disqus are a small company with less than 10 employees. However, Disqus
are not a cottage industry operating out of Daniel Ha's garage. Disqus
are [funded](http://www.unionsquareventures.com/2008/03/disqus.html) by
venture capital (Union Square and angel investors) and raised $500,000
in the last round of funding (March 2008).

So it's not surprising that Disqus are growing and hiring people.
However, what fascinates me is that in addition to hiring talented
developers to develop, improve, enhance and fix the product, Disqus have
recently appointed Giannii as a '[Community
Manager](http://blog.disqus.net/2008/11/19/what-is-a-communty-manager-who-is-giannii/)'.

Ignoring the lack of a surname and some of the Web 2.0 terms sprinkled
in this introductory post; for example, 'Chief Happiness Engineer' is
frankly cringe worthy, it is worth noting that Disqus have many channels
available for people to contact them:

-   Twitter
-   Disqus forums
-   Email
-   GetSatisfaction

More importantly, Disqus don't just sit by the computer waiting for
people to call in - they proactively monitor all these channels and
participate. Moan about a Disqus problem on Twitter and count the
seconds until you get a response.

What is interesting about Disqus hiring a 'Community Manager' is not
necessarily that a small startup can afford one but Disqus (and
presumably the people controlling the purse strings) actually view this
role as one of the first ten, and most important, positions to be filled
in the company.

So what ? Every company has a 'Community Manager' - they are just called
different things 'Sales', 'Marketing', 'Partners', 'Customer Care',
'Public Relations' - every company does this stuff but they don't a)
shout about it and b) dress it up in Web 2.0 tinsel.

To pick just one example, Apple are a big, successful company who make
clever videos and sell expensive, stylish computers, iPods and iPhones
to this type of demographic so surely they must have a 'Community
Manager' ?

Surprisingly, they don't. In September, Apple released the 2.1 firmware
for the iTouch and this update broke WPA2 wireless connectivity. Having
recently acquired an iTouch and been hugely impressed with the device, I
was surprised Apple could have introduced such a fundamental bug but I
ignored it and waited patiently for a patch.

Unsurprisingly, lots of Apple customers experienced the same issue and
multiple threads arose to discuss the issue on Apple's official support
forums. The most popular
[thread](http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=1703504&tstart=180)
now has 36,208 views and 436 replies.

-   How many of the 436 replies came from Apple ? None.
-   Did Apple respond to any of these threads ? No.
-   Did Apple even acknowledge the problem ? No.
-   Do Apple care about their customers ? Not sure.
-   Am I encouraged to give more money to Apple by spending in the
    iTunes Store ? No.
-   What impression does this give to a recent Apple convert ? Arrogant.
-   When is 2.2 scheduled for release ? Not known.
-   Will 2.2 include a fix for this issue ? Not known.
-   Is a fix even on the horizon ? Originally, I would have bet money on
    it but, given Apple's lack of response to date, I am now starting to
    have doubts.

It's obvious that Apple don't have a 'Community Manager'. Does your
company ?
