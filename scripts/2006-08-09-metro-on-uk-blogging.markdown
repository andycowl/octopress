title: Metro on UK blogging

The '[Metro](http://www.metro.co.uk/)' is a free, lightweight,
disposable newspaper, aimed at commuters, which is solely funded by
advertising revenues. So lightweight, you can finish it by the time you
reach Waterloo but at least it saves you the embarrassment of staring at
your neighbour for 27 minutes.

Last month, The Metro reported the exciting
[news](http://www.metro.co.uk/home/article.html?in_article_id=17723&in_page_id=1)
that a quarter of all UK internet users maintain a blog. Hurrah !

However, the veracity of this claim is immediately subverted by the
statement that '59% of bloggers choose to make it public.' So, this
implies that 41% of UK bloggers are blogging in private, by invitation
only, to friends and family or in complete isolation. I know the British
are reserved but that is simply ridiculous.

The article then goes on to claim 'growing numbers of writers see
[blogs] ... as a way to get their voice heard.' A little difficult to
get your voice heard if your blog is not even published on the internet.

I don't think this superb journalism coupled with the deep, considered
incisive analysis is going to challenge Dave Sifry's '[State of the
Blogosphere](http://www.sifry.com/alerts/archives/2006_08.html)'.

PS. Memo to self: Idea for [Dragon's
Den](http://www.bbc.co.uk/dragonsden/) - a decent portal for UK
bloggers.
