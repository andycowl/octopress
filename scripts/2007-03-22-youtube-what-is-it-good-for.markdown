Generally, the quality of cover versions on YouTube can
[vary](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjyr6P1agWo&mode=related&search=)
to say the [least](http://youtube.com/watch?v=QAMyQdBWhUw).

However, covers that purely mime to the original soundtrack are
excellent as you can simply minimise the video and listen to decent
music, you were forced to remove to make way for another yet another
virtual machine.

This

version of
'[Aneurysm](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Zg1lkfQbpo&mode=related&search=)'
by Nirvana has a certain visual appeal though - the drums and cymbal,
the bendy guitar and the socks.
