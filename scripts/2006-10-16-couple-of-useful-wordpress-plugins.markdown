Feedburner - WordPress.com provides users with
[statistics](http://wordpress.com/blog/2006/04/14/feed-stats/) about
feed subscriptions. At best, these metrics were questionable and I used
to provide two RSS feeds (WordPress and Feedburner) so the metrics
didn't capture all feed activity anyway. As there is no equivalent
functionality in WordPress 2.0.4 out of the box, I resurrected my
Feedburner account and installed this WordPress
[plugin](http://orderedlist.com/wordpress-plugins/feedburner-plugin/)
which automatically routes any subscribers to the WordPress RSS feed
through [Feedburner](http://www.feedburner.com/).

Sitemap - I started from zero when I created this site so I could try my
hand at organic gardening. The only search engine I submitted to was
[Google](http://www.google.com/webmasters/). When I was trying to
encourage Google to index the new site, I discovered that a
[sitemap](http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?answer=40318&query=sitemap&topic=&type=)
could accelerate the process. This WordPress
[plugin](http://www.arnebrachhold.de/2005/06/05/google-sitemaps-generator-v2-final)
generates a sitemap which tells the Google crawler about the site
structure and recently updated pages. The sitemap automatically gets
updated after each post and helps to reduce network traffic.
