The
[gift](http://nbrightside.com/blog/2006/02/22/to-whom-it-may-concern)
that simply keeps on giving.

-   '914 scam' - if you don't know the correct name, you may already be
    doomed to failure.
-   'reasons for isolation' - spending too much time on the Internet
    searching for 'reasons for isolation'.
-   "craig gordon" "ian curtis" - odd combination of a dead pop star and
    a living Sunderland goalkeeper.
-   'my wife's shapely legs' - yeah right. Take those stockings off.
    Now.
-   "("current vacancy" or vacancies or opportunity or careers or
    "working with" or "working for") and ("oracle dba" or oracle dba
    )and london" - with such a superlative grasp of search term syntax
    and semantics, you would simply be wasted as an Oracle DBA.
-   'dead bodies in the floor boards' - stop it. You are worrying me
    with the use of 'in' as opposed to 'under'.
-   'how to become a virgin again' - Please sit down. Have a drink. I
    have some bad news for you.
-   'ian curtis hanged ice block' - Look I've already told you twice
    This is an urban myth.
-   'make friends under 14 to 16' - try Facebook or Beebo. Just don't
    get caught.
-   'oracle killed siebel' - Mr. Ellison with the lead piping in the
    library.
-   'selling strategy of siebel system anatomy' - yet another reason I
    don't work in sales.
-   'the most important decision of my entire life' - undoubtedly left
    disappointed at my lack of insight.
-   'urinal pulled his zipper down' - yet another reason I always favour
    a private cubicle.
-   'why durex gossamer withdrawn' - apparently on the advice of the
    Pope.
