I was investigating the bewildering world of trackbacks, pingbacks and
blog comments and found that my existing provider, blogger.com,
supports backlinks (inbound links to a specific article from a Google
search) but not trackbacks.

Then I discovered [Wordpress.org](http://wordpress.org/) which is a
blogging tool that supports proper trackbacks, pingbacks (and a whole
lot more besides). Although Wordpress is a freely available OpenSource
PHP based application, I would need to upgrade my current web hosting
to include PHP (for the massive sum of an additional 4GBP per month).

Then I discovered the hosted service
[Wordpress.com](http://wordpress.com/) which offers the same
functionality so I registered for an invitation email. A little more
research unearthed the useful fact that the recently released Flock
browser also includes a free Wordpress.com account. I immediately
downloaded Flock and got myself this new, shiny Wordpress blog.

I like the blog editing facilities (you can tag each post in multiple
categories) which may render that tedious task of manually adding
Technorati tags obsolete.

Pros: trackbacks, pingbacks, categories, builtin referrer tracking,
immediate WSIWYG preview, automatic Technorati pings

Cons: no direct access to Web server logs and statistics, need to
manually import existing blog from blogger, centred formatting, need
to burn new feed, lose thousands of readers
