I just changed my
[Thunderbird](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/03/08/thunderbirds-are-go/)
setup to move all messages from the IMAP server to local folders and
then apply the various filters locally as opposed to applying filters on
the server. This means that all messages are visible even when
disconnected so I will be able to do email housekeeping in airport
lounges.

I tested each new message filter in turn and everything worked fine.
Unfortunately I discovered that, contrary to the documentation,
Thunderbird 1.5.0.5 does not appear to automatically apply all filters
to new messages in 'Local Folders-Inbox'. Sigh.

Then I was cheered up to discover this humble blog is the '[Featured
Blog](http://flickr.com/photos/70276096@N00/236866211/)' for
[Siebel](http://wordpress.com/tag/siebel/) on WordPress.com.

Well when I say 'Featured', maybe the only blog mentioning 'Siebel' on
WordPress would be closer to the truth.

My life is complete. Almost.
