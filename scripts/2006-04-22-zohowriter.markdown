Just wrote a quick letter using
[ZohoWriter](http://www.zohowriter.com/). An interesting
product. Think of Microsoft Word on the Web. ZohoWriter supports the
standard WYSIWG editor, document versioning, collaboration, blog
publishing and export to Word/PDF formats. My document is saved safely
on a server in the event of any media based disaster striking my PC.

The only comments I have was that it wasn't obvious how to suppress
the header and footer when printing the final hardcopy, I couldn't see
a speel checker and WordPress.com wasn't listed in the list of
supported blogging platforms. But don't quote me as I never took the
time to RTFM so all of this may be possible.

Otherwise a decent product although I suspect
[Google](http://www.google.com/) will be unleashing a revamped version
of [Writely](http://www2.writely.com/info/WritelyOverflowWelcome.htm)
soon which could be interesting competition (nail in coffin) for
ZohoWriter.
