Amazon (UK) recently
[announced](http://www.amazon.co.uk/MP3-Music-Download/b/ref=amb_link_82789473_4?ie=UTF8&node=77197031&pf_rd_m=A3P5ROKL5A1OLE&pf_rd_s=center-0&pf_rd_r=0QH4MW4VEHZ0GDK985R8&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_p=464904573&pf_rd_i=468294)
an online music store and a &pound;3 discount on all music downloads on
Christmas Day and Boxing Day.

To download an album, you need the Amazon Download utility and the music
is MP3 format encoded at 256kbps. Best of all, the music is DRM free so
you can transfer, copy and play on any device. Normally, I like to buy
an actual CD so I can rip into whatever format I need and also as a
backup so 'The Seldom Seen Kid' by 'Elbow' was my first ever purchase of
online music

Downloaded music is automatically added to iTunes or Media Player and
the only glitch was that the Downloader didn't appear to work under
Google Chrome.

As this album (and quite a few others) only costs &pound;3, this album was
free. As in beer.
