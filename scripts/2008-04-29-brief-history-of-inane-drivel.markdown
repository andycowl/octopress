Mark Krynsky posted a interesting post on Twitter (sorry, I simply can't
bring myself to call them 'Tweets')
[inviting](http://twitter.com/krynsky/statuses/799063372) readers to
share their first ever Twitter post.

Trawling through my own Twitter archives, I noted my first ever post
was: 'just signed up. never thought I would' on 9 November 2007 although
I had eariler aired my
[disdain](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/03/12/resisting-the-lure-of-twitter)
on this blog way back on 12 March 2007.

Perusing the archives of my own continuous stream of inance drivel did
unearth the odd gem - well OK then - the occaisional notable one-liner
in a continuous stream of inance drivel.
