BBC News 24 mistakenly
[interviewed](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4774429.stm)
the wrong man about music downloads. The original news story was funny
enough but the actual
[footage](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0cLprNk438) (his face at the
start of the interview) is absolutely hilarious.

I sincerely hope the BBC reward this gentleman with the job he was
applying for.
