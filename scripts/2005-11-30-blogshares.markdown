I quite enjoy the idea of [BlogShares.com](http://blogshares.com/)
which a fantasy stock market for blogs. BlogShares places a notional
value on your blog based on the number (and value) of inbound and
outbound links.  Shares in blogs can then be traded.

BlogShares is also useful for identifying blogs by people with similar
interests. For example, most Oracle technically minded people usually
link to Tom Kyte's excellent [blog](http://tkyte.blogspot.com/) and
their blogs are also worth reading.

However, I am little perplexed as to why BlogShares thinks I have an
outbound link to a Spanish [blog](http://www.lamateporunyogur.net/) I
have never heard of, let alone referenced.

I also enjoyed this intriguing disclaimer on BlogShares about the
outbound links.

> This is a list of all recognised outgoing links from this blog. It
> may not be accurate or complete.

That's a great basis to make investment decisions albeit fantasy ones.
