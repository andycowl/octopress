With no Premiership or Championship fixtures at the weekend, I went
along to watch my local non league club, Kingstonian FC, play on
Saturday afternoon.

Kingstonian play in the Isthmian League which is a regional league below
the Conference (sponsored by Ryman so also known as the Ryman League)
and were hosting Margate.

It was great to be able to saunter round to the half way line and watch
the match from behind the dugouts. It was great to hear the coaches
urging their players on and engaging in gentle banter with the match
officials - â€˜Here Lino - that [offside] had to be bloody close !' It was
refreshing to be able to walk into the bar and get a drink at half-time.

Unfortunately, the football served up in the first half was rather
nondescript with Margate having the bulk of possession but creating
relatively few chances.

After the break, Kingstonian offered a little more threat, particularly
down the left side through full back Tom Bird and midfielder Dean Lodge
and Margate were thwarted by a couple of great saves from Rob Tolfrey in
the Kingston goal.

Against the run of play but to the delight of the assembled 400 home
spectators, Kingstonian nicked a goal and 3 points with a well taken
goal from Lodge after 84 minutes. Kingstonian are now joint top of the
Ryman League, trailing local rivals Sutton United on goal difference.
