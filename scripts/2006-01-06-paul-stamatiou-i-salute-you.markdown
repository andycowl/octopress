Have a look at this [blog](http://www.paulstamatiou.com/). Lots of
interesting, varied material, frequently updated, nicely presented,
excellent use of images, easy to navigate, searchable, well structured
and very professional looking. All in all, an excellent blog.

This blog is by Paul Stamatiou, a 19 year old student. A few months ago,
I happened across this
[article](http://www.paulstamatiou.com/2005/11/03/how-to-boost-your-blog-traffic/)
on Paul's blog when I first started blogging but stupidly forgot to
bookmark it.

This is undoubtedly one of the best personal blogs I have seen. In fact,
I was so impressed I did as he
[suggested](http://www.paulstamatiou.com/2006/01/04/just-a-favor/) and
nominated Paul's blog for the 'Best Teen Blog' award.

Paul is looking for a job this summer. Somehow, I don't think he will
have any trouble getting fixed up.
