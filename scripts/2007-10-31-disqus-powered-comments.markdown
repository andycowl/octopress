I was rather hoping [Disqus](http://disqus.com) would be a 100% plug-in
replacement for the woefully inadequate
[coComment](http://cocomment.com/) so I could simply track all the
comments I leave on assorted blogs and easily monitor other comment
threads of interest.

An RSS feed of such comment activity would be an ideal element to feed
into the Tumble dryer.

[Disqus](http://www.disqus.com/) launched yesterday and as it was
written in
[Django](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/09/26/last-django-in-london/),
looks OK and isn't too invasive or distracting (c.f
[BlogRush](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/09/17/a-rush-of-blood/)),
I have enabled the WordPress plugin on this blog.

Comments can now be threaded (just like
[serendipity](http://www.s9y.org/)) and (thankfully) you don't need to
register with Disqus to leave a comment.

Comments can be rated and the comments are hosted on Disqus forums.

Paul Stamatiou wrote a excellent
[review](http://paulstamatiou.com/2007/10/30/disqus-officially-launches/)
about the features in Disqus and Techcrunch
also[reviewed](http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/10/30/disqus-joins-the-battle-for-your-blogs-comments/)
the software.

I have some minor concerns:

-   I currently use [Spam
    Karma](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/07/10/out-with-the-old-in-with-the-new/)
    to handle comment spam on this blog. SK2 is unbelievably efficient
    and far superior than Akismet. I can count on the fingers of one
    hand, the number of comments and trackback spam that got past SK2 so
    I have some concerns about reverting to an inferior spam filtering
    solution.
-   Until every blog in the world integrates Disqus, I still won't be
    able to track all of my comments. Still, I am still waiting for the
    world to universally adopt
    [Emacs](http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki) and
    [Supercite](http://barry.warsaw.us/elisp/) so email works properly
    so I guess I can live with that.
-   Although you are supposed to be able to quickly and easily import
    Disqus comments back into WordPress, I need to check how this is
    implemented.
-   It is not clear whether Disqus will currently work on hosted
    WordPress.

Obviously, the 'Recent Comments' widget is now defunct so I replaced
that with a RSS widget for the new Disqus Comments RSS feed.
I'll try Disqus out for a while as an experiment but I guess the most
important and valuable feedback will be from readers of this blog.
Without you, I am nothing, a lone voice in the darkness, a blog in
isolation.

So if you have any thoughts, just leave a comment.
