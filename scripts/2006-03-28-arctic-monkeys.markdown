Student, indie, garage band who obviously love Blur and Half Man, Half
Biscuit (but sadly lacking the humour) and then, one day, after missing
a Physics lecture, the drummer comes in with a Macc Lads tape.

No wonder they gave CD's away free at their early gigs. I should have
known better - always give a wide berth to any band who have ever been
described in glowing terms by NME.

I think the pronounced East Yorkshire accent ('Oop') and Sheffield
references ('Hunters Bar') finally did it for me.

A complete waste of money. Music to fall asleep (or drop out of second
year at Metropolitan University) to. Only slightly better (and less
embarassing) than James Blunt and David Gray.
