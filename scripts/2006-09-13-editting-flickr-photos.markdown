[Preloadr](http://preloadr.com/) is an interesting, free utility that
allows seamless manipulation of [Flickr](http://flickr.com/) photos.

The standard features (crop, resize, flip, rotate, sharpen, brightness)
are there but red eye removal is absent which seems a curious, but
important, omission.
