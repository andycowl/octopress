Last night, I happened to catch my wife composing an email. I noticed
that when she sent a personal email to her friends, she invariably typed
'From Norma' as the subject line. This just seemed really weird to me.

I asked her what she thought of the '[semantic
web](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/6318531.stm)' and whether she
had given any thought to adding
[tags](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/03/02/tags-categories-and-labels/)
to her personal emails such as 'Norma' and 'From' to help build a
valuable [taxonomy](http://drupal.org/handbook/modules/taxonomy) for her
friends.

She looked at me blankly and said 'Just because you work with computers,
you think you're so clever, don't you ?'
