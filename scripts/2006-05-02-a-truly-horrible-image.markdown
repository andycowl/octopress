I dearly wish I had not opened a newspaper this weekend.

The image of John
[Prescott](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4959164.stm) receiving
sexual gratification from his secretary, while simultaneously reviewing
a Whitepaper on the environment, is one I am desperately trying to
expunge from my consciousness.
