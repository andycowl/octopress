Just submitted my tax return online which was pretty painless and
quick.  On the final page, I entered some additional information with
a minor query. When I submitted the form, there was a data validation
error.  When I read the error message more carefully, I realised that
the carriage return character is not allowed in the free form text box
so I removed all of them. However, the form was still rejected until I
realised that the question mark character '?' is also not permitted.

So, rather like Tom Kyte, the Inland Revenue is not currently
accepting questions.
