Lots of memories but not the most obvious (Turin 1999, Viera in the
tunnel, Haaland tackle, Ireland WC 2002 outburst).

Keane's words after the 1999 European Cup Final (despite his absence
through suspension) that, after the initial sense of euphoria, he just
felt an enormous sense of anti-climax.

Alex Ferguson also said something similar. Less than 24 hours after
lifting the European Cup in Barcelona, he was already thinking about
next season and the changes that would be needed.

Contrast that with the unnamed United player who said words to the
effect: 'Whatever we do, whatever we achieve, we will never ever
improve on what happened here tonight'.
