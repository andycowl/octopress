Days Inn Hotel. No restaurant service 'because it is Christmas'. No
cooked breakfast 'because it is Christmas'. No Sky Sports which is
normally available but has been withdrawn 'because it is Christmas'.
Boddingtons is available despite the proximity of 'Christmas' at a very
reasonable 2.95 GBP for a pint.

The Marksman hostelry, a mere half a mile away, but a little more
earthy, has Sky Sports at every booth and on big screens and sells
Stella Artois for 2.20 GBP per pint.
