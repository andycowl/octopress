Watching 'World Cup Goals Galore' on BBC3 which also has a fantastic
music soundtrack. Some great goals and memories.

Although I get thoroughly sick of the media hype and the endless
analysis, you can't help but get excited about the World Cup now.

It looks like Rooney may yet be named in the squad. It doesn't look like
Carrick will play the 'holding role' but Carragher might. Let's just
hope he can produce a forward pass and that he doesn't keel over with
cramp in extra time.
