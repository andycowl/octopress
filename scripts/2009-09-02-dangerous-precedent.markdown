UEFA's decision to ban Arsenal's Eduardo for two matches after diving in
a Champions League qualifier creates a precedent, a very dangerous
precedent. This may well result in revisionism, the rewriting of
football history and airbrushing Ashley Cole out of the 2003 Shoot
Soccer Annual.

I forecast the following events which will have unexpected and dire
repercussions for the game:

-   Mexico 1986. Maradona's infamous 'Hand of God' goal is ruled out and
    England win the World Cup. The finest football anthem ever, Baddiel
    and Skinner's 'Three Lions' never gets written; 'Ten years of hurt'
    just doesn't scan.
-   The award of Wayne Rooney's penalty that halted Arsenal's unbeaten
    run is declared 'unsafe'. Arsenal's 'Invincibles' subsequently
    extend their unbeaten run by a further 20 matches. Fanzine writers
    universally rejoice at 'The Immortal 69'ers'.
-   Chelsea, Arsenal and Liverpool mount a joint appeal against
    Cristiano Ronaldo. UEFA reduce his tally of 84 goals in 196
    Premiership appearances to just 3 goals in 27 starts for
    'simulation, posturing and ball hogging.' UEFA conduct a detailed
    simulation of their own using Championship Manager on networked
    PS3's. United are relegated and jostle for top spot with
    [Leeds](http://nbrightside.com/blog/2007/05/02/in-memoriam) in
    Division One
-   Richard Dunne of Manchester City receives a lifetime ban for
    attempting to 'deceive a referee' by impersonating a Premiership
    footballer. Questions are also raised in betting circles at his
    general ineptitude yet contrasting displays of brilliant, solid
    defending in every single Manchester derby.
-   Gerard Houlier is sectioned under the mental Health Act before he
    utters the immortal words 'Ten games from greatness'. He watches
    'Pink Panther' incessantly and practises violent martial arts with
    William

    every Thursday. Later appears in a cameo in 'Kill Bill Vol. 2'.
    Currently in rehab and guesting on 'Soccer Saturday' alongside Phil
    Thompson.
