I subscribe to an RSS feed from the BBC about Manchester United.

This feed contains match reports, previews and general news about
Manchester United.

However, the BBC has an infuriating habit of throwing in content from
the Message Boards which are a forum for 'fans'. Think 5 Live's 606
radio phone-in but worse.

Worse, this
[article](http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/mb606/F2241569?thread=1725706)
appears in the feed as a new article on 15 December. This is a thread
from the '606 message boards - Liverpool'. Newsgator displays the title
as 'If Liverpool don't give Chelsea a run for their money this season,
then we certainly will soon - DG' and the Web page thread is named 'well
played today' referring to Liverpool versus Chelsea.

Why ? What possible relevance does this content have to MUFC ?
