There are two words that are guaranteed to send Norman Junior and myself
into fits of helpless laughter:

1.  'Giraffe' - [Rick](http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/leadballoon/)'s
    wrong answer on 'Trick or Treat' to the question 'What is the
    world's tallest mammal ?'
2.  'Horace' - My spontaneous answer to my son's question 'What were you
    going to call me if it had not been Norman Junior ?'
