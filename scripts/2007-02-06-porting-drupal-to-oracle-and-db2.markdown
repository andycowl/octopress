A couple of interesting papers discussing the portability issues and
challenges involved when trying to port [Drupal](http://drupal.org/) to
the freely available versions of
[Oracle](http://www.oracle.com/technology/pub/articles/pedros-drupal.html)
and
[DB2](http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/library/i-osource9/#N105BA).
