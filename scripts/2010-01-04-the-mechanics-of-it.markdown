Last year, I visited a customer in Swindon. When I arrived at the
office, I noticed some water dripping from the underside at the front
of my car. I didn't have time to investigate or get my hands dirty so
I subconsciously hoped it was just condensation from the air
conditioning unit and tried to forget all about it.

After work, I managed to navigate Swindon's world famous roundabout of
roundabouts and finally locate my hotel. When I parked, I noticed the
temperature gauge was reading high - very high. Sure enough, I got out
of the car to see steam pouring out of the bonnet and was greeted by
the familiar smell of anti-freeze.

I still didn't want to get my hands dirty so I opened the bonnet and
just stared at the problem, hoping that would miraculously fix
it. Then I checked in to my room and rang the AA. I introduced myself
to the operator as 'Hi - my name is Norman and I'm an alcoholic.'

The AA man duly arrived before 'The One Show' had even finished. We
both stood looking at the engine knowingly before he asked: 'Now, Sir,
what seems to be the problem ?'

'Well, I think it's pretty minor and easy to fix. It's just the top
hose has perished and needs replacing.'

'Oh I see, Sir. Why do you think that ?'

'Well, when the engine was running, steam was pouring out of the top
corner of the radiator - right there where the water hose joins.'

'OK, Sir. Thanks for that. Please could you just turn the engine over
for me so I can take a look myself ?'

Engine on. Water and steam billowing out.  Smell of
anti-freeze. Temperature gauge rising.

'Whoa ! That's fine,
Sir. Engine off now, please. Well it's not your hose, Sir. The problem
is over here. It's your bleed screw, Sir. Look (flips the screw from
the middle of the radiator). This bleed screw has sheared off in
half. Quite a common problem on this model. Seen it a couple of times
now.'

I felt a little sheepish (but very relieved that a solution was
in sight) and the man from the AA, James, filled the radiator with 13
pints of cold water and I followed him to a local garage where we
parked and he kindly drove me back to the hotel so I could wash my
hands.

The next morning, I walked into the customer's offices to be excitedly
greeted with 'Oh good - glad you're here. We have got
problems. Serious problems. Performance problems. On production.'

'Ah OK - what seems to be the problem ?' 'Well it's the database, you
see. It's the hard disk - 99% busy. Partition 27b on logical volume 7
is overheating. Oh and another thing that might be relevant - the hit
ratio is right down at 72.7%'

'OK - thanks for that.  Do you think you could just start the system
up for me and I'll take a look myself ?'
