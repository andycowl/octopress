I passed through many customs, immigration and security checks at
various Australian airports in the last three weeks.

Each airport has its own variant on a dire warning that reads:

> 'Flippant, amusing or sarcastic remarks will not be tolerated.
> Offenders may be subject to a $500,000 fine and/or 10 years in jail'.

Of course, we didn't tell Norman Junior III that. My - how we all
laughed when he followed our advice and proudly (and loudly) announced
to the customs official at Brisbane airport.

> 'I have nothing to declare but my genius.'
