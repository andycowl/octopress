Tuesday - An empty black hold-all crashes to the floor from its
precarious position on top of the wardrobe alongside miscellaneous
Christmas packages.

Wednesday - A full length mirror falls and rotates through 180' from
being propped up against the fireplace and sandwiched against a box of
files. I tried to reproduce the path the mirror must have taken but
there simply isn't enough room for the mirror to have fallen the way it
did.

Thursday - A digital cordless phone in the kitchen spontaneously
develops a faulty connection on the rocker switch and beeps incessantly.
Yet another interrupted night's sleep.

Even more spooky, each occurrence happened at 03:58 precisely.

Time to call Yvette Fielding and get the [Most
Haunted](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/01/27/most-haunted-2/)
crew around.
