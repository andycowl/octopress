I heard an interesting interview on Radio 5 yesterday with UK blogger,
[Tom Reynolds](http://www.randomreality.org/aboutreynolds.htm). Tom
works for the London Ambulance Service and his
[blog](http://randomreality.blogware.com/blog) is a mixture of amusing
anecdotes and real-life experiences.

I really like Tom's blog title ('Random Acts of Reality'), his tagline
('Trying to kill as few people as possible'), the dry sense of
[humour](http://randomreality.blogware.com/blog/_archives/2006/8/22/2253063.html)
(summary of his recent
[holiday](http://randomreality.blogware.com/blog/_archives/2006/8/17/2238180.html))
and his general writing style.

Tom started his blog in 2003 which has just been made into a
[book](http://randomreality.blogware.com/blog/DaBook) ('Blood Sweat and
Tea') which is pretty remarkable.

Most definitely, one for the
[blogroll](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/08/09/wheres-your-blogroll/).
