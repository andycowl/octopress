I go away to spend a few days sitting on the UK's gridlocked motorway
network and I discover those chaps at WordPress have been making yet
more changes.

The Regulus theme has been
[upgraded](http://www.binarymoon.co.uk/2006/04/regulus-wordpress-theme-version-21/)
to 2.1.1 and now includes bug fixes, support for sidebar widgets,
personalised header graphic and lots more besides.

In addition, every single post is now prefixed by 'Posted by Andy C'.
This is completely superfluous in my case and I would dearly like to
turn it off. This is my personal blog. Who else is going to be posting
to it ?

Also, the categories and 'Add comment' now appear at the top of the
article rather than the bottom which I also dislike intensely as it adds
distracting clutter.

WordPress have also added feed
[statistics](http://lorelle.wordpress.com/2006/04/15/wordpresscom-new-feature-feed-stats/)
which is a welcome addition although the statistics are not as
comprehensive as those provided by
[FeedBurner](http://www.feedburner.com/) so I'll continue to keep the
Feedburner feed alive for now.

Oh - and before you all jump to signup at once - WordPress had an outage
over the Easter weekend.
