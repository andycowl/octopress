title: PC backups with SyncBack

Two years ago, my hard disk failed. Completely. This was excellent news
as my computer ran a lot faster after a clean installation of Windows XP
but bad news because I lost email, names and addresses, documents etc.

One thing on my to-do list was to investigate offline storage to backup
key data files to avoid a repetition. And, yes, this 'Next Action' had
been on the to-do list for two years.

So now I am using the freeware edition of
[SyncBack](http://www.2brightsparks.com/syncback/sbse-features.html) to
synchronise folders between my two PC's at home and backup key files to
my FTP site. The FTP site is constrained to 30 MB but should be adequate
for now. Large files (photos) are burned to CD.

As I now use Thunderbird (not Outlook Express), my email folders are
simple, plain old fashioned text files that can be imported into any
(normal) email client anywhere.

SyncBack is really intuitive software, fast, well documented and highly
recommended.
