Bob Geldof wanted The Killers to appear at Live 8 at Hyde Park in
London.

The Killers themselves desperately wanted to take part.

Harvey Goldsmith couldn't find room to accommodate The Killers in the
running order because of problems about the closing time and the
provision of police/ambulance/London transport cover for a late ending
at Hyde Park.

Eventually, The Killers played one song on another band's kit at Live 8
in sharp suits to save time on the changeover.
