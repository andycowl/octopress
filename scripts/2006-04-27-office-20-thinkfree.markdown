I was [worried](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/04/22/zohowriter/)
that Google's integrated suite of Web 2.0 office applications would pose
a threat to [Zoho](http://zoho.com/) but another, more immediate
competitor has just
[launched](http://www.thinkfree.com/common/notice.tfo?method=viewNotice)
this week.

[ThinkFree](http://www.thinkfree.com/) provides a similar service to
Zoho offering free, Web-based Word, Excel and PowerPoint software. I
found ThinkFree's charts matches the features in Excel (and is better
than [ZohoSheet](http://www.zohosheet.com/home.do) and
[NumSum](http://numsum.com/)).

In fact, ThinkFree's compatibility with Microsoft Office is so awesome,
at times, it is easy to forget you are not actually using
Word/Excel/Powerpoint. I am surprised the use of the small toolbar icons
does not constitute not a breach of copyright.

ExtremeTech produced an excellent, comprehensive
[review](http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,1697,1952434,00.asp) of
ThinkFree which describes the features in more depth.
