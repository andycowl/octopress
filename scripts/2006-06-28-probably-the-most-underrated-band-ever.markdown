On Monday, I received two DVD's
('[Ascension](http://www.thescourge.com/chameleons_trailer)') containing
225 minutes from some of the last shows by [The
Chameleons](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/01/10/in-praise-of-mark-burgess/)
in San Francisco from October 2002.

Great songs, great lyrics, great artwork. Fantastic. Absolutely
fantastic.

PS. Don't bother commenting that this

rule 3. I know.
