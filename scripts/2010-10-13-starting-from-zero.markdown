One of my favourite and regular UK bloggers, Jonathan Beckett had gone
rather quiet recently so I assumed he must have moved blogging platform
the the Nth time, gone on holiday or possibly his feed was screwed
without his knowledge so I sent him a polite email asking ‘Dead or just
resting ?' and he [informed][] me he'd intentionally changed blog
address without telling anyone.

I think this sudden, unannounced, abrupt loss of service is an excellent
idea for all bloggers - it's a bit like writing ‘I love small, fresh,
juicy satsumas' buried deep in the middle of a technical report to be
delivered to a client or pausing for 5 minutes, with your face in your
hands, during a presentation at Oracle Open World. It helps to focus the
mind and check whether anyone is actually reading or listening.

In fact, this method of social network suicide followed by starting
again from zero and organic gardening is a strategy I have used more
than once during my blogging lifetime. The only difference is my stats
genuinely reverted to zero but I wasn't innundated with curious Tweets,
scribblings on my Facebook walll, IM's and concerned email messages
enquiring about my state of mind and asking for details of the new blog
feed.

I was greeted a wall of silence, pierced only by a solitary email: ‘I
simply adore Clementines'.
