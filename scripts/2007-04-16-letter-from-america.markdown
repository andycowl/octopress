I have been a little quiet recently because I have spent the last two
weeks in Florida during which time I didn't see a computer, pick up a
newspaper and thankfully, didn't speak on a phone.

-   Fly to Orlando
-   Stubbornly refuse the persistent [Alamo](http://www.alamo.com/)
    sales pitch offering an upgrade to a oversized vehicle, pre-paid
    petrol and a host of other unwanted 'options'.
-   Visit [Magic
    Kingdom](http://disneyworld.disney.go.com/wdw/parks/parkLanding?id=MKLandingPage&bhcp=1)
    on the busiest day of the year. Queue to board a ferry boat. Queue
    to buy tickets. Queue to get bag checked. Queue to enter park. Queue
    for restrooms. Queue for food. Board every ride almost immediately.
-   Tie a Vielda cloth to car aerial to keep 3 car convoy together. Tell
    the parking valet, this ripped blue and white rag is the flag of the
    European Union.
-   Trip to [Discovery Cove](http://www.discoverycove.com). Much more
    civilised (free pints of Pepsi). Experience queue withdrawal
    syndrome.
-   Return to Magic Kingdom for nighttime parade and fireworks. Thirst
    for queuing quenched.
-   Stagger and amaze multiple Disney staff by correctly guessing their
    town and state of origin purely from their accents.
-   Meet an American gentleman who accuses me of 'being Dutch', 'not
    speaking proper English' and proudly announces that his
    brother-in-law is 'mayor of Packney'. All in a 28 second ride in a
    lift.
-   Car park attendant at [Sea World](http://www.seaworld.com) finally
    rumbles the state of origin trick - 'hey - did you just read my name
    badge ?'
-   [Kennedy Space
    Center](http://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/home/index.html) -
    'Awesome' is a much overused word in America but on this occasion,
    completely justified.
-   Early start for Universal [Islands of
    Adventure](http://www.universalorlando.com/ioa_index.html). Splash
    out on Fast Pass tickets and gloat as we march to the front of the
    lines.
-   Forcibly ejected from [Dixie
    Stampede](http://www.dixiestampede.com/orlando.php) after answering
    'Stand up if you are proud to be in America' by placing hand on
    heart, waving a star spangled banner and bellowing 'We applaud your
    war of terror'.
-   Don ski-suit, hats and gloves for [Blizzard
    Beach](http://disneyworld.disney.go.com/wdw/parks/parkLanding?id=BBLandingPage).
    Shocked to discover it is a Water Park with massive queues and no
    space to sit down.
-   Drive to Miami Beach. Beautiful people driving flash cars past
    beggars lying on the sidewalk. Can't determine whether people here
    are unhelpful or merely of limited intelligence. Massively
    overrated.
-   Attempt to bludgeon way into adjoining hotel room at 03:47 to kill
    noisy neighbours. Hammer on connecting door, screaming 'TURN IT
    DOWN' which, surprisingly, has desired effect. Wife still unable to
    sleep as she fears drug mafia will enter room to exact dreadful
    revenge.
-   Airboat ride at Everglades [Alligator
    Farm](http://www.everglades.com/). Too scared to hold a cuddly
    alligator or a large yellow snake.
-   Meet a lady who 'loves my accent'. She spent time in England last
    summer. In the famous English town of Newport (near Wales).
-   Hotel safe jams containing passports and valuables (United scarf).
    Duty Manager helpfully asks 'You using the right code ?'.
    Maintenance department fail to open safe. Divine intervention (Clear
    - 9-2-1-1) miraculously unlocks safe as I am about to buy high
    explosives.
-   Welcome drink at [Sloppy Joes](http://www.sloppyjoes.com/) in Key
    West. Heard some decent music (Killers) and nearly died of shock.
-   Call home for United score in European Cup Quarter Final. Father
    claims score is MUFC 5 Roma 0. Hang up as time is short and I am
    convinced he is joking.
-   Gain 3 stone as result of outsize American portions. Started to
    share meals, only eat starters, request childrens menu and finally
    skip meals completely. Weight gain limited to 5 stone as a result.
-   Key Largo. Superb snorkelling on Banana Reef in [John
    Pennekamp](http://www.pennekamppark.com/) Park.
-   Put petrol in car. Advanced computer system for automated
    self-service payment means I only have to enter garage three times
    to complete transaction.
-   Listen to John Mellencamp, Belinda Carlisle and Foreigner and an
    interminable stream of inexorable dross on an array of dreary
    ('Light Rock') radio stations. No wonder the US doesn't produce any
    decent bands.
-   Return hire car. Failed to tip shuttle driver who gave me a stream
    of abuse.
-   Fly back from Miami airport. Sophisticated on-demand video and
    entertainment system functional after a 'master-master reset'. Play
    Tetris continuously for 6 hours with attractive girl seated in 32B.
