I am
[lazy](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/01/27/unix-for-lazy-people/).
I buy my gas from British Gas and my electricity from Seeboard. It takes
a lot for me to overcome my inertia and change provider to save money.

However, I am interested in Carphone Warehouse's
[offer](http://www.talktalk.co.uk/talktalk/servlet/gben-home-Home) of 8
M/bit broadband, unlimited UK landline and international (28 countries
including Australia) calls, all for 21 GBP per month.

This is much less than I am currently paying Telewest for an inferior
package of telephone and broadband services.

The only downside I can see is that the contract is for 18 months.
Obviously a lot depends on the quality of service Carphone Warehouse can
provide to this influx of new subscribers but worth keeping an eye on.

PS. Well I was interested but I just entered my phone number and
postcode to be told 'Your telephone number is not on a BT exchange so we
can't offer you TalkTalk'.

So that is why Carphone Warehouse can only offer coverage to 70% of the
UK.
