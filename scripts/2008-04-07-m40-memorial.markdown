There is a memorial plaque on the northbound M40 motorway in
Oxfordshire.

Out of morbid curiousity, I pulled over this morning to pay my respects
and read the inscription:
> 'Do not stand at my grave and weep Bring a picnic here instead Just be
> careful opening the driver's door Because that's what I did and now
> I'm dead'
