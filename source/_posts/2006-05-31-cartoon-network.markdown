Maybe Doug's right. Perhaps WordPress isn't a suitable blogging platform
for serious technical Web journals (with 473 lines of 10046 trace) after
all.

The latest [theme](http://wordpress.com/blog/2006/05/25/theme-thursday/)
(Solipsus 1.5) announced for WordPress is described thus:
> Black & Brown design, inspired by Adult Swim of Cartoon Network.

That's all folks !
