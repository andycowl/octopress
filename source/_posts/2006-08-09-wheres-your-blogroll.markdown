No-one ever asks me: 'Hey Norman, why don't you have a blogroll with 457
interesting, thought provoking sites for me to look at ?'.

Firstly, while I find the reading lists of others interesting and a
useful means of discovering new sources, I don't particularly want an
lengthy blogroll adding yet more clutter to my (sort of) minimalist
blog.

Secondly, my RSS reading lists are stored on a
[Netvibes](http://www.netvibes.com/) server. I have separate tabs for
'Oracle', 'WordPress', 'Sport', 'News', 'Blogs', 'Tech', 'Software' and
a small one called
'[UK](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/08/08/the-state-of-the-uk-blogosphere/)'.
I would love to be able to publish these tabs and share the contents
with everyone.

Ideally, I would like to publish all my Netvibes tabs somewhere which
would always reflect my subscriptions. This would ensure that the lists
are always up to date and reflect my **current** reading list so
transient blogs (like World Cup 2006) and dead blogs would be removed.

Netvibes has a [ecosystem](http://eco.netvibes.com/) for sharing
resources but I am not quite sure whether this does precisely what I
want. If I wasn't so lazy, I might investigate further.

One thing I like about [Bloglines](http://www.bloglines.com/) is the
tight and seamless integration of the 'My Feeds' reading list with the
Bloglines blog. The blogroll on the Bloglines blog is always
synchronised with the Bloglines reading list. Automatically. No need to
think about it. No need to export your OPML and upload it (again).
Bloglines manages this for you. OK - it was the only thing I liked about
my Bloglines [blog](http://www.bloglines.com/blog/andycowl) but still.

This is exactly how it should be and what
[Share Your OPML](http://share.opml.org/)
is sadly lacking. Share Your OPML has some
promising features for popular and common feeds, feed discovery,
recommendations and match
[making](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/06/02/blind-date/).
However, while I can
[share](http://share.opml.org/viewsharedfeeds/?user_id=3948) my feeds on
Share Your OPML, this is merely a static, outdated list.

The onus is on me to remember to do something i.e. export my reading
list from my current RSS reader and upload a modified OPML file at
recurring, regular intervals.

This is a lot of tedious work for me to do. Computers are much better at
this sort of stuff than humans. We are in 2006 and using Web 2.0 after
all. Finally, please remember that I am very, very
[lazy](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/01/27/unix-for-lazy-people/).

So, that's why I don't have a blogroll.
