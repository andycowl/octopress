Things I like about Wordpress after a couple of days...

-   The dashboard summary which includes 'Incoming Links', recent posts
    and comments at a glance. Wordpress also provides? basic statistics
    (hits, entry page, referrer). It looks like the data? is
    automatically cleaned of spiders and bots so the figures you get are
    more likely to relate to actual human beings. You can also remove
    hits incurred as part of administration.
-   Being able to easily and quickly define a hierarchy of categories
    and tag your posts. I thought that the RSS feed for an individual
    category is really good as it means that Oracle types can choose to
    only subscribe to that element of the blog (and ignore football,
    music and gadgets).
-   Categories also helps navigation. If someone wrote a gem of an
    article two years ago about Linux, you are more likely to be able to
    find it using categories rather than trawling through the complete
    blog.
-   RSS feed for comments.
-   Clean, quick, intuitive, well designed interface.
-   The post editor which includes a WYSIWYG preview. I used to dislike
    the? fact that the Blogger Preview used a larger font so?
    sub-consciously I didn't view it? as the finished article. The
    Blogger Preview, Close, Edit, Preview? cycle required a lot of key
    clicks and wasted time. The Wordpress preview is precisely that.
-   Automatic pings to ping-o-matic (and on to 15 services including
    Technorati).
-   The fact that pasting in text from Blogger preserved the hyperlinks.
    I am still perplexed as to how that worked.
-   Posting seems much quicker compared to Blogger. No more waiting and
    nervously watching 'This may take a while if you have a large blog'.
-   Indenting quoted text correctly uses the 'blockquote' tag.
-   Support for trackbacks and pingbacks as opposed to Blogger's
    backlinks.
-   Support for breaking long posts using 'More'.
-   The price.

Minor things I don't like so much

-   The lack of template editing isn't a big issue for me. If I was that
    fussed, I would use wordpress.org and host it myself. Manually
    tweaking HTML templates isn't exactly my idea of fun. What I would
    really like though is a Template Editor so you can select which
    elements (RSS feed, Comments feed, individual Category feeds) appear
    on the main page. My Yahoo! provide something similar to select and
    arrange content on the home page.
-   The fact the tagline 'Blog in Isolation' does not appear in the Pool
    theme.
-   No automated tool to import from Blogger. I think one exists but is
    currently in for repair. My blog was only 30 articles so I
    laboriously cut and pasted all my blogger articles (and lost the two
    comments).
-   No support for Technorati tags in the post editor but I think I
    prefer using Wordpress categories anyway.
