Finally. All that painstaking effort creating multiple splogs,
scribbling my blog URL on whiteboards at every
[client](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/07/06/just-do-what-you-are-told-2/)
I visit, commenting twice daily on the 'A' listers, spamming the
newsgroups and bribing people for inbound links has paid off.

This humble blog has finally broken through the 100,000

> Day 324. Technorati Rank: 96,498 (56 links from 32 sites)

[Doug](http://www.technorati.com/blogs/oracledoug.com/serendipity/) (a
lowly 1,389,569) needs to pull his finger out.
My life is complete. Almost.
