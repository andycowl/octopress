Like most people, I store information in many different places. Lots of
data is stored directly on my work laptop while yet more data is stored
on my computer at home.

-   Mail folders
-   Address book
-   Text files
-   Corporate blogs
-   Presentations
-   Word documents
-   Intranet resources
-   Whitepapers
-   Web history
-   RSS feeds
-   Photos
-   Music

Even more data is stored on external servers
-   Gmail
-   Blinklist
-   Web site, blogs and mySQL databases at Bluehost
-   Post-it on fridge
-   Mobile phone
-   Palm PDA
-   My head (last resort)

I first used [Google Desktop](http://desktop.google.com/) a couple of
years ago when it was first launched. Back then, the ongoing indexing
process seemed to add a unreasonable load on my laptop, so I decided to
uninstall the program and revert to old-fashioned searching in Windows
Explorer and Outlook (and now Thunderbird).
However, recently I decided to give Google Desktop another go because I
am a Google
[whore](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/02/19/am-i-a-google-whore-yet/).
The initial index of the entire computer took a few hours to index a
grand total of 131,854 items (44,118 emails, 5,059 Web history and
82,677 files).

After the initial index was complete, the overhead of the ongoing index
process barely seemed noticeable (although my laptop has also been
upgraded to a higher specification in the interim).

Google Desktop scans email folders, text files, PDF, Powerpoint, Word
documents, Gmail and Web history. As you might expect, the search is
lightning fast, much faster than searching within Thunderbird although
the range of options isn't as comprehensive.

I find myself using Google Desktop a lot. Often I am not looking for a
specific email, article or document but researching a topic, trying to
locate all possible relevant information from the different sources
available. Google Desktop makes this type of searching across multiple,
disparate data sources very easy and quick.

Google Desktop caches data locally so you can search Gmail folders and
even Web pages while offline. There is also a Preview option available.

I can also increase the accuracy and quality of my search results and
save some disk space by deleting dated, obsolete or irrelevant
information as I find it.

Another neat feature which worries the men in white (or black) hats is a
positive bonus to me. Google Desktop can be configured to search
documents and Web history from my home PC. This feature would be even
better if my domestic email folders could be included as this would
potentially enable me to reply to Dave's email message about drinks next
Thursday or Friday from a hotel room in Prague.

Currently, I would have to call the wife, ask her to log on to the
computer, educate her how to search in Thunderbird, locate the correct
information and mail me the results. All of this is too much trouble
given she moans at being asked to perform the simple task of setting the
video to record
'[Lost](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/03/02/lost-without-lost/)'.

The only minor issue I have encountered thus far is that Google Desktop
does not search within WinZip archives despite claiming to 'search the
full text of Zip files'. This is less than ideal as most of my formal
reports are Word documents zipped up to save space. Just as well then,
that there is precious little of technical value buried deep within
those archives.

Coincidentally, Google Desktop has just been
[updated](http://googledesktop.blogspot.com/2007/03/new-sidebar-and-gadgets.html)
to 5.1 (beta) with a dark, transparent sidebar, improved gadget support
and enhanced security. Although I have experimented with the sidebar, I
don't actually use this feature as I find it too invasive (i.e addictive
and time wasting).
