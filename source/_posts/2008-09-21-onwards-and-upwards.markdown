After over five varied and enjoyable years working for Siebel (and then
Oracle) in Expert Services, I am changing jobs. However, I will continue
to work for Oracle as part of the group responsible for
'[Social CRM](http://www.oracle.com/applications/socialcrm/index.html)'.

Although this was a internal transfer, my interview process was quite
unusual. Instead of being forced to massage my CV into Microsoft Word
format and send an email attachment to a faceless recruitment agency, I
was able to publish my CV using Google Docs and the whole interview
process was conducted by telephone.

A colleague had already thoughtfully pointed my prospective manager to a
blog
[entry](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2008/07/16/how-to-make-100-friends-on-identi-ca-in-14-days/)
that was loosely relevant and he also was keen to review more technical
oriented [content](http://www.nbrightside.com/drupal/node/27) on my Siebel
related blog.

As an aside, you can only imagine the feelings and thoughts that flooded
into my brain when my colleague uttered the immortal words: 'Hey Andy,
I've given your <prospective new manager\> a pointer to a couple of
articles on your blog.'

The role will mean a few changes for me:

- I will now revert to having difficulty explaining to friends and
  relatives what I actually do.
- I will probably spend less time in airport lounges and more time
  with my family. Norma has already expressed grave reservations about
  this element of my career change.
- My manager will be in a different continent and timezone.
- I will be contributing to a corporate
  [blog](http://blogs.oracle.com/socialcrm/) for the first time which
  will necessitate a slight shift in subject matter, terminology and
  slightly less of my dry, cynical, off the wall, British sense of
  humour although I do intend to maintain this personal blog.

I am currently tidying up a few loose ends in Expert Services and
embarking on a emotional, sell-out, European farewell tour to all my
favourite Siebel customers so I won't actually be starting my new role
until mid-October but it will be an exciting change for me and I'm
really looking forward to it.
