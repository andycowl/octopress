I am still in shock at not being shortlisted for the '[Best UK
Blog](http://2007.weblogawards.org/polls/best-uk-blog-1.php)' but I
decided to swallow my pride and enjoy a few hours enjoying the high
quality content of the 10 finalists:

-   [Ian Dale's Diary](http://iaindale.blogspot.com/) - A tagline of
    'Commentary, analysis and gossip from the heart of Westminster'
    completely turned me off and I closed the Firefox tab before I was
    subjected to any more torture.
-   [Guy Fawkes](http://www.order-order.com/) - Hoping for top tips to
    blow up the Houses of Parliament but just got more politics. Yawn.
-   [Neil Clark](http://neilclark66.blogspot.com/) - The winner
    apparently. Anti-war hack with a lot of posts urging readers to vote
    for him.
-   [EU Referendum](http://eureferendum.blogspot.com/) - Simply couldn't
    summon up the enthusiasm to click through.
-   [Pub Philosopher](http://pubphilosopher.blogs.com/) - Promising
    title but yet more (right wing) politics. May as well buy the Daily
    Mail.
-   [The Devil's Kitchen](http://devilskitchen.me.uk/) - Considered
    outpourings on the wit and wisdom of David Cameron. No thanks.
-   [Baggage Reclaim](http://www.baggagereclaim.co.uk/) - Much better. A
    blog recording amusing anecdotes from an anonymous baggage handler
    at LHR. Oh no - wait a minute - it's just a blog about dating and
    'relationships'.
-   [Nourishing Obscurity](http://nourishingobscurity.blogspot.com/) -
    Promising title but this excerpt completely lost me: 'I see that the
    current crop of parents lost their moral compass long ago and this
    is the first generation to grow up "moral-code-lite".
-   [Bright Meadow](http://brightmeadow.co.uk/) - Soft porn alert 'She
    loved how the amber glinted off his bones'. I daren't read any more.
    Particularly as I am on a formal warning from my employer.
-   [Kickette](http://www.kickette.com/) - At last. A discerning blog
    all about football. Only this one is about celebrity footballers
    (Fat Frank), their tiresome girlfriends and pictures of Ronaldo with
    his shirt off.

I was so depressed that I decided to ~~kill myself~~ compile my own
list of the definitive, real, undisputed 'Top 10 UK (and Irish) blogs'
in strict alphabetic order:

-   [](http://oracledoug.com/serendipity/)[BlogStorm](http://www.blogstorm.co.uk/)
    - Internet Marketing/SEO but, refreshingly, from a UK blogger.
-   [Caroline Middlebrook](http://www.caroline-middlebrook.com/blog/) -
    a lady who took the brave step of quitting her IT job in favour of
    blogging.
-   [Donncha](http://ocaoimh.ie/) - WordPress employee \#2 and aspiring
    photographer.
-   [Doug Burns](http://oracledoug.com/serendipity/) - Scottish DBA with
    wicked sense of humour.
-   [Modern Life is Rubbish](http://www.modernlifeisrubbish.co.uk) -
    Quality not quantity.
-   [Pete Ashton](http://peteashton.com/) - Brummie blogger with varied
    mixture of music, photos and tech with no signposts or
    self-importance. Pure blogging.
-   [Random Acts of Reality](http://randomreality.blogware.com/) - I
    help people read books. This guy saves people's lives for &pound;10 an
    hour. Deserves first prize for the blog name alone.
-   [Tim Hall](http://www.oracle-base.com) - Oracle DBA, film critic and
    Karate Kid. Another Brummie.
-   [Tom Raftery](http://www.tomrafteryit.net/) - Irish slant on IT,
    tech and all that Web 2.0 stuff.
-   [Who Ate All The Pies](http://www.whoateallthepies.tv/) - Genuinely
    funny football blog.
