I just booked a flight to Oslo and noticed that under 'Meal Options'
alongside 'Vegetarian', 'Non-dairy' and various religious preferences
was the intriguing option of 'Bland' so of course I immediately selected
it.

I simply can not imagine how plastic airline fare could be made any more
bland.

Will a cabin stewardess really waltz down the aisles demanding 'Did
anyone ask for a bland meal ?'

Stay tuned.
