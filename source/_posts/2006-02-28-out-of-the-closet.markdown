My name is Norman Brightside. I work for 
[Siebel Systems](http://www.siebel.com/) based in Egham in the UK. 
I am a Senior Architecture Specialist in Expert Services. Expert 
Services provide a range of consulting services from architecture 
workshops to performance troubleshooting.

My work is technical (usually includes
[Oracle](http://www.oracle.com/)), varied, includes travel to Siebel
customers located within the UK and Europe and perhaps, most
importantly, involves meeting interesting people and learning.
