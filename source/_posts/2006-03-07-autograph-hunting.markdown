The following celebrities have graced my blog with the odd (in some
cases, very odd) comment:

-   [Matt Mullenweg](http://photomatt.net/) (WordPress)
-   [Dave Sifry](http://www.sifry.com/alerts/) (Technorati). Original
    post deleted as it was an unfounded criticism of Technorati (filed
    in the Bugs database under 'idiotic user')
-   [Stowe Boyd](http://stoweboyd.typepad.com/message/) (Web 2.0 'A'
    lister)
-   [Thomas Kyte](http://tkyte.blogspot.com/) (Oracle)
-   [Paul Stamatiou](http://www.paulstamatiou.com/) (student
    extraordinaire)
-   [Doug Burns](http://oracledoug.com/serendipity/) (roaming, humorous,
    loyal, Scottish Oracle DBA type)
-   [Norman Whiteside](http://www.manutdzone.com/legends/NormanWhiteside.htm)
    (MUFC)

One of these is a joke.
