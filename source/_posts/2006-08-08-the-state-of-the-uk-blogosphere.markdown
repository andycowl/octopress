It really is in a right old state. I have a
[Netvibes](http://www.netvibes.com/) tab called 'UK'. It has a solitary,
uninspiring, dry news feed from the
[BBC](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/default.stm).

Don't get me wrong. I enjoy a lot of blogs from UK authors. Some are
([Scottish](http://oracledoug.com/serendipity/)) technical types in the
[Oracle](http://rittman.net/)
[blogging](http://pjsrandom.wordpress.com/) community with a sense of
[humour](http://oraclesponge.wordpress.com/) while others are Brits who
have [moved](http://andrewsherman.blogspot.com/) to foreign shores or
very talented and dedicated [WordPress](http://www.tamba2.org.uk/T2/)
[techies](http://ocaoimh.ie/).

Clearly, this is highly unsatisfactory and slightly underwhelming. I am
certain there must be a wealth of witty, interesting, fascinating blogs
out there written by [British](http://www.britblog.com/) people but I
just can't find them.

So - come on - where are you all hiding ?
