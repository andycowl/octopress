Google have [announced](http://www.google.com/google-d-s/whatsnew.html)
'[Docs & Spreadsheets](http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/10/10/google-docs-spreadsheets-launches)'
which is an overhaul of the original Writely interface and integration
with Google Spreadsheets. I must admit I prefer the Google Docs
interface and was interested to see that Docs can still publish to a
blog (just like Writely).

The documentation suggests that tagging the article with keywords will
be mapped to matching blog categories and that the document title will
indeed be preserved in the blog entry. However, a simple test confirms
that neither of these two features work as advertised (on WordPress at
least). Sigh.
