John [Chow](http://www.johnchow.com/) notes the vast
[majority](http://www.johnchow.com/yahoo-msn-who-the-hell-are-they/) of
traffic to his blog from search engines comes from Google. I see a
similar [pattern](http://flickr.com/photos/70276096@N00/283530463/) for
this humble blog with over 95% of search engine traffic arriving from
[Google](http://www.google.com/) despite the fact that the blog has been
indexed by the major players.

Although I use Firefox (where the default search engine is Google) and I
hardly ever use any other search engine, I was surprised that the number
of visitors from [Yahoo](http://www.yahoo.com/) was a paltry 2%. I also
thought more people using Internet Explorer would get directed from
MSN/Live as the breakdown of browsers visiting this blog is split evenly
between Firefox and Internet Explorer.

As for [ask.com](http://uk.ask.com/?o=312), I mistakenly thought this
search engine ceased to exist when they recently killed off the English
butler Jeeves. I actually had to go and check the logs to see whether
the Ask crawler had even indexed the pages.
