Another in this occasional but very popular
[series](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/04/03/blankety-blank-competition/):

> 'I am doing this in the best interests of Rooney, the England team and
> 40 million England fans' - Sven Goran Eriksson

...and Alex Ferguson and Manchester United
[fans](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/05/30/mufc-england-2/) can
just cross their fingers and hope.

Still, I am looking forward to this TV
[program](http://www.channel4.com/more4/microsites/S/sven/) tonight.
