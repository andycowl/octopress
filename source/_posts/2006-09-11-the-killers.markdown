The Killers are in the UK to promote 'Sam's Town' and their new facial
hair. The band made an
[appearance](http://youtube.com/watch?v=P4knkxYGz5I) on Jonathan Ross'
show playing the
[single](http://www.islandrecords.com/thekillers/site.html) 'When You
Were Young' and 'All These Things I've Done'. Radio 1 also had a 2 hour
[feature](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/presents/thekillers/) including
interviews and a concert from Blackpool Empress Ballroom recorded on
Friday 8 September. Irritatingly, the BBC haven't grasped podcasts yet
and the concert includes some of the following songs but not necessarily
in this order. The concert starts at 1 hr 20 min.

-   Sam's Town
-   Enterlude
-   When You Were Young
-   Somebody Told Me
-   Smile Like You Mean It
-   Bones
-   Bling
-   Read My Mind
-   Jenny Was A Friend Of Mine
-   Midnight Show
-   All These Things
-   Uncle Johnny
-   My List
-   Mr. Brightside
