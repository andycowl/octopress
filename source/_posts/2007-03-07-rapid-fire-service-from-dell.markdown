I celebrated my recent promotion (to
[BMI Silver](http://www.flybmi.com/bmi/en-gb/frequentflyers/membershipbenefits/silvermembership.aspx))
by ordering a brand new Dell
[computer](http://www1.euro.dell.com/content/products/features.aspx/desktops_better?c=uk&cs=ukdhs1&l=en&s=dhs)
running Windows Vista (Premium) and proudly attaching the tag to my
suitcase.

I then spent hours ensuring I had secured the
[cheapest](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2005/10/29/beware-of-shopping-at-dell-computers/)
price possible and placed the order at 23:12 on Sunday night. Yesterday
afternoon, I received a call from Dell confirming delivery for Thursday
(at an unspecified time somewhere in a 10 hour window between 08:00 and
18:00).

So it appears that the assembly line at Dell is either very efficient or
currently has spare capacity. If you hold stock in Dell and are hoping
for better
[results](http://today.reuters.co.uk/news/articlenews.aspx?type=tnBusinessNews&storyID=2007-03-01T221303Z_01_WEN5003_RTRIDST_0_BUSINESS-DELL-RESULTS-DC.XML)
this quarter, don't hold your breath.

Reminds me of the old joke about the Manchester City fan who calls Maine
Road

'Eh mate. What time's kick-off tonight ?'

'Dunno - what time do you think you can get down here ?'.
