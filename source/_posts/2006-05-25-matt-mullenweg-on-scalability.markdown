WordPress recently bought a ton of resilient hardware and have
undoubtedly improved the quality of service for the 200,000 WordPress
users.

[Matt Mullenweg](http://photomatt.net/) gave an interesting
[interview](http://gigaom.com/2006/05/24/photo-matt-shares-his-wisdom/)
to Om Malik and Niall Kennedy about how startups can plan for future
capacity, provide resilience and maintain performance & scalability.

The IT architects at the UK ISP, Blueyonder, should really listen to
this podcast.
