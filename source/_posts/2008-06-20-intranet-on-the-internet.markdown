Oracle [AppsLab](http://oracleappslab.com/) is one of my longest
standing and favourite blogs.

Jake Kuramoto (and the AppsLab team) always post interesting and thought
provoking articles and I also share a few areas of common interest
(Twitter, Disqus, FriendFeed et al).

Although I happen to work for the same company as Jake Kuramoto, I have
never actually met Jake in person. Curiously, I have had more
interactions with Jake by commenting on the blog as opposed to
communications via Oracle email.

When I read this recent
[post](http://oracleappslab.com/2008/06/20/connect-v2-is-live/)
announcing a new version of Oracle Connect (an internal networking
initiative within Oracle behind the corporate firewall), my immediate
reaction was: 'Why did he post this to the AppsLab blog ? Why on earth
would this possibly be relevant, or of interest, to non Oracle employees
?'

Then I realised such internal developments are of interest to a wider
audience as it demonstrates Oracle's committment to 'Web 2.0'
technologies.

I also pondered how long it would have taken me to find out about this
upgrade if I wasn't subscribed to the AppsLab blog.

There is a certain irony in finding out about internal developments
within Oracle on a public blog.
