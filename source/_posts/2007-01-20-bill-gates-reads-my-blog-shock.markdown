Great news. Bill Gates has heeded my
[advice](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2005/11/09/e-commerce-at-microsoft-uk/)
and I will be able to purchase Vista online and
[download](http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070118/ap_on_hi_te/microsoft_vista)
the media. This means that I no longer have to buy an expensive box full
of fresh air from Microsoft.

Burning a DVD is probably still recommended just in case the seamless
Windows upgrade fails and I discover, to my horror, that none of my
drivers work any more and I have to format the hard disk in order to
boot the computer.

However, I take a similar attitude to risk averse Siebel customers
contemplating the recently released 8.0. I have a large and demanding
customer base (son and daughter) and an integrator who wastes all my
hard-earned money (wife) with a perceived requirement for 7x24 operation
and high availability.

On reflection, it's probably better to let other ~~idiots~~ people
suffer the pain and iron all the glitches out before I take the plunge
when SP1 is released.

That reminds me; I really must ring my Dad tonight and warn him not to
do anything stupid.
