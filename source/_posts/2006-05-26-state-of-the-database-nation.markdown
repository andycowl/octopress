A Gartner/IDC [report](http://news.zdnet.com/2100-3513_22-6077017.html)
summarising the state of the database market in 2005 contains some
interesting nuggets of information.

The database market is still growing at 9.4% (which surprised me a
little).

OpenSource databases account for less than 1% of the market but are
growing fast (47%).

The Linux platform (thanks mainly to Oracle) is showing the strongest
growth (84%).

Despite these two statements of fact, Oracle are not perturbed by the
threat of OpenSource (pass the salt cellar).

Market share:

1.  Oracle - 44.6%
2.  IBM - 21.4%
3.  Microsoft - 16.8%
4.  OpenSource (MySQL, Ingres) - 1%
