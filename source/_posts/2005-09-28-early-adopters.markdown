Recently, I was watching my daughter doing some homework on the PC and
noticed that she was listening to music from a radio stream over the
Internet, talking to her friends in real-time using Instant Messenger,
uploading photos of her holiday to her Web page, ripping music from a CD
ready to copy on to an MP3 player and integrating an chart from Excel
spreadsheet into a Word document.

A couple of things struck me:-

-   Females are indeed better at multi-tasking than men.
-   Where was the homework ?
