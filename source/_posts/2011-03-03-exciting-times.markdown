These are indeed exciting times in the Brightside household:

* Norma Jeane will be taking part in the 125th Lawn Tennis
  Championships to be held at
  [Wimbledon](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2008/07/06/wimbledon-match-report/)
  between 20 June and 3 July. Her precise role isn't known yet but may
  include 'Waiting On (Silver Service)' - fawning over loud,
  overbearing sales people out on a corporate jolly, 'Bar staff'
  (serving jugs of Pimms to middle aged Daily Mail readers) or
  tantalisingly, 'Courtesy car driver' (ferrying a morose
  [Andy Murray](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2009/09/09/inside-the-mind-of-andy-murray/)
  around). This represents a rapid promotion from her initial
  placement two years ago, where she started out on 'Litter collection
  surrounding courts 10 and 11' before being promoted to 'Housekeeping
  duties' or, as she so eloquently put it - 'Cleaning the bogs'.
* Norma will be visiting Holloway prison in April. She claims this is
  part of her District Nursing course but I have my doubts. She seems
  to be watching a lot of those legal dramas recently and taking
  copious notes.
* Norman Junior III is recuperating from fracturing his right arm for
  the second time. Note to self - any activity containing the word
  'roller' that takes place on a concrete road is potentially
  hazardous. He is soldiering on quite well and only needs assistance
  with his socks. He has subsequently changed his XBox nickname to
  'OneArmedBandit' and is experimenting using his toes to manipulate
  the controller.
* I had a brush with West Midlands traffic police last week in
  Solihull after daring to consult a old fashioned map while
  driving. After 15 minutes of being patronised by a fascist pig and
  being forced to beg and scrape on bended knee, I managed to escape
  with a verbal warning instead of the threatened '6 point penalty for
  careless driving'. However, I am still puzzling over the 'correct'
  answer to the copper's deep, probing question: 'Sir, please could
  you tell me why were you travelling at 25 miles per hour in a 30
  zone ?'
