Oracle 'A' lister and Scottish football fan, Doug Burns, was celebrating
last night as he hoisted the inaugural 'Champions League
[Bingo](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/05/17/champions-league-bingo/)'
trophy aloft in an Edinburgh pub.

Burns commented: 'Obviously I am surprised and delighted to win this
cup. I had never played before but the cliches just kept on coming. It
was unbelievable. I was in a noisy pub and I had to ask the barstaff to
pump up the volume and my friends to stop talking but it was worth it'.

Burns secured victory with a superb spot to a reference to Nigel Spinks
and Aston Villa's triumph in 1982 (2 points) and a late rally with a
flurry of references to 'Should he stay or should he go' (16 points).
Doug immediately vacated the scene of his famous victory to continue his
celebrations with his

neighbours.

The special 'OOONNN-RRR-EEE' category was judged by celebrity, Tracey
Temple, former Diary Secretary to John Prescott.

> anti-climax. Just like a night of passion with the DPM, in fact.'
