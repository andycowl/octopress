Google have
[increased](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2007/03/store-and-find-even-more-photos-on.html)
the amount of free storage to 1GB (previously 250MB) available at
[Picasa Web Albums](http://picasaweb.google.com).

This means I can now backup all of my photos comfortably (854MB) in one
place.

If you have lots of photos of your cat, $500 
[upgrades](http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/upgradeStorage) the capacity to
250GB.
