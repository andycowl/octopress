Patrick [Stuebing](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6424937.stm)
from Leipzig (near Germany) has a few issues

-   A curious red object growing out of his head
-   A penchant for redheads
-   Unhealthy obsession with Catherine Tate
-   Unemployed ~~burglar~~ locksmith
-   Father of four young children
-   The mother of these children is his, err, sister.

And I thought I had problems.
