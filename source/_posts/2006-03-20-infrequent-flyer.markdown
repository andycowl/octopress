Well it's been a while but tomorrow I will be resuming my battle with
BAA security
[staff](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/01/16/revenge-of-the-baa-queue-monitor/)
as I pack my thermal underwear for a chilly Stockholm (near Sweden)
where I am hoping the Queen's
[husband](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/03/19/by-royal-appointment/)
will greet me at the hotel reception.

I am giving a presentation (sorry, facilitating a workshop)
imaginatively titled 'Managing Siebel on Oracle'. This should be fun as
this is completely new material and should include a lots of hands on
practical work which inevitably will provoke a lot of questions and
discussion.

Only one major decision is outstanding. Should I use the white
(understated, lighter, easy on the eye) template or the (dark, moody,
almost Gothic) black corporate template ?

Anyone who has seen Oracle presentations should know what I
mean. [Tom Kyte](http://tkyte.blogspot.com/) tends to use White. Most
glossy S&M/keynotes use Black. Guess what - I think I have just solved
my dilemma.
