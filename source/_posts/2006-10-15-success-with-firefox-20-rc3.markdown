Just downloaded Firefox 2.0
[RC3](http://tech.cybernetnews.com/2006/10/12/download-the-release-candidate-of-firefox-2-rc3/)
and it worked a lot better then my previous
[experience](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/10/11/browser-upgrades/).

My lengthy list of extensions (or add-ons as they are now called) also
worked fine.

-   Google Browser
    [Sync](http://www.google.com/tools/firefox/browsersync/)
-   [CoComment](http://www.cocomment.com/)
-   [Performancing](http://performancing.com/firefox)

My thoughts now turn to the day when Microsoft unleash IE7 on the world
through automatic updates to universal acclaim apart from my wife who
will comment 'Why did they have to go and change everything ?'
