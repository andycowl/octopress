On Friday, I saw the massive Rooney crucifixion
[poster](http://www.footy-boots.com/rooney-nike-poster/Rooney%20Nike%20Large.jpg)
on the westbound M4 in Brentford near the GSK offices.

I think the Nike creative is an interesting use of religious imagery.
Deliberately
[provocative](http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/organgrinder/2006/06/world_cup_advert_crucified.html)
but much better than the unimaginative, banal media advertising we
normally see in the UK although my wife was heard to mutter 'Ugly man,
ugly face, ugly poster'.
