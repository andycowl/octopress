I have upgraded this blog to the recently released WordPress
[2.3](http://wordpress.org/development/2007/09/wordpress-23/). However,
I have deep rooted concerns that the new tagging functionality will
simply overload my tiny brain.

The WordPress upgrade went smoothly enough although the editor now
reports a missing table (wp\_post2cat) which is slightly irritating.

Also, I sense increasing
[disquiet](http://wank.wordpress.com/2007/09/24/wp-phone-home/) amongst
some long standing, intelligent and loyal WordPress users so I took the
precaution of installing YABP (Yet Another Blog Platform). Please put
your hands together and welcome [Typo](http://www.nbrightside.com/typo/)
(powered by a delightful lady called 'Ruby on Rails').

Update: The Google Sitemap
[Generator](http://www.arnebrachhold.de/projects/wordpress-plugins/google-xml-sitemaps-generator/)
plug-in was causing the error. The problem is resolved in the latest
version.
