Recently noticed a couple of additional HD channels now available on
Virgin Media.

-   C4 - not that much of a bonus.
-   ESPN - will broadcast all the football matches previously screened
    by Setanta - in High Defintion - at no extra cost. Superb.

Slightly irritating that Virgin Media can send me a fun packed
newsletter (via email) but don't have a blog or sensible way of
communicating this useful information to me.
