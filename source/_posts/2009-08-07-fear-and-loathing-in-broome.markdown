As we meandered our way through Western Australia, we took a taxi from
the rather mediocre accommodation provided by '[Ocean
Lodge](http://www.oceanlodge.com.au/)' to Broome airport to fly back
home via Darwin.

As we turned a corner on a deserted road, an Aboriginal woman and her
daughter crossed the road in front of us. They looked up before crossing
and walked quickly across the road towards a school. It would have been
courteous for the taxi driver to have slowed down but he maintained his
speed and turned to me in the passenger seat:

> 'Damn - missed 'em. Maybe next time, eh ?'

I simply couldn't believe my ears. I looked at the driver's smiling face
and replied:
> 'Still - they were here first, weren't they ?'

An awkward silence followed. I could feel my wife's eyes drilling into
the back of my head and even the children looked a little uncomfortable
at the chilly atmosphere.

Cogs slowly turned. The driver paused and then retorted:
> 'Yeah - they were here first alright but that doesn't mean they should
> get an allowance to keep four dogs though.'

I'd dearly love to end the story with how I pointedly waited for the
racist, ignorant taxi driver to slowly and laboriously count out every
last 10 cents of my change for a $12.20 fare.

But I didn't - I gave him $15, grabbed our four heavy bags from the boot
and got out of that cab as fast as I possibly could.
