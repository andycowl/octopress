The Safari Web browser on Macintosh currently accounts for a paltry
4.34% of visits to this blog. It will be interesting to see whether this
figure increases now Apple have
[released](http://www.apple.com/safari/download/) a version of Safari
for Windows.

I've downloaded Safari and while I like the fonts and appearance, I
probably use too many Firefox add-ons to make the change permanently.
