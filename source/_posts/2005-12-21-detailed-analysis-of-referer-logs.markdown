Old news is like yesterday's papers. No-one is interested.

The chart of failed spammers is as good indicator of traffic to your
blog as any.

Old
[gems](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2005/12/19/a-brush-with-west-midlands-constabulary/)
may totally get ignored depending on timing.

I might have one avid [reader](http://oracledoug.com/serendipity/).

Lots of people are looking for information about 'Dixons Tax Free
Shopping', 'SonicStage 3.3' (are you listening, Sony ?) and, oddly
enough, 'Paul Scholes + family'.

Google is a popular but sub-optimal search engine for blogs as monthly
archives may contain a wide variety of unrelated content (Roy Keane,
Antibes, Blog, Chameleons, DAB) which will ultimately confuse people and
waste time.

Not many people will comment. Even fewer will link.
