Absolutely nobody writes in to ask: 'Norman - what fabulous, chart
topping, pop-tastic long playing records are on your Christmas list this
Yuletide ?'

1. Snow Patrol -
    [Eyes Open](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Eyes-Open-Snow-Patrol/dp/B000F5GJY6/sr=1-1/qid=1164980517/ref=sr_1_1/203-2869917-8143900?ie=UTF8&s=music)

    Pleasant enough. Why change a winning formula ? (see also R.E.M). Minor
    obsession with open and shut (Eyes Open, Open Your Eyes, Hands Open,
    Shut Your Eyes) and a nice contribution from ~~Kate Bush~~ Martha
    Wainwright on 'Set The Fire To The Third Bar'.

2. The Killers -
    [Sam's Town](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Sams-Town-Killers/dp/B000HDR9NG/sr=8-1/qid=1164980452/ref=pd_ka_1/203-2869917-8143900?ie=UTF8&s=music)
 
    An unbelievable disappointment. The warning signs were all there but I
    chose to ignore them; PH's disparaging
    [comments](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/09/11/the-killers/#comment-862),
    Brandon referring to this as The Killers 'concept album', the facial
    hair, the best music
    [reviewer](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/02/23/probably-the-best-music-review-in-the-world/)
    in the world likening 'When You Were Young' to Meatloaf.

    Even diehard fans advocate giving it time and a few listens. But with
    the possible exception of the title track, I can't. What had the
    potential ('All The Pretty Faces') to be absolutely superb is simply
    tedious beyond belief and irritating.

3. Nirvana -
    [In Utero](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Utero-Nirvana/dp/B0000072KY/sr=1-1/qid=1164985516/ref=sr_1_1/203-2869917-8143900?ie=UTF8&s=music).
    More then 10 years old but still sounds fresh and is vastly underrated.
    Required listening to cleanse oneself after the above torture.
    'Serve The Servants, Heart Shaped Box, Rape Me, Radio Friendly Unit
    Shifter, Frances Farmer, Dumb, Pennyroyal Tea'. Click 'Repeat'. Turn
    volume up.

    I must own up and admit that I only recently discovered there are hidden
    [tracks](http://www.completenirvana.co.uk/php/faq/#15) in the minutes of
    silence in the run off. Oh the shame.
