I travel quite a lot. I usually stay in decent hotels. I am fairly easy
to please. All I really need on my short visits is a clean bed and a
shower.

However, most of the hotels in Rotterdam (including the one I stayed in
last week where I could stroll down to the client offices - my idea of
nirvana) are fully booked for reasons that are unclear.

I have a feeling that there may be a major tulip festival taking place.
Either that or it is because (for reasons outside my control) I am being
forced to book at 24 hours notice.

In any event, after hours of hunting for a hotel room without success, I
asked the client for assistance and am pleased to announce that I now
have a confirmed booking for three nights at the Grand Hotel Central in
central Rotterdam.

Then I just happened to
[read](http://www.hotels.nl/rotterdam/grandhotel/) some
[reviews](http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g188632-d236031-Reviews-Grand_Hotel_Central-Rotterdam_Zuid_Holland.html)
on this establishment and I am really starting to wish I hadn't.
