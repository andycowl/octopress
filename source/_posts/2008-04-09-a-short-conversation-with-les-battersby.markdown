Met up with some friends last night in a very busy
[Freemasons Arms](http://www.beerintheevening.com/pubs/s/50/5069/Freemasons_Arms/Covent_Garden)
in Covent Garden.

[Les Battersby](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Battersby-Brown) (some
bloke from Coronation Street apparently) was drinking in there. Les
kindly and repeatedly passed our rounds of '6 Spitfire and 2 Guinness'
into our little alcove as we enjoyed Liverpool versus Arsenal.

> 'So, you're in Coronation Street then ?'  
> 'Yeah'  
> 'Red or blue ?'  
> 'Blue.'  
> 'Oh.'
