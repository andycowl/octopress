In August 2002, I visited Florida on holiday. In return for what seemed
like 7 successive days at theme parks in sweltering weather, my family
kindly allowed me a visit to the
[Kennedy Space Center](http://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/home/index.html)
which was a fantastic day out.

As luck would have it, a shuttle launch was actually scheduled during
our stay so I planned to drive out to the
[highway](http://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/about/view/view_shuttle.html)
to watch it. Unfortunately, the initial launch was postponed due to
inclement weather conditions so I sporadically checked the TV and radio
for the rearranged launch date and time.

One afternoon, I returned to the car and turned the radio on. I was
disappointed to hear that the shuttle had just launched. However, what
was infuriating was that I was only located a few miles away from KSC
and missed a once in a lifetime opportunity because I was, err,
shopping.

So, at the precise moment the space shuttle was blasting off into outer
space, I was traipsing around Wal-Mart, for reasons that now escape me,
hunting for a Phillips screwdriver, a pair of nail scissors and 4 AAA
batteries.
