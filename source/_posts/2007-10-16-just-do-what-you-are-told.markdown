'Hello John. Can I ask you a quick question ?'

'Well I'm onsite at a Red account in deepest Kazbakistan about to go

'Yeah. Hurry up. What's the actual problem ? Installation, performance,
database, network, security, clustering, defect, LDAP - what is it ?'

'Well it's an unusual one. It's the milk.'

'The milk. What on earth are you talking about ? Did you really say milk
?'

'Well, as I said, I'm currently in Asda and there is no milk.'

'For Christ's sake, you're calling to ask me a question about your

'Yeah. I really need milk and there isn't any.'

'Well obviously all the milk is sold out. Get fully skimmed or get 2

'But the milk isn't actually sold out. That's the weird thing.'

'Well if it isn't sold out, why is there no milk there ?'

'Mentions me. What do you mean - the sign mentions me ?'

'Shut up and listen'

'Look - can you hurry up ? The council of war is starting'

'Well just shut up and listen then.'
