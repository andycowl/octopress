I also enjoyed last night's 
'[Did they pay off their mortgage in two years ?](http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/proginfo/tv/wk2/unplaced.shtml#unplaced_mortgage)'
about a likable creative artist from Cornwall who makes interesting,
arty (and high margin) stoves from VW car parts aimed at rich people
in South Kensington.

The last minute of the
[show](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/01/20/recursive-financial-advice-from-the-bbc/)
was a real emotional roller coaster.

Firstly, I was delighted to hear the couple's hard work had showed an
unbelievable return of &pound;104,000 profit but then shattered to
hear they had fallen a paltry &pound;1,500 of being able to pay off
their mortgage in full.

My hopes rose again as 'international businessman and motivational
speaker, Rene Carayol' spontaneously (and very conveniently) purchased
a stove and handed them the &pound;1,500 in cash.

Then I started to laugh uncontrollably as I struggled to assimilate
Rene's closing words

> 'Congratulations. You have done it. You have paid your mortgage off.
> Now there's just one more small thing to do. Review the books and
> see how much you owe the tax man.'

So, although they paid their mortgage off, the couple are now saddled
with a sizable personal loan to clear their debts to the Inland
Revenue.
