Doug [Burns](http://oracledoug.com/serendipity/) has a new
[job](http://oracledoug.com/serendipity/index.php?/archives/1168-A-Fresh-Start.html)
and is spending some time in Canada, hugging his new colleagues. Like
most roving consultants holed up in lonely, bland, nondescript hotel
rooms with only an ironing board, TV and mini-bar for company (oh sorry
that's me not Doug), Doug's thoughts inevitably starts to turn to loved
ones back at home (including his cuddly toys and music collection).

Fed up with the banality of Radio Ottawa, Doug recently pleaded for
[suggestions](http://oracledoug.com/serendipity/index.php?/archives/1185-Singing-Songs.html)
and recommendations for new music. Unfortunately this desperate plea
met with a deathly silence from Oracle types purely interested in his
detailed investigations into the optimal degree of
[parallelism](http://oracledoug.com/serendipity/index.php?/archives/835-PX-and-the-Magic-of-2.html).

More recently, it would appear that homesickness coupled with the
extreme
[cold](http://oracledoug.com/serendipity/index.php?/archives/1189-A-Bit-Brisk,-Eh.html)
is affecting his brain. He is now listening to
'[The Proclaimers](http://oracledoug.com/serendipity/index.php?/archives/1190-While-The-Chief-....html)'
and viewing questionable videos on YouTube.

So, to preserve poor Doug's sanity and seed some new ideas, I have
painstakingly recorded full details of my vinyl record
[collection](http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=pHBwkjgvEIx7p__epg6YXYg)
which was sold to a second hand record shop last January for &pound;20.

Obviously, this eclectic collection merely reflects my antique
collection of vinyl so I also resurrected my last.fm
[account](http://www.last.fm/user/andycowl/) in an effort to reflect
more recent musical tastes.

Stay tuned for a complete listing of all my bootleg tapes in the next
exciting edition.
