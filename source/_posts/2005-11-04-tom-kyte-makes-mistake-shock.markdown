London, near England - Wednesday 2 November 2005

The Oracle community was reeling yesterday from the revelation that
the universally respected, internationally renown technical expert and
long standing Oracle employee,
[Thomas Kyte](http://tkyte.blogspot.com/), had made a mistake.

The error was discovered by a Senior Oracle DBA based in Solihull in
the UK, Mr. N. Brightside who explained:

> "I was dearly looking forward to attending the UK Oracle User Group
> in Birmingham and hoped to get my copy of Tom Kyte's latest book,
> (Expert Oracle - Database Architecture) signed by Tom
> personally. However, at the last minute, my manager told me that the
> end of Q3 was imminent and there was no budget available for the
> daily 4.50GBP return rail fare. So, I decided to 'work from home'
> and sit down to savour Tom's excellent
> [book](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1590595300/qid=1130415782/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl/202-3162097-9903838).
> Imagine my surprise when I found what appeared, at first sight, to
> be a typographical error on page 38. In a paragraph discussing other
> relational database systems, Tom incorrectly refers to 'Ingress'
> instead of '[Ingres](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingres/)'.  Then
> to my horror, a quick search on AskTom revealed that Tom makes this
> identical misspelling elsewhere. It was not a typo, it was a genuine
> mistake."

A spokesperson for Apress (the publisher of Kyte's book) commented:

> "Thank you for the feedback on Tom Kyte's book. We were unaware of
> this problem and will update the Errata section accordingly in due
> course. However, we did note Tom had a tendency to use a mixture of
> 'Apres', 'Apress' and 'Apresss' in communications while writing the
> book. We attributed this to the long hours he was working on the
> book, the tight deadlines or a faulty auto-repeating 'S' key.  When
> we politely brought this to his attention, he was absolutely
> mortified and apologised profusely for the inconvenience (additional
> hard parses, increased latching and CPU utilisation) caused.
> Thereafter, he would only refer to the company as ':B1 Publishing'."

Tom Kyte was quick to acknowledge the error and said he was only too
pleased to correct the problem although he thought all the fuss and
extra work involved was rather a 'bind'.

Don Burlesson was unavailable for comment but sources reported he was
'absolutely ecstatic at the news'.
