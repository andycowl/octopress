Just remembered that I was 'shocked and ashamed to discover' that my
father (Silver Surfer) was using
[IE7](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/default.mspx) when I last took
my laundry home so I felt obliged to upgrade from IE6.

I also took the opportunity to upgrade to Firefox [2.0
RC2](http://www.mozilla.org/projects/bonecho/all-rc.html) from 1.5.0.7.

No detailed, lengthy reviews, I'm afraid. I did notice some changes to
the user interface (IE now looks like Firefox 1.x) but most importantly,
all my Firefox extensions still appear to work.
