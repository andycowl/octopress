I have tried many times, in many different places, to articluate the
idea that micro-blogging reduces ones blogging output but
[Russell Beattie](http://www.russellbeattie.com/blog/about)
completely expresses my thoughts on the subject in this brilliant
[article](http://www.russellbeattie.com/blog/tweets-kill-that-blogging-urge).

I can completely identify with this statement and another sentence also
struck a resounding chord with me:

I think this is so true. Occasionally, I may dig up an old blog post to
refer to. Why sometimes, in a lonely hotel room, I may even just scan my
blog archives - just for my own enjoyment.

However, I never, ever revisit any of my inane drivel posted on Twitter,
Jaiku or even identi.ca. As I once (apparently)

That's not to say micro-blogging doesn't have a place or isn't valuable,
merely that proper, grown up blogging has more value and longevity which
makes perfect sense. The more you put in, the more you get out.
