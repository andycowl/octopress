I admire Wayne Rooney's skills as a footballer and I honestly don't give
a flying fig about his sordid, personal life. Unfortunately, I don't
think Wayne Rooney is blessed with that much intelligence. This isn't a
criticism, merely a statement of fact.

If Alex Ferguson says the sky is green, then the sky is green. If Alex
Ferguson says you have an [ankle injury][], then you have an ankle
injury.

Sadly, for Rooney and Manchester United, I sense the writing might now
be indelibly marked on the wall for his career at Manchester United.

Rooney should just ask Beckham, Keane, Stam and van Nistelrooy.
