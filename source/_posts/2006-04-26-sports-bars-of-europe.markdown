People often ask me "Norman - when will you be updating your
award-winning 'Sport bars of Europe 'meme' ?"

No. 2 - The [Irish Rover](http://www.the-irish-rover.com/HTML/Home.htm)
- Stroget, Copenhagen

Satellite feed - RTE. Thankfully, we were spared Tyler's orgasmic 'ON -
REEE !'

Food feed - Irish Rover Burger (inevitably). Just like a standard burger
in a English pub.

Smoke feed - Intense. Peaked around the time of the missed penalty.

Beer feed - Carls Special and Tuborg substituted at half-time for Leffe.

Game feed - A team in yellow outplayed and outclassed a team in red. The
team in yellow had a goal disallowed and missed a penalty. The team in
red appeared to win overall.
