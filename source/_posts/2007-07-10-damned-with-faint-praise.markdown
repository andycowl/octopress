My son, Norman Junior III, plays competitive junior tennis. When I
[watch](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/10/25/celebrity-watch-2/)
him play, I tend to stand at a distance and remain completely silent.
Outwardly at least. I always try to offer positive encouragement -
congratulations if he wins and commiserations after a defeat.

My son wins some matches and loses a handful more. However, he always
enjoys playing, he doesn't scream and shout or thrash his racket into
the ground. He wins and loses with the same good grace which makes me
just as proud as his sporting prowess.

However, recently, he was given a real hiding by a lad of a similar age,
ranking and ability. When he came off, I said 'Jesus. If you're going to
play and serve like that, I think even I could take a set off you.' I
always call him 'Jesus' when I am cross with him.

This lunchtime, work and school commitments finally allowed the great
Brightside veteran-junior invitational challenge to take place.

He thrashed me 6-0. I took him to a couple of deuces but only because he
made a couple of unforced errors and threw in a few double faults. When
Sue Barker interviewed me, in a sweaty and breathless state (me not Sue)
immediately afterwards, she made the preposterous claim that I only made
two outright winners during the whole 24 minutes.

When I asked my son for tips to improve my all-round game, he graciously
replied

> 'You actually weren't as bad I thought. You did get some serves in.'

I may have lost but I can tell you, I really looked the part as I
strolled out onto court 14, immaculately

in cream [flannels](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_pictures/6282844.stm),
cream blazer with a cream holdall embossed in gold lettering with 'NB'.

We then adjourned to Asda for an emergency purchase (toilet rolls) and I
cheered myself up with the purchase of
[Editors](http://www.editorsofficial.com/)
'[An End Has a Start](http://www.amazon.co.uk/End-Has-Start-Editors/dp/B000PUAZDW/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/202-9208489-4082238?ie=UTF8&s=music&qid=1184074770&sr=8-1)'.
This CD has been on my wishlist for a whole but I have been poised on
tenterhooks, waiting for
[Doug Burns](http://oracledoug.com/serendipity/)
to divulge his innermost thoughts on this indie band but, sorry, Doug,
I simply can not bear the suspense any longer.

I see [Interpol'](http://www.interpolnyc.com/)s third album
('[Our Love To Admire](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Our-Love-Admire-Interpol/dp/B000R7HQVW/ref=sr_1_1/202-9208489-4082238?ie=UTF8&s=music&qid=1184074858&sr=1-1)')
is also out which has received negative reviews for being too similar to
the previous two with vivid echoes of Joy Division so that has also been
ordered.
