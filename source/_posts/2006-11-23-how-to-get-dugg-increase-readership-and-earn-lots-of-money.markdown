[Engtech](http://engtech.wordpress.com/) has some great
[references](http://engtech.wordpress.com/2006/11/22/the-secret-to-blog-success-is-in-the-title/)
stressing the importance of the blog title when trying to attract
readers.

However, this merely confirms what I already knew. A couple of weeks
ago, I posted this
[entry](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/11/09/361-days-to-go/)
which brought a trickle of traffic from
[TailRank](http://tailrank.com//811278/Backside-firework-prank-backfires).
This, in turn, brought another
[article](http://iscatterlings.com/2006/11/09/black-cat-peanutbutter-no-black-cat-thunderbolt-rocket-up-the-arse/)
about the same news story to my attention.

My post was titled: '361 days to go'

The other article was titled: 'Black Cat Thunderbolt Rocket Up The Arse'

Some of us have it. Some of us don't.
