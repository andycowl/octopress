Don't know where, don't know when but SonicStage 3.4 is
[available](http://www.sonydigital-link.com/DNA/sonicstage/sstage_dl.asp?r=&l=en).

I haven't had a chance to download 3.4 yet and I would love to be proved
wrong but I suspect SonicStage remains the only software application in
the modern world without a â€˜Check for updates' option.

Irritatingly, this
[post](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2005/12/01/sonicstage-33-released/)
about version 3.3 remains one of my most popular blog articles. Sigh.
