Don't know where, don't know when but SonicStage 3.3 is
[available](http://www.sonydigital-link.com/DNA/sonicstage/sstage_dl.asp?r=&l=en).

Includes ATRAC Lossless format, ripping WMA CD's, wider range of
bitrates for ATRAC3Plus and MP3.

However, SonicStage remains the only software application in the modern
world without a 'Check for updates' option.
