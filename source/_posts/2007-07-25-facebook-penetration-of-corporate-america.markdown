I was interested to
[read](http://blogs.technet.com/seanearp/archive/2007/07/21/how-many-microsoft-employees-does-it-take-to.aspx)
that Microsoft have over 17,597 employees registered on
[Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/) out of a total of 70,000 employees.

I thought I would try to discover how other leading IT companies
compared, including my own. The staff numbers come from Google
[Finance](http://finance.google.com/ "Finance") and the rounding errors
come from me.

The following Facebook networks are only open to company employees with
a valid email address although, obviously, a better metric would have
been some measure of recent activity.

  ----------- ----------- ---------- ---------------
  Company     Employees   Facebook   FB factor (%)
  Google      10,674      5,545      51.9
  Yahoo!      11,400      3,911      34.3
  Microsoft   71,000      17,980     25.3
  Sun         14,000      2,942      21.0
  IBM         355,766     23,400     6.6
  Oracle      74,674      4,280      5.7
  SAP         41,919      2,300      5.4
  HP          186,000     9,742      5.2
  Intel       90,300      4,219      4.7
  ----------- ----------- ---------- ---------------

Inevitably, I guess - Google lead the way (again) but I was surprised to
see that Sun Microsystems have a significant proportion of Facebook
members.

IBM were slightly lower than I expected until I remembered that half
their 350,000 employees are
[busy](http://andypiper.wordpress.com/2007/01/26/second-life-is-work/)
building fantasy worlds in Second Life. No wonder I can't get spare
parts for my Thinkpad.

Nice to see Oracle positioned just ahead of SAP after recent
[discussions](http://www.web-strategist.com/blog/2007/04/27/dear-oracle-bloggers-host-a-lunch-20/ "discussions")
about the companies' respective contributions and reputation in the Web
2.0 community.

I still have wildly oscillating feelings about Facebook; on one hand, a
walled garden, puerile, teenage and gimmicky but undoubtedly an
insidious, strangely compulsive and probably important platform.

PS. For example, I have just seen the immortal words 'Andy and Mark
Burgess (The Chameleons) are now friends'. Superb.
