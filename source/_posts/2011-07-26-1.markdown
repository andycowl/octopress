Seasoned bloggers knows people are rarely moved to comment on a blog
post. Especially, one hit wonders sent from Google, who were simply
looking for 'Train times between Clapham and Norbiton' and instead see
some commuter
[rant](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2011/01/13/open-letter-south-west-trains/)
aimed at South West Trains.

However, microblogging has taught us that people are slightly more
likely to grudgingly acknowledge an amusing one-liner with a 'Like' or
a 'Fave'. Clicking a button is quick and easy - even for lazy people.

The recently launched Google Plus also uses '+1' both for posts and -
probably the single feature I like most of all in Google Plus - the
ability to add '+1' on individual comments.

I always equate this with a knowing smile across a crowded room - just
to say "I saw what you did there. It made me smile but it's not worthy
of a reply to say 'Hey - that clever bit of word play made me smile'
but have a 'Like'".

As Drupal 7 has a Google +1
[module](http://drupal.org/project/google_plusone) available and
Google
[Webmaster Tools](http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/?hl=en)
includes reports to track this metric, I thought I'd add a '+1' button
to every single post on this blog.

Now - you know what you have to do. Even if you were just hunting for
train times.
