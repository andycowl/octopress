Sometimes, your offspring know more then you do. For example, my son is
a wizard at dragging, resizing and cropping photographs in a Word
document. This is a seemingly simple task but can quite literally take
me hours and drive me to the edge of despair.

Occasionally, however, you know more than your offspring. For example,
my son had assembled a pile of CD's and was searching for copies of the
same MP3 tracks on the Internet. I then showed him that it would be
easier and quicker simply to insert the CD into the computer and click
'Import CD'.
