Google have launched an online RSS
[Reader](http://www.google.com/reader/things/tour). Like most
developments from Google, this looks very professional and fits in
with their rapidly growing suite of software products. Although I
currently use Thunderbird for reading (a very limited number of) RSS
sources and blogs, the use of a Web based service to manage all my
information sources, accessible from anywhere, is appealing.

I experimented by setting up one source (BBC News) and one thing about
the interface immediately struck me like a thunderbolt !

The use of the 'j' and 'k' keys to move the article list up and
down. It is just like the good old trusty (and much maligned) Unix
editor 'vi'.  Now this may appeal to Unix users but I am not sure
whether the new generation of IE users will make of the 'oh but for
touch typists, it is so much faster' argument.
