The Chameleons used to cover ATV's 'Splitting in Two' for an encore. Reg
(guitar) played the drums and John (drums) played bass. Mark Burgess
threw himself into the crowd and chaos ensued.

Burgess also used to improvise snippets of The Fall's 'Rowche Rumble'
and occaisionally Joy Division's Love Will Tear Us Apart and some
Beatles tune.

8 minutes of pure, manic, unsurpassed joy.

I once asked Mark Perry of ATV (via email) what he thought of the cover.
He replied that he loved it and had even guested with The Chameleons for
an encore at a gig at The Lesser Free Trade Hall.
