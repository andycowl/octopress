Thankfully, Scoble has finally found the
'[Disable Snap](http://scobleizer.com/2007/01/30/i-removed-snaps-previews-from-here/)'
button on his WP
[dashboard](http://flickr.com/photos/70276096@N00/375498720/). Only
another 641,000 WordPress blogs to go.

If you don't know what I am talking about, just explore Jonathan Lewis'
excellent Wordpress [blog](http://jonathanlewis.wordpress.com/) and see
how long you last before exploding. [Hint: hover over a hyperlink]

If you can't be bothered, look
[here](http://flickr.com/photos/70276096@N00/375494574/) although a
screenshot can't do justice to the mind numbing effect and irritation
factor.

[Tom Raftery](http://www.tomrafteryit.net/) also notes the presence of
the dreaded [Snap](http://www.tomrafteryit.net/annoying-snaps/) preview
and asks for opinions. In fact, this post started out as a comment on
Tom's blog but I think this now merits a full-blown rant.

> WordPress.com added
> [Snap](http://wordpress.com/blog/2007/01/13/snap-live/) functionality
> for all users (default=TRUE). To be fair, following lots of user
> [feedback](http://wank.wordpress.com/2007/01/14/snappish/)
> (surprisingly not all of it positive), WordPress made Snap a
> configurable option so users could disable the damned distracting
> Adware popups.

> Judging by the number of WP blogs still displaying them, it appears
> the default is still enabled.

> I think WordPress and Snap are great friends in the Web 2.0 sense but

> I would pay WordPress good money to disable Snap. Permanently. Maybe a
> new business model presents itself.
