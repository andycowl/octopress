A kind gentleman (on The Chameleons
[forums](http://forums.thechameleons.com/)) once reviewed
'[Interpol](http://www.interpolnyc.com/)'s 'Antics' thus:

> No thanks. If I want to listen to 
> [Joy Division](http://andycowl.googlepages.com/), I will put 'Unknown
> Pleasures' on.

A worthy review which introduced me to one of my favourite bands.
He also followed up more recently by reviewing 'The Back Room' by 
[The Editors](http://www.editorsofficial.com/) as follows:

> No thanks. If I want to listen to Interpol, I will put 'Antics' on.

The jury is still out on this one but worth listening to, I think.
Thanks again.

I am currently poised waiting for his thoughts on the
[Arctic Monkeys](http://www.arcticmonkeys.com/). However, worringly,
he has been a little quiet of late. I wonder if he got a job with NME.
