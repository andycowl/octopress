Since the [Regulus](http://www.binarymoon.co.uk/projects/regulus/) theme
was
[added](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2005/11/29/new-regulus-theme-for-wordpresscom/)
to WordPress last November, I have stuck with it through thick and thin,
for richer for poorer, through sickness and in health.

Lots of themes have subsequently been introduced to Wordpress and I
always preview each of them but none of them look as easy on the eye and
as functional as Regulus.

However, I must say that the recently
[added](http://wordpress.com/blog/2006/03/18/andreas04-and-thirteen/)
'Andreas04' theme is very attractive and had me dithering for a moment.
You can see this theme in action, down under, at
[squash.wordpress.com](http://squash.wordpress.com/), by Phil Sim, who
was obviously similarly impressed.
