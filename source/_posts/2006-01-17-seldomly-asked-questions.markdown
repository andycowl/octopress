People never ask me 'Just who is this Norman Brightside character ?'

'Norman Brightside' is an alias for a fictitious Oracle Database
Administrator based in Solihull, near England. Norman briefly flirted
with celebrity, last year, when he had the temerity to
[criticise](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2005/11/04/tom-kyte-makes-mistake-shock/)
Tom Kyte.

Norman Brightside is also a bastardisation of Norman Whiteside, a
Northern Irish footballer who played for Manchester United in the 80's
and the song 'Mr. Brightside' by the popular American beat combo - The
Killers.
