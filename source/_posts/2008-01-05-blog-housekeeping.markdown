-   Upgraded to WordPress
    [2.3.2](http://wordpress.org/development/2007/12/wordpress-232/)
-   [Plaintxt](http://www.plaintxt.org/themes/plaintxtblog/) theme
    upgraded to v4.0. The main change is tag support which I don't
    currently use.
-   Reinstated the 'Related Posts'
    [plugin](http://wasabi.pbwiki.com/Related%20Entries) because I
    couldn't understand why people looking for information on Virgin
    Media/V+ don't scan other relevant posts. Already seeing a benefit.
-   Added useful
    [plugin](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/youtube-brackets/) to
    support embedded YouTube videos to liven up my monochrome
    [posts](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2008/01/03/idiots-guide-to-oracle-installation/).
