I was seriously considering selling all my stock options and purchasing a 1GB USB memory <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000AQFD42/qid=1145490535/sr=8-2/ref=pd_ka_2/202-2505147-5837430">stick</a> for an amazing 30 GBP.
</p>
<p>
Then I thought I would get an account at <a href="http://www.box.net/">box.net</a> and upload all the precious files, that my wife sadly lost when my hard disk died a couple of years ago, there instead. This has the advantages that if I ever need to take my memory stick to Seattle to show Auntie Rita, this will be possible, I won&#39;t be able to leave the memory stick in a client&#39;s PC in Eastern Europe and, finally, it will cost me 30 GBP less.
</p>
<p>
I haven&#39;t used the box.net service much but there is a nice drag&#39;n&#39;drop interface for uploading folders and multiple files and it seems intuitive and quick. There is a free 1GB service available and you pay for additional storage which seems fair enough.
</p>
<p>
If you are interested in trying out the box.net service, then please, please click <a href="http://www.box.net/signup/invitation/andycowl@gmail.com">HERE!</a> (so I can upgrade to the Deluxe, Premium, Gold 512GB service free of charge) as all the worst Web sites (used to) say.
