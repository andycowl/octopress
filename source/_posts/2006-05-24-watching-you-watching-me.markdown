The more observant among you will have noticed the addition of a
[StatCounter](http://www.statcounter.com/) button to the sidebar.

The available StatCounter metrics are quite basic as the hosted
Wordpress blog is limited to the HTML (not the Javascript) version of
the tracking code. So advanced features like path analysis and keywords
are not available but the reports do include domain information,
breakdown of unique and returning visitors, visit length, pages per
visit and browser metrics.

Combined with the statistics on the WordPress dashboard which do include
the referrer and search engine, you get a pretty complete picture of
traffic. The StatCounter reports also go back indefinitely compared to
the 30 days on WordPress.

It would be neat if WordPress could open up more of the Google
[Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/) functionality so all the
reports were under one roof.

Guess what. Most people glance at one page and stay for less than a
second.
