My long suffering wife and I celebrate our wedding anniversary every
year in July.

To mark this momentous milestone, ~~I buy her flowers, chocolate,
champagne and book a corner table at our favourite restaurant~~, the
wife takes the kids camping in the New Forest with her girlfriends while
I make the annual pilgrimage to the Hook Norton
[Festival](http://www.hookybeerfest.co.uk/) of Fine Ales with my mates.

So, if you'd like to read something from me in a different style, full
match reports for the

and
[2003](http://goathurling.blogspot.com/2003_07_01_goathurling_archive.html#105907557962806664)
festivals are already available online together with photos of a human
[pyramid](http://www.flickr.com/photos/25633426@N00/31142547/). We
even have our own
[stalker](http://www2.flickr.com/photos/mymuk/28264243/).

So, it transpires that my first blog article was actually written four
years ago - not just a personal web journal but collaborative blogging
(Blogger) and social networking (Flickr) and I didn't even know it.
