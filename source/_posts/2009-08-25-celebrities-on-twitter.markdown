Janet Street Porter calling me a 'twat'. Possibly my [proudest
moment](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/01/23/my-proudest-moment).

I prefer to define µblogging as 'an infinite byte stream of inane
drivel' but I also enjoyed Stephen Fry's
[post](http://www.stephenfry.com/2009/08/18/pointless-babble/) on the
same subject:
