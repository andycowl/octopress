Thursday 15 May - Manchester, near England

107,239 hungover Rangers' supporters (and an exiled Scotsman who drove
up from Coventry) firmly blamed Great Manchester Police for last night's
scenes of fighting, violent disorder and urinating in the street.

One fan, Jimmy 'Och Aye Jimmy' McTavish from Glasgow, claimed:
> 'Everyone was having a great time in Piccadilly Gardens, sunbathing,
> drinking and joking around with the police.
>
> At 19:35, everyone went to the toilet, big Gordon put the kettle on,
> Doug popped out for popcorn and we all sat down to enjoy Rangers'
> biggest game in 36 years on the big screen.
>
> Then, without any warning, the police switched channels to 'Coronation
> Street'. That's when it all kicked off.'
