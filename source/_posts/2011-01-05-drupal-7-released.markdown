This blog and the handful of
[modules](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2010/12/22/essential-modules-your-new-drupal-7-site/)
I use has been upgraded to the final version of Drupal 7.0 which was
[released](http://drupal.org/drupal-7.0) today.

I was quite pleased that I used Drupal 7 from the early beta versions
and then tracked the D7 release candidates as this gave me valuable
experience in upgrading Drupal 7 relatively quickly while preserving
my additional modules without losing all my data which always
helps. It's worth noting that although I barely scratch the surface of
Drupal 7's wide range of functionality, the quality, reliability and
performance of Drupal 7 was perfectly fine for this blog.

Personally (and rather selfishly), I hope that the formal release of
Drupal 7.0 will encourage more developers to upgrade which, in turn,
which provide impetus for more Drupal modules (and themes) to be
ported and made available for Drupal 7.

predictions for the coming year for:
