Apart from the 'vi'
[shortcuts](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2005/10/10/google-reader/),
I was slightly underwhelmed by Google
[Reader](http://www.google.com/reader) when it was released last year.

Imagine my surprise, when I just used Google Reader to quickly check
that I had reinstated full text feeds for this blog. Unless I see it
with my own eyes, I just don't believe it.

Google Reader launches with a modest splash screen with some exciting
announcement (which I immediately skipped) and I was greeted by some
unexpected and welcome changes to the interface.

All my feeds appear in a
[hierarchy](http://flickr.com/photos/70276096@N00/255209620/) grouped by
'label'. However, I must admit I am confused. They used to be 'labels'.
Now it appears 'labels' are dead and my categories are 'folders' or
'tags' depending on the context.

Google has also added:

-   Shared articles (but not grouped feeds)
-   Reading feeds via bookmarks which is an interesting idea
-   Integration with Google Homepage
-   Quick subscribe
-   Support for mobile phones (err, no thanks)

Even more strange is the fact I have happened upon something brand new
all by myself.

Nothing on the blogs which I just scanned a minute ago. Nothing on
Technorati. Nothing from Robert Scoble. Nothing on the RSS related
blogs. No text message from the wife. Nothing on the Google blog. No IM
from my son. Nothing on the Google Reader blog. Nothing on digg. Nothing
on reddit. Nothing on del.ici.ous.

This is it. I am finally going be famous. My 15 minutes is here. I am
going to be dugg and the WordPress servers will creak under the strain.

Apart from the fact it took me 7 minutes to compose these words, by
which time this exciting Web 2.0 development will be yesterday's vinegar
stained fish'n'chip paper.
