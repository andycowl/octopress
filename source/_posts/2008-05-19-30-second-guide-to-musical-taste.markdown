Since I started blogging, three intelligent friends have complimented me
on my musical taste and 123 people have accused me of being stuck in an
‘manic depressive, 80’s time warp’. Obviously, this is preferable to
being told you have abysmal taste in music and started me thinking. So
here is another in the very occasional and popular ‘30 second’ series:

-   ‘Superlative’ - You love everything I love. You despise everything I
    despise and I have actually discovered new bands from your
    recommendation engine.
-   ‘Unexpectedly good’ - You love ‘The Chameleons’ who broke up before
    you were even born.
-   ‘Excellent’ - You like everything I like and you hate everything I
    hate.
-   ‘Mixed’ - You like Devo.
-   ‘Eclectic’ - as above but also includes [Test Department][].
-   ‘80’s time warp’ - Admirable but no overlap with my own particular
    80’s time warp.
-   ‘Dinner party music’ - You tend to overindulge when hosting a dinner
    party and reach for Dire Straits ‘Brothers in Arms’.
-   ‘Esoteric’ - You like a Devo song and it isn’t even ‘Are we not men
    ?’
-   ‘70’s time warp’ - You have a penchant for vinyl, Pink Floyd and Led
    Zeppelin. Seek medical help immediately.
-   ‘Unbelievably varied’ - Your name (pseudonym alert) is [Ontario Emperor][].
