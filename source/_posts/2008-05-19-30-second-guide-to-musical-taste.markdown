Since I started blogging, three intelligent friends have complimented me on my musical taste and 123 people have accused me of being stuck in an 'manic depressive, 80's time warp'.
<p>
Obviously, this is preferable to being told you have abysmal taste in music and started me thinking.
<p>
So here is another in the very occasional and popular '30 second' series:
<ul>
<li>'Superlative' - You love everything I love. You despise everything I despise and I have actually discovered new bands from your recommendation engine.</li>
<li>'Unexpectedly good' - You love 'The Chameleons' who broke up before you were even born.</li>
<li>'Excellent' - You like everything I like and you hate everything I hate.</li>
<li>'Mixed' - You like Devo.</li>
<li>'Eclectic' - as above but also includes <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_Dept'>Test Department</a>.</li>
<li>'80's time warp' - Admirable but no overlap with my own particular 80's time warp.</li>
<li>'Dinner party music' - You tend to overindulge when hosting a dinner party and reach for Dire Straits 'Brothers in Arms'.</li>
<li>'Esoteric' - You like a Devo song and it isn't even 'Are we not men ?'</li>
<li>'70's time warp' - You have a penchant for vinyl, Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin. Seek medical help immediately.</li>
<li>'Unbelievably varied' - Your name (pseudonym alert) is <a href='http://www.last.fm/user/ontarioemperor/'>Ontario Emperor</a>.</li>
</ul>
