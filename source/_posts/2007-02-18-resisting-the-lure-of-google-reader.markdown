I am a big fan of
[Netvibes](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/05/25/good-vibes-from-netvibes/)
but also follow the ongoing
[development](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/01/06/google-reader-adds-stats-on-rss-habits/)
of Google
[Reader](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/09/28/google-reader-gets-revamp/)
with interest. Increasingly, I find myself tempted to convert to
[Reader](http://www.google.com/help/reader/help.html) permanently.

-   Speed - Google Reader has a set of keyboard shortcuts that make
    scanning a large number of feeds quick. Really quick. While Netvibes
    also offers keyboard
    [shortcuts](http://eco.netvibes.com/help/keyboard), out of habit, I
    tend to use mouse-clicks to navigate between tabs and articles.
-   Flexibility - You can read related blogs that are grouped together
    (e.g. Oracle, Wordpress), read an individual blog or quickly skim
    over a river of news.
-   Sharing - Occasionally, I want to save an article for future
    reference or potentially sharing with others. These items might be
    interesting or useful snippets of information quickly noted in
    passing which I wouldn't necessarily blog about. The most obvious
    place to mark these items is right here in the RSS reader as opposed
    to a static bookmark. The list should (obviously) be visible as an
    RSS feed. Google's shared and starred items make this easy (single
    keystroke).
-   Flexible interface - I really like the full screen mode and the
    options for 'list view' where articles are condensed apart from the
    current article and 'expanded view' (all articles are expanded).
-   Statistics - I can't decide whether the trends page about your
    personal reading habits may actually be useful or just a gimmick.

Here's a Flickr
[set](http://www.flickr.com/photos/70276096@N00/sets/72157594542180535/detail/)
of annotated screenshots to illustrate the functionality in Google
Reader and the flexibility of the interface.
I think the recent addition of
[subscriber](http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2007/02/one-subscriber-two-subscribers-three.html)
counts to Google Reader will show that Reader has a substantial and
rapidly growing share of the RSS reader market. Stowe
[Boyd](http://www.stoweboyd.com/message/2007/02/big_spike_in_fe.html)
and Tom
[Raftery](http://www.tomrafteryit.net/1000-subscribers-and-no-free-pint/)
are already noting a Feedburner
[spike](http://blogs.feedburner.com/feedburner/archives/2007/02/the_google_effect.php)
as a result.

Interestingly, Darren Rowse notes that subscribers from Google
Reader/Desktop/IG already heavily
[outnumber](http://www.problogger.net/archives/2007/02/18/google-reader-starts-reporting-subscriber-numbers-and-shows-how-much-ground-theyve-taken-from-bloglines/)
the established and popular Bloglines reader.

Looking forward, one feature I would really like to see in Google Reader
is feed discovery and recommendations based on readers with common
interests and similar reading lists.
