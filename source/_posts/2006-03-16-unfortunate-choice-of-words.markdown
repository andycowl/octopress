There is a terribly sad
[story](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/london/4811626.stm)
in the UK about clinical trials that have gone (badly) wrong leaving six
people critically ill in hospital.

Radio 5 carried an interview with a person who has taken part in
previous trials. He was so full of praise for Parexel that I thought he
was a stooge.

That was, until, he uttered the unfortunate words
> 'So, 1,000 GBP for one trial and 750 GBP for the second. For a
> student, that is a lot of money and can actually be life-changing'
