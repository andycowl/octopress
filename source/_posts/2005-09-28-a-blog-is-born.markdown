According to
[Technorati](http://www.technorati.com/weblog/2005/08/34.html), a new
Web log is created every second which is an amazing statistic and
about 55% remain active which is even more staggering.

The creation of my blog was actually a little experiment to see what
all the fuss was about and, secondly, to see how long it would take
for someone to wander along and be motivated enough to add a comment
to the blog.

I did not publicise the blog in any way (mainly because I haven't got
any friends) apart from adding it to blogger listing and I was curious
to see if it would ever generate any traffic or interest.

So today, one month and eleven days after I created this blog, I
received the first comment from someone in Germany. My life is
complete - almost.
