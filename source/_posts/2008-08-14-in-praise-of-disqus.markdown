Disqus recently released a
[update](http://blog.disqus.net/2008/08/12/introducing-the-new-disqus/)
which includes the ability to export comments on a WordPress blog so I
have just exported all historic comments left on this blog (when it was
running WordPress) into Disqus.

This operation was slightly complicated because this blog now uses
Habari but the necessary steps were:

1.  Download and install the new Disqus 2.0
    [plugin](http://media.disqus.com/disqus-wordpress-2.0.zip) for
    Wordpress.
2.  Delete all obvious spam so the export only processes genuine
    comments and runs faster.
3.  Switch the archived WordPress copy of the blog back to the original
    location.
4.  Export all comments from WordPress into Disqus.
5.  Claim comments left by myself using an alternative email address
    before I had even heard about Disqus.
6.  Wrap the WordPress blog in cling-film, label and place back into
    cryogenic storage.
7.  Reinstate the Habari blog.

However, because I am pretty stupid and overly hasty, inevitably I
omitted step 3. This meant that while all comments appeared on the
Disqus site, the permalinks to the individual blog articles were
incorrect and referenced '/wordpress/' instead of '/blog/'.

As it wasn't obvious how to rectify this issue or perform a selective
bulk delete so I could repeat the process, I sent an email to Disqus
support explaining the problem and asking for help.

24 minutes later, Jason from Disqus emailed me saying he'd fixed all the
URL's.

What a fantastic service. What a fantastic product. What fanastic
people.

So now I can put the kettle on and reaquaint myself with 886 comments
(including some old friends) that have now been restored to their
rightful place.

The only gap that remains is that a relatively small number of comments
left on my blog after the Habari migration and prior to the adoption of
Disqus are not currently visible. Hopefully, when the Disqus API is
fully released, even this may be possible.
