At the weekend, I purchased a new printer after replacing the ink
cartridges failed to reinstate the ability to print in black on my Canon
IP4000.

Previously, I'd researched which printers had decent Linux support and
decided on an [HP Deskjet 3050][]. This is a wireless printer so I hoped
that the Windows PC's in the house would be able to print directly and
the management of the printer (inkjet levels) would be easier. My
current Canon IP4000 has served me well but is pretty old and I was
surprised to find I could pick up an HP wireless printer for &pound;34.

I checked the price on Amazon to find the price has risen to &pound;38.99 in
the intervening two weeks - not just at Amazon but at all online
retailers I normally use. No problem - still excellent value. As Norma
is patiently waiting to submit a couple of essays for her course, I
decided to venture out to try to buy a printer as delivery times from
Amazon could be delayed given the recent cold spell.

I walked into Comet - the HP Deskjet 3050 was on the shelf listed at
the price I'd originally seen - &pound;34.00. I darted next door to a
cavernous PC World which is the size of a aircraft hanger and a gadget
heaven. They also had the printer but now at the higher price of
&pound;38.99.

I went back to Comet, picked up the last remaining Deskjet box and
walked up to the till. The girl swiped the barcode and said (much as I
expected) - 'That will be &pound;38.99, Sir'. 'Oh I think that's a
mistake - it's listed as &pound;34.00 on the display'. 'No, sorry,
Sir. It's coming up on the computer as &pound;38.99'. 'Sorry but the
price on the display is &pound;34.00 and you have to charge me that
price for the printer. It’s the law'.

She interrupted me ‘Well I will have to see this for myself. Can you
show me ?' So we both ambled over to the display area of various
printers. The shop assistant wasn't best pleased and she muttered ‘Are
you absolutely sure it's the same printer, the same make and model ?'

We arrived at the display item for the HP DeskJet 3050 printer where the
price was displayed as clear as day, in black and white as &pound;34.00. She
turned back towards the till without a word so I duly followed, feeling
slightly guilty.

'Right then, Sir'. And she entered a manual override for the price and
entered &pound;34.99. That will be ‘&pound;34.99 please'. ‘But the
price is &pound;34 dead, &pound;34 exactly'. 'Was it ?' By now my
patience and my good humour at finding the desired printer in stock
and saving &pound;5 was being tempered by this girl's surly and
unhelpful attitude.

‘Listen. We've just walked over to check the price. We did that because
I know what the price is but you don't. Didn't you even look at the
price ? What was the point of going over if you're can't be bothered
looking at the price?'

‘So you're really going to argue with me over 99p are you ? I've already
keyed it now.'

'Yes - because the price is &pound;34.' She emitted a long sigh under her
breath and she entered the correct price and I proferred my credit card.

And now in a voice scarily reminiscent of Catherine Tate as the TGI
waitress; ‘Would you be wanting extended insurance cover with that, at
all, Sir ?'. 'Oh no - thanks - just the printer, thanks.' 'Insurance
cover is available for just &pound;24.99 for 3 years and &pound;34.99
for a full, comprehensive 5 years peace of mind'.

'I’m not really likely to insure something that cost me &pound;34 for
&pound;35. If it blows up after 1 year and 1 day, I’d just buy another
printer that is likely to be better, faster and probably cheaper.'

‘Well that's entirely up to you, Sir but these printers can be quite
unreliable.'

'No really. Just the printer thanks'. 'Right - so that’ll be &pound;34.00 for
the printer then.'

I went to nudge the printer box towards me in a precursor to leaving
this godforsaken store and erasing this girl's morose, stupid, miserable
face from my memory bank. For ever.

‘Can I interest you in more ink cartridges, Sir ? Special offer in
December on all inkjets - buy one set of ink and get another one at half
price.'

‘No thanks. I normally get my cartridges off the Internet.'

‘OK, Sir. That's entirely up to you but I must tell you that printers
only come with a 'starter pack' which only print 50 pages or so so you
might run out very quickly.'

I smelled bullshit here but I wouldn't put it past the printer
companies in an effort to recoup their loss on the actual device to
ship with smaller, low capacity cartridges. Worse, the spectre of
Norma printing out several lengthy papers and articles and the ink
running out just as she printed of the final revision of her essay for
submission was hovering overhead like a hungry vulture.

'No thanks. No insurance. No additional ink. Just the printer. Thanks.'

I got home, quickly installed and configured the printer and
discovered HP provide two standard cartridges (black and the 3 colour
mix). No starter pack.

I quickly checked wireless printing from three Windows computers (XP,
Vista and Windows 7) and downloaded the latest version HP native Linux
software ([HPLIP][]) to configure and manage the printer which was
conveniently available in the Fedora 14 repositories.

Finally, I ordered two spare cartridges from Amazon for &pound;20
compared to &pound;24 at Comet.
