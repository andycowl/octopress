I have been pretty impressed with [Dreamhost](http://dreamhost.com/) so
far:

- Configured
  [putty](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/) for
  [SSH](http://www.phileplanet.com/archives/2006/08/how-to-setup-ssh-on-windows-xp/)
  access.
- Installed [Joomla](http://www.nbrightside.com/joomla/) (one-click)
- Upgraded to [PHP5](http://www.php.net/downloads.php#v5) (one-click)
- Installed
  [MediaWiki](http://www.nbrightside.com/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page)
  (one-click)
- Installed [Gregarius](http://www.nbrightside.com/gregarius/) (all by
  myself)

The only minor issues I have encountered is that I can't disable telnet
(insecure) and my analog stats didn't get refreshed today.

Dreamhost have a [blog](http://blog.dreamhost.com/), a
[Wiki](http://wiki.dreamhost.com/index.php/Main_Page), support
[forums](http://discussion.dreamhost.com/wwwthreads.pl) and any idiotic
questions (after ignoring all of those) have all been answered promptly
and courteously.
