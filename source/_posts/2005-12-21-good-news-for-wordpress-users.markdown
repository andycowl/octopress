The news is out.
[Yahoo!](http://smallbusiness.yahoo.com/webhosting/problogs.php?p=BALLOON)
will be offering WordPress hosted blogs for small businesses and
charging a monthly fee for the service.

I think this is good news for all WordPress users (.com and .org) as it
provides a revenue stream for future development.
