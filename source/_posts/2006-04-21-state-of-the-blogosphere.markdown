Web 2.0 aficionados, across the globe, held their collective breath
today as Mr. Norman Brightside, a little known and largely unsung
blogger, from Newcastle (near Norway) delivered his much awaited,
quarterly update to his renowned 'State of the Blogosphere' address.

Fresh from the successful launch of a [book
club](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/04/19/book-club/), Brightside
told an adoring and expectant audience:

> The blogosphere is in a right old state. There are a few more blogs
> appearing and the rate of growth is directly proportional to a
> fascinating new factor.
> Blogging growth = Technorati
> [apology](http://www.flickr.com/photos/70276096@N00/132028272/) growth
>
> For example, last month you might see the apology appear once a day.
> Now you see the apology twice a day. You can immediately conclude that
> the blogosphere has doubled in size during the period.
>
> And, err, that's it.
