Penny Coates is an overpaid idiot who thinks East Midlands Airport
should be [renamed](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/6220118.stm)
'East Midlands Airport - Nottingham, Leicester, Derby.'

Personally, I think 'Brian Clough Airport' would be better because
Cloughie is primarily associated with Nottingham, had links with Derby
and also occasionally enjoyed a curry and a few pints in Leicester.

Also, the proposed name will mean that most people will miss their
flights. By the time you've told the taxi driver your destination, the
plane will be on the runway.
