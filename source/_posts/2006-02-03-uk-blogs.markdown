I wanted to find UK related blogs written by people in the UK as most
blog indexes and search engines naturally tend to be heavily weighted
towards the US.

Initially, I searched on [Technorati](http://technorati.com/) for 'UK'
tags. However, this included lots of photo blogs from tourists visiting
London on whale watching holidays and UK 'political' news (yawn).

Then I came across [britblog.com](http://www.britblog.com/) which is an
growing index of UK based blogs which includes blogs listed by region
and category in addition to recently added and popular blogs.

Britblog also has an interesting
[map](http://www.britblog.com/directory/map.php) displaying the
distribution of blogs across the UK.
