On the return flight from Newcastle to Heathrow, I was sitting behind a
family who were lucky enough to be going to Sydney, Australia for a
holiday. I was immediately behind two young lads (8 and 6). Obviously
both were very excited at flying for the first time.

They were excited when we pushed back, they were nervous when we
accelerated down the runway and they were delirious when we left the
ground.

The lads were absolutely amazed when they could see the houses, rivers,
mountains, railway tracks and motorways from 20,000 feet. Forty five
minutes later, as we descended below the cloud base, the two boys took
in the sights of London. The excitement of the youngest lad now reached
fever pitch.
> 'Look Paul, Big Ben. Paul. Look there is Big Ben'

I glanced across. I couldn't see Big Ben but I could see a church in
Richmond.

> 'DAD LOOK THERE IS WEMBLEY STADIUM. LOOK DAD ! WEMBLEY STADIUM'

I glanced across. I couldn't see Wembley Stadium but I could see
Twickenham. Gear down. Airport complex in sight.

> ** 'MUM, DAD, PAUL. LOOK ! LOOK ! THERE IS SYDNEY OPERA HOUSE. SYDNEY
> OPERA HOUSE. LOOK !' **

I glanced across. The little boy was right. Off to the right - Sydney
Opera House.
