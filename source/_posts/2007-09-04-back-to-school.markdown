When my daughter went to secondary school, like every other dutiful
parent, we religiously completed all the necessary forms and paperwork.

As part of this, I must have divulged my mobile phone number. Now this
must have been intended for emergency use only because I don't divulge
my mobile number (07723 431768) lightly.

So, imagine my surprise when I received the following text message
yesterday:
> 'This is Hogwarts Girls' School. This is a reminder that Autumn Term
> starts on Wednesday 5th September at 8:40am. Hope you had a good
> summer. Thank you.'

I was gratified to see the correct positioning of the apostrophe and
replied:

> 'Many thanks for your recent text message. I was so busy enjoying my
> summer holidays that I had completely forgotten the fact I attended
> school so your reminder was very timely. I am sure my mum probably
> would have reminded me at some point because she is so annoying like
> that.
> Rest assured I have purchased a brand new compass and protractor set
> for the challenges in the coming year. However, thus far, I have
