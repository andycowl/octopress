Dear Cathy & Claire

'I have just started going out with a boy much older than me...'

No - sorry. I have just started blogging and find myself increasingly
worrying about blogging etiquette. For example, I just read an
interesting article about Oracle by Jeff Moss and wrote a followup on
my blog. I felt my article was too long to be posted as a comment on
Jeff's blog.

So what do I do ? I want to acknowledge Jeff's original article. Do I
post a comment on Jeff's blog saying 'Nice article Jeff. This inspired
me to write my own followup here' (with a link to my blog).

Or would that be considered rude and close to spam or trawling for
traffic by the blogging community ?

Should my thoughts truly been a lengthy comment on Jeff's blog ?

Also, people occasionally comment on my blog but don't leave an email
address so I am unable to followup directly with the
individual. Again, I don't think it merits a comment from me on my own
blog to say 'Thanks for popping by. I found your blog on the Palm PDA
very useful'.

Alternatively, if I visit their blog and add a comment, it would be
totally out of context.

Thanks for any advice

Norman
