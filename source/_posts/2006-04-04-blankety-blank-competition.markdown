Lee Trundle's smile after Swansea's victory (in the Sunday Pub League
Final played at, of all places, Cardiff) couldn't be any wider without
fracturing his jaw. But what I love about this
[story](http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/s/swansea_city/4871362.stm)
most is the following statement by Swansea FC's chairman, Huw Jenkins:
> 'Maybe it was a heat-of-the-moment thing'

Possibly, but given Lee Trundle had gone to the trouble of getting a
T-shirt printed with a cartoon depicting a person urinating over a
Cardiff shirt, that seems a little unlikely.
