I had a blind date this morning at 06.55. An early start admittedly but
this lady would surely be worth it. The lady's name was Iris. I was
supposed to meet her in Terminal 1 at London Heathrow.

Iris was flying in from Russia after a short courtship (19 hours) on the
Internet. I even had an letter (IM) from Iris. Iris said she'd be
waiting on the right before you reach the shops (which was worrying
enough in itself).

So I slept downstairs on the sofa, snatched some sleep and I booked the
[taxi](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/04/03/rude-awakening/) 30
minutes earlier than normal.

But, of course, Iris was nowhere to be seen. Stood up once again. Why.
oh why, didn't Iris show up ? What's wrong with me ? Will I ever find
true love ? I am disconsolate. I am a broken man.

Turns out that [Iris](http://iris.gov.uk/) only wants to date high
flying, big earning, international travellers with BA Silver (or above)
and isn't interested in peasants in flying to Newcastle. Even if they
are staying in the
[Malmaison](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/03/27/a-cause-for-concern/).
