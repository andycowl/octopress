I was seriously considering selling all my stock options and
purchasing a 1GB USB memory [stick][] for an amazing 30 GBP.

Then I thought I would get an account at [box.net][] and upload all
the precious files, that my wife sadly lost when my hard disk died a
couple of years ago, there instead. This has the advantages that if I
ever need to take my memory stick to Seattle to show Auntie Rita, this
will be possible, I won’t be able to leave the memory stick in a
client’s PC in Eastern Europe and, finally, it will cost me 30 GBP
less.

I haven’t used the box.net service much but there is a nice
drag’n’drop interface for uploading folders and multiple files and it
seems intuitive and quick. There is a free 1GB service available and
you pay for additional storage which seems fair enough.

If you are interested in trying out the box.net service, then please,
please click [HERE!][] (so I can upgrade to the Deluxe, Premium, Gold
512GB service free of charge) as all the worst Web sites (used to)
say.
