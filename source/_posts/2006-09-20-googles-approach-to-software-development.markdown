[Rakesh Agrawal](http://rake.sh/blog/) presents an interesting
[summary](http://rake.sh/blog/2006/09/14/the-road-to-google-calendar/)
of a talk by Carl Sjogreen describing Google's approach to the software
development process.

-   Google [Calendar](http://calendar.google.com/) was a relatively
    small project (3 engineers, 1 product manager).
-   Google talk to real users ('Grandma in NYC') not techy geeks to find
    what users really want.
-   Google 'eat their own dog food'. Lots of internal testing prior to
    public launch.
-   Gap in the market. Lots of calendar products out there but none do
    what people want. Typical Google opportunity.
-   Paper based calendars are the real competition.
