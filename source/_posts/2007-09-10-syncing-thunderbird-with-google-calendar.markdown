Just installed the
[Lightning](http://www.mozilla.org/projects/calendar/lightning/)
extension which provides an embedded calendar
([Sunbird](http://www.mozilla.org/projects/calendar/sunbird/)) within
Thunderbird.

This is made even more useful by the addition of the [Provider for
Google
Calendar](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/addon/4631)
add-on that enables seamless, two way synchronisation between Google
Calendar and Thunderbird.
