I am jet-lagged because a customer asked me to fly, at short notice,
from Newcastle to Belfast at 07:05 on Wednesday morning.

I had a suspicion this was important because when I told the client that
my flights between London and Newcastle were non-refundable he replied
'I don't care about that. Just get on a plane to Belfast.'

Initially, I was harbouring hopes of watching Newcastle play Stoke City
in a Cup Replay on Wednesday evening and I was about to politely enquire
about the possibility of departing early on Thursday morning when the
project manager added: 'Oh and take anything you might need to install
Siebel and clone our existing environment on to brand new, standalone
infrastructure.'

My normal concerns about oversleeping were accentuated by the fact I was
booked for my first ever flight on EasyJet. I was worried about no
e-ticket, additional charges for a seat, additional charges for checking
my bag into the hold, additional charges for an overpriced cheese and
bacon panini. I was terrified about lengthy queues of people going to
Florida and the Alps for &pound;24.99 (+ &pound;110 tax and fuel surcharge) blocking
my path to the single check-in desk.

So, I duly went to bed at 20:30 and set my alarm for 04:45 to allow a
full half hour to get dressed, double check my passport and Siebel
DVD's, find the night porter, check out of the hotel and impatiently
wait for my taxi (booked for 05:15).

However, recurring nightmares about being 16 seconds late for the
check-in desk and featuring on 'Airline' woke me at 04:12 precisely. I
also dreamt of Tony Robinson filming my arrival, flustered and stressed,
at the bright orange check-in desk at 06:26.

Holiday makers with young children and lads going to Prague for a stag
week are tutting behind me as I plead:
