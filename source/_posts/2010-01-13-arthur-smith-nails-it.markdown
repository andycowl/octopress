As this country grinds to a halt yet again after a light dusting of
snow, a timely and apt quote from Arthur Smith whose autobiography
'[My Name is Daphne
Fairfax](http://www.amazon.co.uk/My-Name-Daphne-Fairfax-Memoir/dp/0091921031/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1263376748&sr=8-1)'
I can highly recommend.
