Q: Who on earth could manage to screw up a Cup draw involving just four
teams ?

A: The [Scottish
FA](http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/scot_cups/7072638.stm).

Reminds me of a funny Not The Nine O'Clock News sketch where the draw is
made for the FA Cup Final.

> 'Number 2 - Arsenal ...will play
>
> Number 1 - Liverpool
> and that completes the draw for the FA Cup Final. '
