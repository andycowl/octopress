I am a fan of WordPress. I like their software. I like their
[humour](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/03/12/wordpress-humour/).

I pay absolutely nothing for the service so I really can't complain when
it breaks.

However, today is the second day I can't access my blog on WordPress.

Nothing on [Technorati](http://technorati.com/). Nothing on
[Digg](http://digg.com/). Nothing on
[tech.memeorandum](http://tech.memeorandum.com/). Nothing on
[TailRank](http://tailrank.com/). Nothing from those Wordpress 'A'
listers, [Scoble](http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/) and
[Winer](http://scripting.wordpress.com/).

In fact, as I could see other people sporadically
[blogging](http://lorelle.wordpress.com/2006/03/13/probloggers-blogging-for-beginners-series/)
on WordPress, my paranoia took hold and I started to wonder whether I
was the only person in the entire blogosphere affected by this problem.

Then, finally, I read the following
[posting](http://wordpress.com/forums/topic.php?id=1029&replies=6) from
[Matt Mullenweg](http://photomatt.net/) in the WordPress Support forum

> We're shifting some things to address the problem, and there is new

So, that's fine. An update from someone in the know although the phrase
'new hardware...when we can get it' makes me slightly uncomfortable and
reaching for my Blogger details and the non-existent WordPress 'export'
button.

Anyway, I am sure that when a spate of other high profile Web 2.0
companies
([del.icio.us](http://blog.del.icio.us/blog/2005/12/index.html),
[Blogger](http://buzz.blogger.com/2005/12/blogspot-is-happy-again.html),
[TypePad](http://www.sixapart.com/typepad/news/2005/12/recap_of_friday_1.html))
had problems in December last year, the news was plastered all over
Technorati and elsewhere.

So, are WordPress so fantastic and so powerful, that they are actually
beyond reproach ?
