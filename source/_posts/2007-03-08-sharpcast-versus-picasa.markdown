Curiously, after reading about the Picasa
[upgrade](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/03/08/picasa-web-albums-upgraded-to-1gb/),
a related article about photo management software popped up in Google
[Reader](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/02/18/resisting-the-lure-of-google-reader/),
courtesy of Robert [Scoble](http://scobleizer.com/)'s excellent
[link blog](http://www.google.com/reader/shared/14480565058256660224).

Robert Scoble had published a couple of podcasts featuring a product
[demo](http://www.podtech.net/home/technology/2313/sharpcast-demo-brings-simple-way-to-manage-photos)
and an
[interview](http://www.podtech.net/home/technology/2312/talking-about-web-20-photo-and-file-sync)
with Gibu Thomas, CEO of [Sharpcast](https://www.sharpcast.com/).
Sharpcast is yet another photo management software tool and appears to
offer a number of advantages over [Picasa](http://picasa.google.com/):

-   Unlimited free storage
-   Automatic synchronisation between PC and Web albums
-   Original images are preserved

The unlimited storage seems too good to be true and is very useful
because, at some point in the near future, I am likely to exceed
Picasa's storage limit unless Google follow suit.
Secondly, if I ever edit an image or perform any housekeeping, I will
have to manually replicate those changes to Picasa Web Albums. As I am
very
[lazy](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/01/27/unix-for-lazy-people/),
that is unlikely to happen.

Finally, I have always presumed that Flickr and Picasa are compressing
the images to degrade the quality of my professional photographs to save
space and bandwidth. However, that is fine as you get what you pay for
and I am paying nothing. Obviously, it is preferable to have the
original, unmodified image available without having to continually burn
another CD/DVD.

So I signed up for Sharpcast, downloaded the desktop software and
quickly synchronised the 'My Pictures' folder to the server.

Sharpcast was very fast and easy to use. I was able to synchronise and
upload 1,062 photos with a single click. This took less time than
uploading the same content from Picasa. Although you can upload multiple
albums in Picasa, one album is uploaded at at time and the remainder are
queued.

Sharpcast is a genuine competitor to Flickr and Picasa and in the
podcast, Gibu talks about extending the range of files to include
documents. Sharpcast also includes support for Mac users and mobile
phones.

My only reservation is that Sharpcast really does seem too good to be
true. I am also a little hazy about the business model. It is not clear
if this is Web 2.0 beta software which will subsequently charge or
whether Sharpcast will attempt to make money from additional services.
Currently the only paid service is photo printing.
