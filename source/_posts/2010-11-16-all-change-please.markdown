This blog is now running on Drupal 7 (beta 3).

Currently Disqus comments are absent but I am hoping the Global
Redirect module and the Disqus crawler will remedy this given time.

Most of the modules I require are available for Drupal 7 apart from
FeedBurner so I have just re-pointed the feed for now.

Let's see if this appears on the other side.

I will probably convert to using MarkDown markup in due course too.

Main reason for ditching Habari was the lack of user forums.
