Some principled bloggers leave all comments untouched afraid that any
subsequent edit (no matter how seemingly trivial) would represent the
slippery slope to censorship, a police state, the inevitable involvement
of Amnesty International and charity gigs by U2.

Apart from a single comment by a member of the BNP, I have never had
this problem until now.

> A new comment on the post \#45 "music for a (very) long car journey"
> \> Mate, you're a dick
> A new comment on the post \#485 "flowery twats" 
> \> Mate, it was obviously you're fault you twat.

However, I chose to delete these comments because:

1.  I dislike such profanity.
2.  The twat didn't even get the joke in 'flowery twats'.
3.  Misuse of "you're" in \#2.
