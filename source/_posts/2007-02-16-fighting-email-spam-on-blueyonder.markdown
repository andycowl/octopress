In recent weeks, I have been peppered with increasing amounts of spam to
my Blueyonder account despite the fact that I rarely use or divulge this
email address.

I guess I have become spoiled by [Akismet](http://akismet.com/) and
[Gmail](http://mail.google.com/mail/) which both do such a sterling job
of automatically detecting spam.

Anyway, it turns out Blueyonder do have a spam filtering capability. If
you log onto Webmail, under Options, there is a section called
'Anti-spam and Antivirus Preferences'.

Make sure the 'Enable Spam Checking' box is checked. You can alter the
default spam sensitivity to be 'High' and set the option to tag the
email subject with [SPAM].

Then you can create a message filter in Outlook Express or Thunderbird
to automatically dump such messages to a separate folder for periodic
review.
