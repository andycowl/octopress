Well I was finally forced to join the masses and download
[Firefox](http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/) and ditch Internet
Explorer.  Yes - my nickname is 'Johnny Come Lately'.

I had been aware of the Firefox browser for a while but my previous
experience was with a very early version of Mozilla that had a few
problems with a couple of the Web sites I was using at the time.

The final straw came that pushed me over the edge was when my children
downloaded some invasive spyware that commandeered the Web browser and
implanted a 'Web Search' toolbar. As you can not deconfigure this
toolbar without completely removing the product, I found myself
uninstalling it, my kids would reinstall it for some whizzy colourful
cursors. Repeat ad infinitum. Life is simply too short.

The immediate benefit of Firefox is the tabbed browsing which lets you
keep multiple Web sites open and visible at the same time. After you
have used this feature for a while, it is indispensible and you wonder
how you ever lived without it.

Then I experimented with RSS feeds from the BBC and elsewhere. Instead
of having to periodically check a range of Web sites for any new
content, I wanted automatic notification of when new content was
available. However, while the 'Live bookmarks' feature in Firefox was
pretty good, I really wanted something like a pseudo newsgroup that
would list new articles on a Website just like articles in a newsgroup.
So, I downloaded [Thunderbird](http://www.mozilla.com/thunderbird/)
which seamlessly and painlessly converted all my email messages and
contacts from Outlook Express and I was finished.

I have been using Firefox for a week now and so far, the only Web sites
that I have encountered problems with is Sony's SonicStage download page
(which insists on Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.0) and Blueyonder's
selfcare home page (which is gloriously blank). However, this probably
says more about the authors of these Web sites rather than any
deficiencies in Firefox.
