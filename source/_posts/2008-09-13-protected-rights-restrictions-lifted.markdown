I have written before about the
[consolidation](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2005/11/21/my-personal-pensions-crisis/)
of my various pension pots into a self-invested pension plan (SIPP).

One slight
[irritation](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/09/19/staggering-incompetence/)
was that the Protected Rights elements could not be transferred so I was
forced to hold these funds in a stakeholder pension.

However, today I received an email from
[Sippdeal](http://www.sippdeal.co.uk/) stating that the Government is
[lifting](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/5ef147b2-706b-11dd-b514-0000779fd18c.html)
these restrictions and that, from October 1, protected rights
contributions can be transferred into my SIPP.
