Frankly I think the pair deserve each other but some excellent
[quotes][] from Tevez's agent, Kia Joorabchian, on Garry Cock.

> ‘Garry Cock thinks he's bigger than Carlos Tevez.'
>
> ‘Garry Cock has an inflated opinion of himself. I brought him in from
> Nike after he begged me to get him a job in football.'
>
> ‘I got him a job which paid him more than four times what he was
> earning at Nike and he didn't complain about me then but it's all gone
> to his head.'
>
> ‘Maybe because he played no part in bringing Carlos to the club that's
> a problem for him. Maybe he's upset because he didn't have any input.'
