On Saturday night, BBC2 broadcast a
[retrospective](http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/comedy/2009/08/ricky-gervais-a-night-at-the-office.shtml)
on 'The Office' and broadcast all of Series 1 together with soundbites
from the creators (Ricky Gervais, Stephen Merchant), the cast (Martin
Freeman, Mackenzie Crook, Lucy Davis) and celebrity fans (Ben Stiller,
Christopher Guest, Matthew Perry, David Baddiel, Richard Curtis).

My favourite episode of Series 1 is 'Staff Training' for all the normal
reasons and for this rendition of 'Free love on the free love freeway' -
I just love the harmonising from Gareth at 1:24 ('She's not dead').
