British Airways, shocked at missing out last year's
[trophy](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/01/18/probably-the-best-marketing-campaign-ever/),
have launched a superlative campaign for 2008.

Agency: Itchy & Scraatchi. Cost: &pound;25,000 found in a digger after the
completion of T5. Gate 3 - Newcastle airport.

> Together we can work wonders

Off to a gentle modest start.
> Together we can get people talking about T5

That is certainly true.
> Together we can make T5 world famous

Some wag has added a prefix of 'in'.
> Together we can keep people smiling

Most people smile, dumped in Vancouver 17 hours late with no clean
shirts and underpants, don't they ?
> Together we can keep things moving

Well most things with the exception of the baggage carousels.

...and the final, closing, crowning glory.
> Together we can get off to a flying start

Honestly, if you made it up, people wouldn't believe you.
