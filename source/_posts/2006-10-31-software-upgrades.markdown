[Drupal](http://www.nbrightside.com/drupal/) gets an upgrade to 4.7.4
via the Bluehost Fantastico auto-installer.

The [Wiki](http://www.nbrightside.com/wiki/) gets converted to
[MediaWiki](http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki) simply because it
is a lot easier on the eye. This software requires PHP5 and I was
originally on a server running PHP4. However I read that Bluehost does
also support PHP5. I just asked politely and got moved to a different
server. No fuss. No questions. Technical support just did it. Quickly
and efficiently.

Of course, neither package is currently used but that's beside the
point.

DreamHost
[upgraded](http://www.dreamhoststatus.com/2006/10/30/wordpress-one-click-install-updated-to-version-205/)
to the recently released WordPress
[2.0.5](http://wordpress.org/development/2006/10/205-ronan/) almost
immediately. I think I prefer Bluehost's strategy of waiting a while for
any creases to be ironed out before upgrading.
