I received a summons yesterday for non-payment of council tax. Ah well.
It was good while it lasted. I reckon at &pound;1,000 each year for 10 years
residence at this address, I probably saved in excess of &pound;10,000.

Still, all good things must come to an end. What a pity those rotters at
the council caught up with me.

Then I realised - I already pay my council tax automatically by direct
debit to fund the firemen, refuse collectors, recycling collections, the
lengthy queues at the tip on a Sunday morning, the multitude of speed
bumps and liquid lunches for the fine councillors of this parish.

I read the letter more carefully and then I remembered. This demand for
council tax was for a property in Dover. I do not own a property in
Dover. I do not want to own a property in Dover. In addition, the named
person on the summons was not actually me.

Then I remembered. I had already received an initial bill from Dover
City Council which I ignored followed by a red letter which I
'annotated' and returned to sender. Finally, I received a final demand
from Dover City Council so I had to write yet another letter explaining
the situation.

At this point, Norma started to worry that I might be sent to prison
(and be molested in the showers by hard-core criminals) so now I was
forced to call Dover City Council on the telephone to explain the
situation to a human being.

I was assured by a helpful lady with a funny accent that they would
update their records accordingly and she even apologised for the
inconvenience and upset caused. Then she passed me onto 'Debt Recovery'
where a menacing, softly spoken gentleman demanded to know if I knew
where 'Andrew Henderson' actually lived.

This communication ended the whole administrative nightmare and I forgot
about it until the summons arrived yesterday.

Now Norma is locked in the house armed with a shotgun, living in fear of
the baliffs arriving to seize goods to the values of &pound;548.21. I told her
my United programs were absolutely sacrosanct and maybe consider wearing
a short skirt, a wide smile and negotiate 'payment in kind'. This
strategy worked very well with the driving examiner.

However, I suspect when I return home, I will discover that she will
have buried all our valuables (both of them) in the garden and deposited
all our money (&pound;17.89 and some dollars) in the loft.

I only hope she doesn't shoot the window cleaner who calls every other
Thursday.
