I have experimented with many different RSS
[readers](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2005/12/13/comparison-of-rss-readers/)
in the past. However, in recent months, nothing has managed to dislodge
[NetVibes](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/05/25/good-vibes-from-netvibes/)
as my preferred feed reader.

However, I still occasionally use Google
[Reader](http://reader.google.com/) and like the recent
[addition](http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2007/01/i-like-big-charts-and-i-cannot-lie.html)
of detailed statistics about your RSS subscriptions and reading habits.

Matt Cutts posts an
[example](http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/new-reader-trends-page/) of his
own data and Robert Scoble also
[likes](http://scobleizer.com/2007/01/03/25000-items-read-on-google-reader/)
the new features.
