Many disgruntled readers have contacted me via email, IM, facsimilie,
phone and anonymous posion pen letters to ask 'Hey Norman - whatever
happened to the unified blogging day scheduled for Friday 18 April ?'

Apologies for the delay but before we get started, some random,
meaningless statistics:

-   Feedburner: 66 subscribers.
-   Google Reader : 'From your 189 subscriptions, over the last 30 days
    you read 6,807 items, starred 1 items,
    [shared](https://www.google.com/reader/shared/08375973873450584543)
    325 items'.
-   Twitter: Following 19. Followers 55. Updates 1,292 in 87 days.
-   FriendFeed: Subscribed to 35. Subscribed to me: 30.
    [Comments](http://friendfeed.com/andyc/comments): 180 this week, 504
    all time. [Likes](http://friendfeed.com/andyc/likes): 77 this week,
    188 all time.
-   Disqus: Comments left: 59 in 21 days. Comments on my blog: 31 in 14
    days. Precious clout points - 12.

Originally, on Unified Blogging Day, I was going to religiously
transcribe every single 'output' over a 24 hour period into a separate
blog entry (annotated with timestamp and channel).

This was primarily a final effort to alienate loyal (but shell-shocked)
readers who had survived the WordPress to Habari migration.

However, thankfully, [FriendFeed](http://friendfeed.com/) already
aggregates that inane stream of consciousness beautifully formatted
[here](http://friendfeed.com/andyc).

A secondary aim of Unified Blogging Day was to conduct a detailed poll
to see how people subscribe to each 'output' but Habari doesn't have a
'Poll' plugin so just leave a comment below indicating which channel(s)
you are a) aware of, b) subscribe to c) devour feverishly and d)
blissfully unaware of.
-   [Blog](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/) - a man barely alive but we
    have the technology to rebuild him.
-   [Tumblr](http://andyc.tumblr.com/) - stuff I'm too embarassed to put
    on the blog.
-   Technical [blog](http://www.nbrightside.com/drupal/) - low traffic.
-   [Twitter](http://twitter.com/andycowl) - endless stream of drivel
    (soon to be upgraded to include 'Hello', Goodnight' and the state of
    my runny nose).
-   [Disqus](http://disqus.com/people/andycowl/) - every single comment
    I have left on the blogoshpere (on Disqus enabled blogs).
-   [FriendFeed](http://friendfeed.com/andyc) - unified feed of all of
    the above. Filters available to reduce the signal/noise ratio.

Anyone owning up to subscribing to duplicate channels will have stay
behind after school for 1 hours detention (unless they have a note from
Mummy).
