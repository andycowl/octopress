Dear Red Lorry

You are a similar size to yellow lorry. You are a similar weight to
yellow lorry. You have a similar size engine to yellow lorry.

When yellow lorry slows down going up an incline, the laws of physics
mean that you are also likely to slow down. Consequently, there is
little point attempting to overtake yellow lorry. Unless you shed your
trailer or engage turbo boost mode, you will simply hog the middle lane.
You may eventually pass yellow lorry on the flat after 17 minutes and
9.4 miles. Alternatively, you may have to abort the manoeuvre and lose
face.

So please just sit behind yellow lorry and unwrap another man-size
Yorkie.

Yours sincerely

Motor car
