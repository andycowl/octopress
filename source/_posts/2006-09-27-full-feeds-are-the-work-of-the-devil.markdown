When you turn to the light and start to fully embrace the
[River of News](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/09/21/drowning-in-a-river-of-news/),
the sickening realisation slowly dawns that you might actually have been
[mistaken](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/05/26/partial-versus-full-fe/)
and partial feeds may just have some redeeming features while full feeds
are indeed the work of the devil.

Full feeds potentially interrupt the flow of the river. The title alone
isn't enough to determine whether the article merits further
consideration. Expanding the article should give you just enough to
determine whether you want to read the full text.

This effect is spoiled by the lengthy verbosity of the full text feed
for articles you are not interested in whatsoever.

The ideal compromise would be a 2 line precis of the article but
[Peter Scott](http://pjsrandom.wordpress.com/)
is the only blogger in the universe who is
[thoughtful](http://pjsrandom.wordpress.com/2006/08/14/things-that-annoy/)
enough to do this.
