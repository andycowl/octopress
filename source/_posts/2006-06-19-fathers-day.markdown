Someone in my family was lucky enough to receive a Sony
[PSP](http://www.yourpsp.com/) over the weekend. The Sony PSP is a fun
device. The PSP can play music. The PSP can surf the Internet. The PSP
can even view photos and DVD's. The PSP is also pretty good as a games
console apparently.

The PSP is attractively styled in black although, bizarrely, my model
came with a hideous white strap and incongruous white earphones.

I connected the PSP to my wireless network and to my amazement, it
worked first time so I was able to upgrade the PSP software using
'Network Update'.

However, Web browsing is tortuous as entering text is pretty slow but
the quality of the display is excellent.

Oh and the lucky person wasn't me.
