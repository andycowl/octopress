A kind lady called Sarah encountered my blog, was horrified by what
she saw, and and proffered this
[suggestion](http://sarahk.pcpropertymanager.com/blog/essential-change-to-blogger-templates/163)
for tweaking the standard blogger template to add the readability of
long articles by adding the heading to the footer section.

Eventually, I managed to successfully apply the changes (she left a
spurious space character to ensure you have a little work to do) so I
hope you enjoy the changes as much as I do.
