1. Describing your state of mind. I really don't care whether you are
happy, sad, somewhere inbetween or suicidal because your girlfriend
dumped you.

2. Describing your state of health. I really don't want to read about
your flu like symptoms, your hangover, your runny nose or your
migraine headache. Otherwise you will give me one.

3. Telling me what music you are listening to. You like your music. I
like my music. We may share some common interests but it really
doesn't matter.

4. Playing me your music. It is more likely that we won't share
musical tastes so please don't force your music onto me. Particularly,
if it is your own work with your mates.

5. Crazy, colourful Flash animations. I may have a headache too. This
may make it worse.

6. Dull, boring tedious lists of (del.icio.us) links. At least,
annotate them with why they are interesting to you.

7. Pleading and begging for 'Comments' by asking a question at the end
of the article. For example, 'So what you all think about Google
Operating System ?' or 'So what 4 blogging tools would you pack up and
take to a desert island ?'.
