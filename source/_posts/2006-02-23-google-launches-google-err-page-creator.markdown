Important message to all you bloggers contemplating a migration to
WordPress.com.

Google has just launched Google [Pages](http://pages.google.com/) - a
Web site builder with lots of 'Looks' and 'Layouts' available to choose
from and a nice, friendly easy to use WYSIWYG interface.

Like all Web 2.0 applications, it is still a beta version.

However, this seems an odd product to launch in 2006. As Mark E. Smith
once said 'Are you still doing what you did 5 years ago - Yeah ? Well -
don't make a career out of it'.

Here is my [effort](http://andycowl.googlepages.com/home) to show you
what is possible with minimal effort and no knowledge of HTML
whatsoever.

If you like my style, I am available at evenings and weekend for
commissions.
