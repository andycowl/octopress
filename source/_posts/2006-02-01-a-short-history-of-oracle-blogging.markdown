I was just reviewing the list of Oracle related blogs I subscribe to.
Here they are in approximate chronological order with the blogging
platform. Apologies for any inaccuracies.

    Blogger

A couple of things struck me...

-   Mark Rittman was one of the first Oracle bloggers (if not the first)
    and uses the Movable Type platform. Not one Oracle blogger has
    chosen to follow suit (ever). I wonder why.
-   Most Oracle bloggers use blogger.com which is a hosted platform but
    most are not afraid to tweak their templates with varying degrees of
    success. Think garish colours, think 'Changing Rooms'.
-   The birth of Tom Kyte's blog seemed to inspire a lot of Oracle
    bloggers to follow suit.

Anyway, thanks to all of you for the information, the technical content,
the thoughts, the ramblings and perhaps most importantly, the humour.
