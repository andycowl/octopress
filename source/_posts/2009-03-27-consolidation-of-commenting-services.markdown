Since I [started](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2005/08/17/dot-bombs/) this
blog, I have maintained an interest in various blog commenting services.
Back in November 2007, I experimented with
[SezWho](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/11/16/sezwho-comment-ratings-system/)
and also
[reviewed](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/11/20/comparison-of-cocomment-cocomments-and-commentful/)
three more similar comment tracking services before finally settling on
[Disqus](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2008/04/09/25-reasons-you-should-use-disqus/).

Competition is obviously a good thing but this is proving a tough
climate for small, Web 2.0 companies competing in a small, overcrowded
marketplace and we have recently seen some consolidation in this area.

-   [SezWho](http://sezwho.com/) - Unfortunately, SezWho
    [ceased](http://blog.sezwho.com/blog/2009/03/05/sezwho-js-kit/)
    trading yesterday with a recommended upgrade path to JS-Kit.
-   [Disqus](http://disqus.com/) - still going strong with recent
    [announcement](http://blog.disqus.net/2009/03/26/upgraded-interface-and-performance/)
    of improvements to performance and UI.
-   [coComment](http://www.cocomment.com/) - still going albeit with a
    horrendous interface.
-   [co.mments](http://co.mments.com/) - consigned to the dead pool.
-   [commentful](http://commentful.blogflux.com/) - still alive. For
    now.

The two main commenting services that appear to represent serious
competition for Disqus are [IntenseDebate](http://intensedebate.com/)
and [JS-Kit](http://js-kit.com/) although I have no personal experience
of either product. Anyone out there used them ?
