In the last week of the great Australian adventure, we took a guided
tour from Kununurra to Broome, in a 4x4 truck, visiting Purnululu
National Park and the Bungle Bungles.

The scenery was fantastic, the company was great and our guide was
interesting, professional, humorous and knowledgeable.

One day, we also took another boat trip and a bushwalk at Fitzroy
Crossing with an Aboriginal guide.

The Aboriginal guide was fascinating. He talked about Aboriginal
culture, the importance of Dreamtime, respect for the environment,
respect for each other, how Aboriginals lived off the land for 40,000
years, the extended kinship model, the need to take just what you want
and not what you need. In fact, there are so many areas we could learn
from the Aboriginal culture.

At night, we were able to gaze up into a beautiful, dark, crystal clear
sky. I was amazed to be able to clearly see the Milky Way, Venus and
identify various constellations in the night sky. Then one of my new
found Aussie friends broke the silence with a statement that staggered
me and made me pause for thought:

> 'Of course, the Aborigines don't look at the stars. They look at the
> spaces between the stars.'
