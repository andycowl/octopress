I decided to save Oracle Corporation lots of money by not attending
Oracle Open World in San Francisco. Initially, my manager spent a lot of
time trying to dissuade me but as soon as he uttered the words 'Billy
Joel' and 'Prince', I immediately volunteered for some billable work in
Sunderland to help pay for Doug's complimentary red sleeping
[bags](http://oracledoug.com/blog/index.php?/archives/1327-A-New-Comfy-Seat-for-The-Boys-and-Polly-....html).

Doug
[Burns](http://oracledoug.com/serendipity/index.php?/archives/1342-yaaisfb.html),
Tim
[Hall](http://www.oracle-base.com/blog/2007/11/12/openworld-arrival-and-day-1/)
and John
[Scott](http://jes.blogs.shellprompt.net/2007/11/11/gotta-love-jetlag/)
seem to have a real problem conquering jet lag while Mark
[Rittman](http://www.rittmanmead.com/2007/11/12/first-days-at-oracle-open-world-2007/)
just does 'the British thing and goes down the pub'. While I don't
travel to the States that often, I did attend a Microsoft training
[course](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/05/02/further-afield/) in
Seattle last year. As I don't sleep on planes, I do recall being quite
tired when we disembarked and slightly annoyed when my colleague
volunteered to navigate and let me concentrate on driving.

However, after checking into the
[hotel](http://www.starwoodhotels.com/whotels/property/overview/index.html?propertyID=1154),
having a walk around the lovely harbour and getting something to eat, I
remember feeling pretty good. In fact, after a couple of drinks, I was
ready put my Amex card behind the bar but my colleague insisted on
dragging me back to my bedroom screaming 'But we must go to bed at
22:09'

Anyway to OOW; Oracle Apps Lab
[launched](http://oracleappslab.com/2007/11/11/mix-is-live/) Oracle
[Mix](https://mix.oracle.com/) which is a version of an internal Oracle
networking site (which I am ashamed to admit I only discovered recently)
and there is a short
[discussion](http://blogs.oracle.com/otn/2007/11/12#a1132) about
Oracle's gradual adoption of such networking and community tools. I must
say I preferred the name 'Connect' to 'Mix' but still, if anyone wants
to link up, you know where to find me.

Andrew Clarke has a typically British and impartial
[review](http://radiofreetooting.blogspot.com/2007/11/oow2k7-whats-story.html)
on Larry Ellison's opening keynote while Eddie Awad has recorded some
fun micro-[interviews](http://awads.net/wp/tag/openworld07/) with Oracle
staff and bloggers alike. Interesting to put a face and voice to people
I only know from their Internet presence.

The other announcement thus far of note is [Oracle
VM](http://www.oracle.com/technologies/virtualization/index.html).
Virtualisation is a strong growth area (I meet lots of Siebel customers
deploying or planning to use VM) and this is an obvious market for
Oracle to enter to complement [Enterprise
Linux](http://www.oracle.com/technologies/linux/index.html).
