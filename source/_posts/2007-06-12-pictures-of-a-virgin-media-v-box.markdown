Lots of people stumble onto this blog hoping to find technical
information, reviews and images of a black Virgin Media V+ set top box.

I presume this is either husbands trying to convince the wife that the
box will comply with the aesthetics in the lounge or geeks trying to
look at all those connectors on the back.

Whoever you are, whatever you are, these
[pictures](http://picasaweb.google.com/nbrightside/VirginMediaVBox) are
for all you people out there.
