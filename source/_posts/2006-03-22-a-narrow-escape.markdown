I was just quietly unloading the dishwasher this morning, when my 10
year old daughter enters the kitchen and screams:
> 'HE'S DEAD, DAD, HE'S DEAD. LOOK DAD. HE'S DEAD !'

Sure enough, Chewy, the 18 month old gerbil had got himself wedged in a
Xmas wrapping paper tube. Being slightly narrower than a toilet roll,
the poor thing had wedged himself in and was absolutely motionless with
his bottom sticking out of one end.

As I have never held the filthy rodent alive let alone dead, I summoned
my wife, Norma, from the shower. Well, she is a trained Intensive Care
Nurse after all. As Norma went to cut away the cardboard to free Chewy
and prepare him for cremation, we suddenly saw frantic motion.

Thank God, against all the odds, the poor creature is still alive:

> 'HE'S ALIVE DAD, HE'S ALIVE. LOOK, DAD. HE'S ALIVE !'

Unfortunately the little gerbil was so frightened, he started thrashing
around uncontrollably like a rodent that had been helplessly trapped for
8 hours unable to see or move.

Consequently Norma inadvertently dropped him into the laundry basket and
spontaneously urinated onto my underpants and socks (Chewy that is, not
Norma).

This comedy of errors continued as Norma's towel fell away as she
desperately tried to grab him and stop him entering the narrow passage
by the tumble drier.

In conclusion :-

Never, ever place Xmas wrapping paper tubes into your Hamster/Gerbil
cage, thinking 'This will be fun' - it won't.
