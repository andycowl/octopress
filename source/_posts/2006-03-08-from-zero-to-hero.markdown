Up by around 13,000 due to an arbitrary inbound link from the WordPress
[tags](http://wordpress.com/tags/) page

> Day 202. Technorati Rank: 173,971 (29 links from 16 sites)

However, this may be the last in the very popular 'From Zero' series for
two reasons:

1. I have exhausted all decent subject lines and puns starting 'From
   Zero'
2. Apart from creating a load of splogs or bribing people, I have
   exhausted all known avenues for inbound links

I may well now turn my attention to [PubSub](http://www.pubsub.com/)
where my ranking is a much more satisfying 66,425 (InLinks 0, OutLinks
0, Entries 0) and I simply do not believe that hurtful person who told
me PubSub only track a total of 66,426 blogs.
