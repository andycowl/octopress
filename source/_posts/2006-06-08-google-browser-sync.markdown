Well I can think of one thing.
Going on a lovely, romantic weekend city break and getting lost (and
wet) in the narrow backstreets of Venice. Then I eventually find an
Internet cafe but am horrified to discover that the computer is locked
down and I can't install Google Browser
[Sync](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2006/06/get-in-sync.html). My wife
would be absolutely livid.

Google have some
[innovative](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/06/06/google-spreadsheets/)
products but I honestly can't see this one being 'disruptive'.
[Blinklist](http://www.blinklist.com/), anyone ?
