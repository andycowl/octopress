Apart from a short-lived [crisis of confidence][] - after losing a Draft
post, I spontaneously migrated this blog to Wordpress as an interim hop
before completing 99% of a full blown migration to [Django-Mingus][]
which I then immediately discarded - I have used [Habari][] as my
preferred blogging platform for two and a half years.

It's been a while since the last major Habari release (0.6) but, because
I run the latest 0.7 development code (using SubVersion), the lengthy
gap and absence of a formal 0.7 release didn't particularly bother me.

However, the 0.6.4 release is pretty dated now and lots of new features
have been added and bugs fixed in the intervening 18 months. Also, I
think there are potential developers who are keen to get the latest and
greatest version of Habari so I was pleased to see that the Habari
project released a '[0.7 Developer Release][]' yesterday.
