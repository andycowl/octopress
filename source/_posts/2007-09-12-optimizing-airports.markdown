Spending a lot of time in airports is an occupational hazard in the
glamorous and fast moving world of IT consultancy. Most of us are
intimate with the various methods of tuning Oracle databases and Siebel
CRM but here are some quick tips about optimizing the airport
experience.

1. Most airlines have succeeded in
   [shifting](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/05/02/ba-online-check-in/)
   the massive queues from the check-in desks to smaller queues at the
   self-service kiosks. The most obvious method to avoid this is to
   check-in online and print out your own boarding pass from the
   comfort of the office. One word of
   [caution](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/01/18/caution-with-ba-online-check-in/) - ensure you have the hardcopy of the boarding pass in your hands
   before leaving the Web page. If, for any reason, printing is
   unsuccessful, it is impossible to check-in online a second time to
   print the page again. It is a little embarrassing to explain to the
   customer service agent that an unknown pre-sales guy mistakenly took
   your boarding pass as it was sandwiched between his 89 page RFC.
   Worse, it also wastes a lot of time.
2. Do not, under any circumstances, attempt to attach your own luggage
   labels thinking this will save time. The baggage label must be
   coiled in a loop Origami-style and stuck together in a very specific
   way. Please, I urge you, leave this to the experts at the Fast Bag
   Drop desk.
3. Look nervously at your shoes and repeatedly wipe your sweaty brow in
   the queue for security screening. This behaviour guarantees that you
   will be 'randomly selected' by BAA security
   [staff](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/01/16/revenge-of-the-baa-queue-monitor/)
   to go through the new full body scanner. Don't worry when other
   passengers start giggling as you are asked to raise both arms and
   stand on one leg to assume a star shape. Revenge will be sweet when
   you are re-introduced at the head of the queue in front of the X-ray
   machine, skipping 23 people and saving a vital 17 minutes.
4. In the current climate, passengers are increasingly asked to remove
   their belts and shoes as part of security checks. Save time by
   investing in a pair of black, leather slip-ons. No need to waste
   time struggling to tie up your shoe laces. Consider buying some
   tighter trousers that don't need a belt.
5. Always select a seat at the back of the plane. Do not think you will
   disembark quicker if you are located near the front of the aircraft.
   You won't. Everyone else thinks the same way so the most determined,
   forceful personalities will always be seated in rows 1-18. You also
   risk being struck by an oversized case (that should have gone into
   the hold) from the overhead lockers. Worse, your brain will be
   irradiated by the hordes of business types eagerly turning their
   mobile phones back on after being incommunicado for a whole 55
   minutes.
6. Make a date with
   [Iris](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/02/09/great-fun-with-iris/).
   In the UK, you can register to trial the optical recognition system
   at immigration. Watch your colleagues from Consulting gasp in
   amazement as you leave them behind in a lengthy queue as you waltz
   up to the empty Iris desk and quickly make your way out of the
   terminal.
7. Use a professional, competent taxi company and arrange to be
   collected at the airport. This may seem blindingly obvious but for
   reasons that now escape me, for a period, I used a completely
   incompetent
   [taxi](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/04/03/rude-awakening/)
   firm who were always late for the rendezvous, didn't have the right
   change for the car-park and couldn't even find my home address. The
   final straw came when they woke my family, in the middle of the
   night, by ringing my door bell at 05:45 for a 06:00 pickup.
8. The ever increasing capacity and falling prices of USB memory sticks
   now make it possible to think the unthinkable. Leave your laptop
   behind. Copy your mini-technical library onto a memory stick. I have
   done this on a couple of domestic engagements and it is truly
   liberating. My dodgy, aching back is also feeling the benefit. You
   can normally access SupportWeb, MetaLink and collect email from most
   customer sites.

One advantage of being severed from the laptop is that it really focuses
the mind on what technical material is truly essential to do your job.
Consequently, you incrementally build up relevant content on the stick.
It is also perfectly feasible to copy all your email folders onto a
memory stick. The only element I have occasionally missed is my own
Siebel 7.8/Oracle 10g sandbox environment. Have a good trip.
