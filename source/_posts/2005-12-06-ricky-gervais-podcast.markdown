Ricky Gervais is one of my favourite comedians (The Office, Extras) and
has produced the first in a series of
[podcasts](http://www.guardian.co.uk/rickygervais) for The Grauniad with
Stephen Merchant (co-writer) and Karl Pilkington (who has a hard time).

The podcast is 30 minutes of chat and improvisation but very funny.
