[Michael Brundage](http://www.qbrundage.com/michaelb/index.html) writes
an popular article about what it is really like to
[work](http://www.qbrundage.com/michaelb/pubs/essays/working_at_microsoft.html)
at Microsoft. Flexible working environment, minimal paperwork, hard
work, gripes about managers, free drinks. So nothing too earth
shattering or surprising there.

But what struck me about this blog is that it [isn't a
blog](http://www.qbrundage.com/michaelb/pubs/essays/this_is_not_a_blog.html).
It is simply a good old fashioned Web page.

No categories. No comments. No statistics. No trackbacks. No fancy
themes. No calendar. No widgets. No plugins.

Just words that fill most of the screen on a HTML page. And undoubtedly
the most interesting content I have stumbled across this week.
Sometimes, [less is
more](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/01/16/less-is-more-2/).
