Two weeks ago, I was working in the beautiful city of Oslo. After a
couple of hours, the client finally couldn't take any more of my tedious
hand-waving and badly drawn architecture diagrams so he suggested we had
a five minute coffee break.

In the immaculate pine kitchen, my eyes were drawn to a notice in
Norwegian affixed to the kitchen cupboard. One of my hosts smiled and
said 'I bet you don't know what that says'.

Quick as a flash, I replied 'Oh I bet you a pint of expensive beer that
I do.'
> 'Please, please wash up your plates and mugs. Your mother doesn't work
> here'

'God that is absolutely amazing. Why didn't you say you spoke Norwegian
?'

In a similar vein, Andrew

brings my attention to a marvellous
[blog](http://www.passiveaggressivenotes.com/) devoted to
passive-aggressive notices posted in office kitchens, officious post-its
stuck on fridge doors and not-so-polite notices hanging on toilet walls
from all around the world.

If only I'd known, I would have taken a photo of this British
