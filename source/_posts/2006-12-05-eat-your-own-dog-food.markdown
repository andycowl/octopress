I bought my children an advent calendar each to initiate the Christmas
celebrations (and shut them up).

As soon as my son got home from the supermarket, he eagerly ripped open
the little door panel for 1 December and wolfed down the chocolate.

As it was already the 3rd of December, I gently enquired whether I might
be allowed to sample the delicious chocolate for the 2nd December. He
agreed because he truly loves his father - 'Yes. Go on then although
they do taste a bit funny'.

I looked at the lovely advent calendar, admiring the wonderful Christmas
scenes.

Then I noticed it. Top left corner. In small print. Good Boy Advent
Calendar. For [Dogs](http://www.ukpetsupplies.com/detail.aspx?ID=1775).

Happy Christmas, son.
