Ten hours cooped up on a
[plane](http://consumerist.com/consumer/videos/customer-records-his-7+hour-delayed-flight-in-all-its-baby+screaming-glory-272901.php)
with facile excuses ('just another 10 minutes'), no food and screaming
babies for company.

Love the cheerful musical score, the facial expressions and the way the
video starts in daylight and ends in complete darkness.
