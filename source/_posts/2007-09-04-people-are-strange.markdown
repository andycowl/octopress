[Steve](http://bclc.wordpress.com/) has an admirable habit of titling
(almost) all of his posts with a line from a song.

Just went to the post office. I was in luck. Just one lady, with a
baby in a pushchair, posting a small parcel. Or so I thought.

'First class, please'

'That's &pound;2.57 please'.

'Oh - hang on. Do you think I should send this recorded ?'

[ She didn't ask what benefits recorded delivery offered versus
registered or plain first class. Even more odd was the postmaster's
reply ]

'Yes. I think you should.'

[ without asking about the contents of the parcel or outlining what
recorded delivery offers ]

'Yes. That will be &pound;3.74 for recorded'

Delay as he prints out the necessary orange labels

Delay as the lady takes an
[eon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eon_(geology)) to complete the
necessary labels.

Delay as the lady dutifully sticks the labels on the small parcel.

Delay as the lady coos to the baby 'There - that's all our jobs done.
Isn't that good ? All our jobs are done. Haven't we both done well ?'
Well, yours might be but I am still waiting.

Further delay as the lady unbelievably plucks out a debit card to pay
the massive sum of &pound;3.74.

Coincidentally, I am posting two parcels abroad but resist the
temptation to ask

'Hmm. Do you think I should send these recorded ?'

After all my jobs are complete (didn't I do well) in the Post Office, I
need some cash as I was perilously close to annoying the eight people
behind me in the queue by paying by debit card for a transaction
totalling &pound;7.68.

And so to the cashpoint. Again, I am in luck. Just one gentleman ahead
of me. Or so I thought.

He completes his transaction, withdraws his card so I make my advance. I
nearly bump into him as he submits his card again for another
transaction. He must be checking his balance.

Again, he finally completes this transaction and I nearly walk into him
as he pauses and initiates a third (well three that I have witnessed)
transaction.

Finally, after what seems an eternity he turns and walks away. I catch
his eye because I am wondering whether the machine has run out of cash
but no. Unbelievably, he mutters

'Nope. Doesn't want to give me any cash today. I'll have to try again
later.'

5 seconds later, I have successfully withdrawn &pound;100 so the
gentleman was either overdrawn and polling every 30 seconds to see
whether additional funds might have miraculously cleared or he was a
complete idiot.
