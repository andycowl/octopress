I believe [Michael
Shields](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1495692/Innocent-gentle-giant-Or-remorseless-thug-guilty-of-attempted-murder.html)
is guilty of attempted murder by dropping a paving slab on a Bulgarian
waiter's head, putting him in a coma for 4 days.

I find it worrying and bizarre that Jack Straw sees fit to grant Michael
Shields a '[Royal
Pardon](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/crime/article6827249.ece)'
in the light of an 'oral confession' made by another individual when
Shields' parents just happened to pay him a visit.

Particularly, when Jack Straw was fully aware of this information when
Shields returned to serve out the rest of his sentence in England back
in 2006 and rejected an appeal as recently at 2 July 2009.

I believe that the Bulgarian authorities correctly discounted the
written confession of Graham Sankey, made way back in July 2005 from the
safety of England, on the condition that he didn't stand trial.

Michael Shields was involved in football related violence. He should be
serving 15 years in jail for a vicious, unprovoked attack. He should not
be feted in the press as a gallant returning war hero. He should not be
allowed to attend another football match and should be the subject of a
banning order that prevents him from travelling abroad.

But he won't. Michael Shields will be leading the team out at
Liverpool's next home fixture and leading the singing of 'You'll never
walk alone.'

I don't know how the friends and family of Martin Georgiev feel but I
feel sick to my stomach and ashamed to be British.
