Just got my car a shiny, new MOT certificate as an early Christmas
present. The MOT certificate is a pre-requisite for renewing the tax
disc which expires at the end of the month.

The format of the MOT test certificate has changed and all MOT's will be
recorded on a computer system at the Vehicle and Operator Agency (VOSA).

This means that you can now apply for your road tax
[online](http://www.direct.gov.uk/Diol1/DoItOnline/DoItOnlineArticles/fs/en?CONTENT_ID=10021414&chk=EzpJ7+)
as VOSA can also verify that the vehicle is insured using another
computer system.

Good news for me. One less trip into the 
[Post Office](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2005/12/13/circular-discussions/).

Bad news for car criminals.
