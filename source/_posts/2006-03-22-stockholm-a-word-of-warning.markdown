Just because Prince Philip
[confirms](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/03/19/by-royal-appointment/)
your [hotel](http://www.princephilip.se/eng/index.php3) booking, don't
assume he will greet you at reception. He won't.

Just because a shopping mall is called
[Heron City](http://www.heroncity.se/stockholm_eng/index.html) and
contains water features, don't assume there will be herons. There
won't.

Just because you spent an hour in a taxi telling the driver, you are
flying on British Airways to London, don't assume he will drop you at
the correct terminal. He won't.
