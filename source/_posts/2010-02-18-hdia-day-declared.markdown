London, near England - Thursday 18 February 2010

British Prime Minister,
Gordon Brown, astounded the world today by announcing the total and
immediate withdrawal of all British troops from the current areas of
conflict in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Speaking exclusively to Piers Morgan
on a prime-time chat show with tears in his eye, Brown explained:
'During the course of the Chilcott Inquiry (led by that England rugby
prop forward), a few facts became clear; Tony Blair misled Parliament
and lied to the British public.'

'There were never any Weapons of Mass
Destruction in Iraq. We are fighting a war we can never win in
Afghanistan. The time has finally come to bring 'our boys' home. We have
lost over 250 young men in Afghanistan. Enough is enough and there's an
election imminent.'

'A total of 12,500 troops will return home immediately from the
theatres of war in the middle-east and Afghanistan.  They will be
fully de-briefed and given clean underpants. Then they will return
home to their families for emotional reunions. Finally, the daily
funerals of brave bomb disposal experts in Wootton Bassett are over.
Seven TV crews and an opportunistic florist will also be recalled to
London today.'

'This is not a day for trite soundbites but I can feel the hand of
history on my shoulder. This day shall be a Public Holiday to be
forever known as 'Honourable Draw in Iraq and Afghanistan' Day (HDIA
Day).'

'On Monday, all the 12,500 members of the armed forces will all pack
up their kit, say a tearful good bye and fly out to The Falklands to
defend our newly found oil reserves from those pesky Argies.'
