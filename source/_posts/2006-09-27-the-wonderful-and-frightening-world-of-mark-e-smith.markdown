BBC2 Friday night. A [repeat](http://www.thefall.info/fallsite/?p=320)
but memorable for some great footage, interviews and these two
[quotes](http://homepages.shu.ac.uk/~llrdjb/fall_doc.pdf) from Mark E.
Smith

> John Walters wrote me a letter and said, you know, 'you are the worst
> group I've ever seen in the [laughs] in the history of mankind'
> [laughs]. He was good like that, John Walters was. You ever meet him?
> No, he was f\*\*king fantastic. He said, 'you were the worst,
> tuneless, rubbish I've ever heard', you know, 'even worse than
> Siouxsie and the Banshees'. This is what he wrote 'you're even worse
> than Siouxsie and the Banshees. I didn't believe it was possible.' You
> know what I mean? [laughs] He was a gem, what a gem. He said, 'please
> do a session' [laughs].
>
> All the group stayed up to watch the Old Grey Whistle Test. Not that I
> would, personally but you couldn't see the group, that was the
> funniest bit. They stayed up to watch
> [it](http://youtube.com/watch?v=J8W9sQJaAdM) with all their parents
> [cackles]. And all you could see was like Michael Clark baring his
> arse on the f\*\*king screen, you know. F\*\*king great. It was dead
> funny.
