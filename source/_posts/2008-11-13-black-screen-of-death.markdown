Last night, I flew home to London from Hamburg, near Germany. The flight
was punctual and uneventful enough apart from the fact I was sitting
next to a blind man.

When the seat belts sign extinguished, he got his laptop out, booted up
and started typing into a completely black screen. So, I assumed he must
be blind and using a braille keyboard.

However, this gentleman wasn't blind. He had been reading 'High Life'
while we taxied onto the runway. Oh and he also had a
[complimentary](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2005/10/22/british-mentality/)
copy of the Financial Times.

There was only one conclusion - this was a security measure to stop
inquisitive neighbours peeping at his screen and reading confidential
documents and email correspondence.

This could only mean one thing - the gentleman worked for a Government
agency, probably MI6 or was the CEO of a FTSE100 company.

Although it killed my last three cats, two hamsters and seventeen
tropical fish, curiosity got the better of me and I painstakingly
reverse engineered all of my neighbour's typing by analysing his actual
keystrokes in real-time.

Here is the exclusive transcript...

> To: Sebastian Browning (VP marketing)\
>  Cc: UK Marketing\
>  Subject: logistics for Partner Golf day\
>
> Due to the current 'difficult and challenging times', the Partner Golf
> day at The Old Course, St Andrews has been cancelled. However, as I
> know a lot of you had customers booked and after my pledge to do
> 'anything it takes', I am delighted to tell you an alternative, lower
> cost venue has been found.
>
> We will now meet at Solihull municipal Crazy Golf course at 2pm on
> Friday 28 November. Looking forward to meeting you and your customers.
> Alan will send handicaps and pairings out next week.

There now followed a 5 minute lull - no typing - just a frenzy of
trackerball activity punctuated by various muttered expletives. The most
likely cause was the poor individual trying to resize a picture within a
Microsoft Word document. Then back to the 782 messages lying in 'Inbox'.

> To: Bernard Barnstormworth (Director Fins)\
>  Subject: status on Megabank opportunity\
> Megabank is dead. The client was expecting to be hosted at The
> Emirates to see Arsenal versus Manchester United followed by dinner at
> The Ivy. What they got was a mini-bus to Leyton Orient against
> Hartlepool and some cockles and mussels at half-time. The CEO just
> called me to say the deal is off.

Another pause for thought to consume a cheese sandwich and a glass of
water.

> To: Hannah Brown (IT security)\
>  Subject: privacy and security\
> Hannah - As per your recent memo, my two hard disks are now fully
> encrypted and I have affixed the privacy screen overlay to my laptop.
> I must say it is absolutely fantastic to be able to work without

> PS. Please can you order me a new 4GB USB memory stick ? I can't find
> it anywhere. Must have lost it in Hamburg.
