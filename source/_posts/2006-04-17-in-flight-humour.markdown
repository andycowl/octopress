I enjoyed these [quotes](http://funny2.com/inflight.htm) from airline
staff with a sense of humour (via [Tom
Kyte](http://tkyte.blogspot.com/2006/04/just-for-fun.html)).

A couple of years ago, I was on a British Airways flight that was making
its final approach to some anonymous airport in Scandanavia.

Quite suddenly and without any warning, the landing was aborted. The
plane stopped descending, quickly started to climb, levelled out and
then resumed a familiar, circular holding pattern.

I was a little perturbed but no-one else seemed bothered as though this
was perfectly normal so I stopped screaming, apologised to my immediate
neighbours, dabbed the sweat from my brow with a napkin and picked up my
copy of 'High Life'.

The pilot announced:

> 'Ladies and Gentlemen. You have probably noticed that we have been
> unable to land and are in a now holding pattern. This is because the
> aircraft in front struck a bird during landing and the ground staff
> are currently clearing the runway of debris so it is safe for us to
> land. British Airways apologises for the delay to your onward journey
> and the inconvenience caused. However, please spare a thought for the
> poor bird.'

Of course, the last sentence was my input but what a glorious, wasted
opportunity.
