Sometimes your faith in humanity is restored.

The [DEC Haiti appeal](http://www.dec.org.uk/donate_now/) has raised over 
[&pound;25 million](http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/rwb.nsf/db900SID/SKEA-7ZUGXX?OpenDocument)
just from the news coverage alone. This exceeds the &pound;20 million
raised by last year's [Children in Need](http://www.bbc.co.uk/pudsey/)
campaign which (while still a worthy cause) is mercilessly peddled and
trailed by the BBC for two long weeks.

Don't forget to mark your donation as 'Gift Aid' which allows DEC to
reclaims 28p for every pound given.
