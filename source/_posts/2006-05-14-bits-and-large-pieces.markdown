Oracle have an interesting collaborative project
([MegaGrid](http://www.oracle.com/technologies/grid/megagrid.html)) to
develop a very large grid database designed to stretch technical and
infrastructure resources to the absolute limit.

I also gathered from the informative US news media that a cat had been
trapped up a tree in a Seattle suburb and that (shock, horror, gasp) the
US Government has secretly been
[tracking](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/11/AR2006051100539.html%20)
all phone calls since 9/11.

This appeared to be a big, breaking news story but seeing as US
immigration took the trouble to take my fingerprints and photograph on
entry to (and departure from) the US, I honestly didn't think that the
Homeland Security department would simply discard this data.

The US authorities must have some interesting infrastructure to store
all this data. I wonder if their database exceeds the
[largest](http://www.wintercorp.com/VLDB/2005_TopTen_Survey/TopTenWinners_2005.asp)
commercial database (Yahoo's 100TB data warehouse on Oracle).
