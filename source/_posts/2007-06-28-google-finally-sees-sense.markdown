On the face of it, the recent changes to the interface to Google Docs
and Spreadsheets look trivial and superficial.

Google's official announcement is
[brief](http://google-d-s.blogspot.com/2007/06/entirely-new-way-to-stay-organized.html)
and understated but Google
[Blogoscoped](http://blog.outer-court.com/archive/2007-06-27-n12.html)
hits the nail on the head (twice):
> 'The file listing now resembles a more traditional view in the style
> of, say, Windows Explorer.'

...that ordinary mortals understand and are comfortable with.
> 'Google D&S looks more and more like an office application.'

In fact, Google Docs looks and performs much better than the most
popular office application. I recently upgraded three home PC's to
Office 2007. I think Microsoft Office is a superb suite of professional
applications (Word, Excel, OneNote) and represents great value for money
as &pound;85 buys licenses for use on three separate PC's.

Inevitably though, my wife hated the new Word interface (shock of the
new) because 'everything had changed' and she could not easily locate
the old 'Print' button or even 'File-Print'.

My wife doesn't use Google Docs and now she has mastered Word 2007, she
probably never will.

However, if she ever does, it will be easy to teach her how to migrate.
If she wants to print a document, she clicks the 'Print' button or the
pretty picture of a printer. This is completely intuitive and obvious.
She won't have to call the Helpdesk and interrupt the Champions League
Final just to print two copies of her CV.

If my wife wants to delete a document, she either selects the document
and clicks 'Delete'. Alternatively, if she has successfully completed my
3 days 'Advanced Course' (a bargain at &pound;150) and is officially
certified, she simply drags the document to the dustbin. Two choices.
Both quick, easy and obvious.

Another occasional task my wife needs help with is finding her CV. She
keeps all 178 documents in 'My Documents'. She doesn't archive files by
year. She doesn't remember that she last updated the CV in May 2003 nor
does she know whether the document is named 'CV', 'Curriculum Vitae' or
'CV-Full' or 'CV-May-2003' .

She can't fathom out the search interface from within Word (nor can I)
and does not know that you can search for Word documents from a
completely different application - Windows Explorer. She simply wants to
find her CV. From within Word. Quickly.

In Google Docs, she types 'CV' in the 'Search' box and is offered all
the available possibilities with intelligent auto-complete.

This isn't patronising. This is all about usability, interface design
and mass market appeal.

If Auntie Beryl writes yet another letter to her bank, she simply drags
it to the 'Letters' folder. She doesn't need to know that this isn't
really a folder and the document is now tagged as 'Letter'.

Uncle Harry doesn't need to know the definition and intricacies of
[folksonomies](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/06/22/wiphone222.xml).
He doesn't care that, strictly speaking, this document could also be
multiply tagged 'Bank' and 'Personal'. He just wants to type the letter,
run a spell checker, quickly print the thing and make the 5 o'clock
collection.

I honestly believe, in the future, this seemingly trivial change will be
viewed as the turning point when Google changed from a marginal, Web 2.0
application and started to offer a credible alternative to Microsoft
Office (for personal but not corporate users - yet). This was the day
that non Web 2.0 users can now be introduced to Docs and actually
understand and use it.

Ironically, the revamped Google Docs
[interface](http://google.blognewschannel.com/archives/2007/06/27/google-docs-gets-better-file-organization/)
is very reminiscent of the Web based interface of Office 2007 which is
another excellent software product and unbelievably close to the desktop
equivalent.
