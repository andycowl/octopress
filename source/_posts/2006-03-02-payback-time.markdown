I'd just like to say that my Palm Vx repaid me today for a small element
of all the valuable time it has wasted in the past.

A recent change in circumstance meant some changes to my email
environment.

Easy enough to resolve. Synchronise old environment with Palm. Switch
into new environment. Reconfigure Outlook profile. Synchronise.
Contacts, Tasks, Calendar and Notes all migrated seamlessly. Finished.

Well, I'd like to but I can't.
