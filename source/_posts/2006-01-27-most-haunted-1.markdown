I have been playing a CD in my car on Disc-Random-Shuffle mode for ten
weeks. The CD contains close to 200 songs. I have heard all the songs
once, some twice and a handful three times.

This morning, I heard something that sent a shiver down my spine,
chilled my bones and momentarily froze me to the spot.

'[Spectre versus Rector'](http://www.lyricscrawler.com/song/86355.html)
by The Fall. This 'song' is a 8 minute rant from Mark E. Smith accompanied 
by some noise, detailing a ghostly story from the 'Dragnet' LP. 
'Spectre versus Rector' sounds as if it was recorded in a bleak, industrial 
warehouse somewhere up North with a hand-held tape recorder.

The very last song to be selected. Spooky.
