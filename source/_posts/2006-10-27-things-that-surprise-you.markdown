I am slowly trying to fully assimilate and comprehend these facts:

1. Google is now worth
   [more](http://google.blognewschannel.com/index.php/archives/2006/10/25/google-passes-ibm-to-become-3-tech-company/)
   then IBM
2. IBM invest a lot of
   [resources](http://andypiper.wordpress.com/2006/10/26/stuff-ibmers-have-done-in-second-life/)
   in [SecondLife](http://secondlife.com/) while I am still resistant
   to
   [IM](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/08/04/am-i-a-technology-luddite/).
3. Manchester United placed posters of Liverpool's past successes in
   the visitors section at Old Trafford. Rumour has it the pictures
   were only black and white but were still stolen after Liverpool's
   recent 2-0 defeat.
