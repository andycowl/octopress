I am bored of tormenting myself, conjuring up full blown blog posts,
pouring over non-existent Adsense revenues and analyzing traffic
statistics so I have started a [Tumblelog](http://andyc.tumblr.com/).

There is something very appealing about Kottke's
[definition](http://www.kottke.org/05/10/tumblelogs) of a Tumblelog as
'a quick and dirty stream of consciousness.'

A Tumblelog can be a short, snappy blog and can also aggregate different
RSS feeds (Google Shared Stuff and Items, del.icio.us, last.fm, Flickr
and even this blog). Why, [Tumblr](http://www.tumblr.com/) even has
built-in support for quotes.

However, undoubtedly the best feature is the endless scope for puns in
the non rotating taglines:

-   [Rowche Tumble](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Fall/_/Rowche+Rumble)
-   Are you ready to Tumble ?
-   Tumble Dryer
-   Tumble in the jungle
-   A bit of rough and Tumble
-   Don't mumble, Tumble !

I have already contacted [Davidville](http://davidville.com/) to enquire
about any openings in sales and marketing.
