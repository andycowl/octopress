Despite occasionally enjoying this [site](http://thedailywtf.com/) and
subscribing to this Oracle focussed
[offshoot](http://oracle-wtf.blogspot.com/), I always laid awake at
night, endlessly tossing and turning, wondering what this curious and
cryptic acronym WTF stood for.

I need wonder no more. [Technorati](http://technorati.com/) have finally
put me out of my misery.

[WTF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTF) actually stands for
'[Where's The Fire](http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/01/31/technoratis-mysterious-disappearing-wtf-product/)
?' My immediate reaction was '[WTF](http://www.wtf.org/) ?'

No wonder Technorati killed that product at birth.
