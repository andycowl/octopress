'OK. OK. I give in. Please stop hurting me, Brin. I now realise that
resistance is futile.'

'Look I did what you asked. I have now converted to Google Reader.
Please, no more. I will do anything you want. Please, Sergey - let my
wife go.'

Even my son (newly hired Google enforcer) has now installed Google
Desktop and is busy indexing the entire contents of the PC.

Just about the only remaining product in the Google portfolio I don't
use is Adsense.

Am I a fully fledged Google
[whore](http://flickr.com/photos/70276096@N00/395284420/) yet ? If not,
what else do I need to do ?

'Oh no - you've discovered I am not using Blogger. No Sergey. Please. I
beg you. Please, Brin. Show some mercy. Not the pliers and electrical
cord. Please stop. Aaaarrgghhh. I give in. Please stop now.'
