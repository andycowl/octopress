This [sign](http://www.flickr.com/photos/70276096@N00/403356821/) in my
hotel room intrigued me. Every time I entered the bathroom, I gazed at
the [sign](http://www.flickr.com/photos/70276096@N00/403356821/). I
found myself entering the bathroom to study the sign when I didn't
actually need to use the bathroom.

Was the pipe hot or not ? Unfortunately, this towel rail wasn't listed
anywhere on this [site](http://hotornot.com/). Could the temperature
really be as high as 140' F ? How hot is 140' F ?

Finally, just before I checked out, I gave in to temptation, removed the
towels and grabbed the silver rail with my right hand.

The appliance was indeed hot, very hot, dangerously hot. Scaldingly hot,
in fact.

I stretched my left arm to reach outside the bathroom door around to my
laptop on the desk. I then somehow managed to type with my left hand and
agonisingly Googled to find out how exactly long I could endure this
torture before incurring a third degree burn.

The [answer](http://www.med.umich.edu/1libr/pa/pa_hotwatr_hhg.htm) - 6
seconds. Unfortunately, thanks to my restricted movement and the
agonising pain, it took me a full 45 seconds to discover this vital
fact.

Finally, I could bear it no longer so I released my right hand and sunk
it under the blissful sanctuary of the cold water tap at full blast.

I slowly gathered my bags, proceeded to check out (left handed) and told
the receptionist that my lawyers would be in touch.
