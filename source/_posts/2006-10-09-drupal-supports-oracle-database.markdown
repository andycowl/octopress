Just installed and configured
[Drupal](http://www.nbrightside.com/drupal-4.7.3/) 4.7.3 and noted an
[announcement](http://drupal.org/node/87073) asking for volunteers to
test newly added support for the Oracle database.

Most open source, content management systems (WordPress, Joomla et al)
use [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/) so it will be interesting to see
whether there is much demand for a CMS running on an Oracle database.

On a similar note, Oracle are likely to
[confirm](http://www.informationweek.com/software/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=193105248&subSection=Enterprise+Applications)
that the next major release of Siebel (8.0) will be available on the
Linux platform. The official announcement is expected at Oracle
[OpenWorld](http://www.oracle.com/openworld/index.html) later this
month. This isn't wholly unexpected as support for Linux in Siebel 8.0
was included in the public Statement of Direction (May 2006).

The availability of the Siebel on Linux is is likely to be an attractive
option for smaller companies, some of whom who already deploy the Siebel
database on a Linux platform.
