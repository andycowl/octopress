Arrived at a client's offices in Birmingham this morning just as Radio
Five news reported a major [power
cut](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/west_midlands/5230032.stm)
affecting businesses and homes in the area.

Apparently, vandals had set fire to two tyres and rolled them into the
electricity sub-station last night.

Whatever happened to the good old days of getting drunk, singing songs
and placing red cones on top of traffic lights.

Still, the outage freed up two hours for an interesting discussion about
disaster recovery.
