Knowledge management presents a difficult challenge particularly when
you work in a relatively small department of highly intelligent,
technical consultants who are scattered around the globe and travel a
lot.

I just started another blog as an experiment to see whether we can try
to improve the way in which we share knowledge and communicate with each
other. Searching email archives is so 1990's, don't you think ?

The blogging interface and the set of CMS features isn't as rich as
WordPress (or alternative Content Management
[Systems](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/01/26/resisting-the-lure-of-joomla/))
but that's not really the point.

Oh and another thing. Unless you happen to work for Oracle Corporation,
you can't actually see this embryonic blog. Sorry.
