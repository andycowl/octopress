Dear Peter Crouch

Listen to Gary
[Neville](http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/world_cup_2006/teams/england/5139040.stm).
This time, there are no
[excuses](http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/world_cup_2006/teams/england/5145092.stm).
No ifs, buts or
[maybes](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/05/18/if-buts-and-maybes/).
The hangovers have subsided. We have all taken those stupid flags off
our cars and are now looking forward to next season. Let's face it -
England simply weren't good enough.

As you had only played 60 minutes football and were the only recognised
striker on the pitch, I wondered why you didn't step up for one of the
first four penalties ?

Then I remembered - it was probably because of memories of your last
ludicrous, pathetic, laughable attempt at a penalty against
[Jamaica](http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/world_cup_2006/teams/england/5040586.stm)
in a recent friendly.

Yours sincerely
