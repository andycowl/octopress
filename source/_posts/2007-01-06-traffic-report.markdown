The year end always sees lots of people post meaningless stats about
blog traffic. Unfortunately, I only have tracking data since my move to
Bluehost in late September but I am not going to let that stop me.
Google Analytics
[reports](http://flickr.com/photos/70276096@N00/347709488/):-

-   4,709 visits
-   8,036 page views
-   1.71 pages per visit
-   3,902 unique visitors

[ Note the almost linear growth in visitors over the three months. It
took me ages to get that perfect straight line ] Of course, these
traffic numbers are bitterly disappointing so, to cheer myself up, I
analyze the AwStats
[reports](http://flickr.com/photos/70276096@N00/347709491/in/photostream/)
for the same period. This makes me feel much better.

-   13,738 visits
-   54,266 page views
-   68,858 hits (even better !)
-   3.95 pages per visit
-   6,002 unique visitors

[AwStats](http://awstats.sourceforge.net/) includes robots, spiders,
crawlers and spam automatons whereas Google Analytics only counts human
beings (and cats). Worse, Google
[Analytics](https://www.google.com/analytics/) filters out my own visits
and referrals from the WordPress dashboard (which accounts for 97% of
traffic) ! Oh no. What's this ? Feedburner are now
[offering](http://blogs.feedburner.com/feedburner/archives/2007/01/a_360_degree_view_of_audience_1.php)
even more blog tracking statistics and reports.
