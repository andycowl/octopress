The scheduling goddess has granted me a second successive week in
[Birmingham](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/07/31/wheels-on-fire/);
West Bromwich to be precise. I was shocked to discover that, following
my unfavourable
[review](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2005/12/21/hostelries-in-west-bromwich/)
last December, the Days Inn Hotel has subsequently been taken over by
the budget chain, Premier Travel Inn.

My greeting at reception wasn't too promising: 'Ah - Good evening Mr.
Brightside. A double smoking room, I believe'. 'Err no. I booked a
single, non-smoking room if you have one please.'

I entered my room which was very hot, in fact, it was 'smoking'. The
'Info' button on the thermostat revealed the temperature was a stifling
29.5'C.

I went to open the windows but they were sealed. I went to turn down the
thermostat - to a more reasonable 18'C. Ah - that's better. Just unpack
and wait for the room to cool down.

Then, unusually for me, I read the small print in the fine manual.
> 'Set room temperature with 'Up' and 'Down' buttons. This controls the
> heater operation but cannot cool the room.'

I think it's time to see what price, and temperature, the Boddingtons is
served at.
