Most companies I viist have a (subsidised) coffee shop so I am used to
waiting for my morning coffee and hearing a wide variety of exotic
concoctions called out to the eager, caffeine starved workforce.

-   'Large Mocha'
-   'Tall, skinny Latte'
-   'Overpriced Tea'
-   'Decaf Americano'
-   'Espresso with an extra shot'
-   'Frothy Cappucino with extra froth'
-   'Pomegranate Peach Frappuccino'

But this morning, I was privileged to hear a new and exciting drink
announced.
> 'Grandee Hot Water'
