Oracle 11g has recently been
[released](http://www.oracle.com/technology/products/database/oracle11g/index.html)
so it's time for
[everyone](http://www.oracle-base.com/articles/11g/OracleDB11gR1InstallationOnEnterpriseLinux4and5.php)
to submit their colourful
[screenshots](http://www.dizwell.com/prod/node/930) into the 'Oracle 11g
banner version' competition. Well,
[nearly](http://oracledoug.com/serendipity/index.php?/archives/1308-Does-Anyone-Know-When-11g-Will-Be-Released.html)
everyone.

Apologies for the delay but, finally, I am proud to present my paltry,
monochrome
[effort](http://picasaweb.google.com/nbrightside/Blog/photo#5098294974988339106).

I just installed Oracle 11g onto a
[VMware](http://www.vmware.com/products/ws/) server running
[Redhat](http://www.redhat.com/rhel/) Enterprise Linux 4.0. It actually
took me more time to configure VMware tools and successfully share the
folder staging the distribution than to install and configure Oracle.

The virtual server had a mere 512MB of memory and was hosted on a
Thinkpad T43 laptop with 2GB memory.
