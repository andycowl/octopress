Back in May, I went along to my son's school to hear James Cracknell
speak. Cracknell is an old boy of KGS and went on to become a double
Olympic gold medalist. Since his retirement from rowing, Cracknell has
embarked on a series of endurance challenges. Cracknell supplements his
income by writing for the Daily Telegraph and also gives after dinner
speeches about his adventures as well as motivational talks at corporate
events.

On a balmy May evening, I entered the school building and was pleasantly
surprised to see free champagne being dispensed to guests on arrival. I
stepped forward to the temporary bar to claim my complimentary glass of
bubbly. ‘Are you a Governor, Sir ?' ‘Err, no.' ‘Well - are you with the
VIP party, Sir ?' - the gentleman gestured to my right where I saw the
Headmistress chatting with Cracknell. ‘Err, well, err, no.' And with
that, the smartly dressed waiter, nodded disdainfully towards the Sixth
Form Common room where I was able to claim my free class of orange
squash in a plastic tumbler.

If Norman Junior III had been with me, this exchange would have been
excruciatingly embarrassing for him but sadly he couldn't be bothered
coming along.

Before the main event, I paid a quick visit to the toilet and I noticed
James Cracknell, still politely chatting with the VIP's, wearing an
immaculate charcoal grey suit, with a spotless white collared shirt and
no tie. To my horror, my eyes were drawn to his feet. He was wearing
trainers. One of my pet hates - idiotic commuters wearing suits and
trainers. Oh well, he's won two Olympic Gold medals so I guess he can
wear whatever he likes.

Cracknell was a very personable, engaging, natural speaker and treated
us to a quick run through his career including his Olympic triumphs, an
insight into the level of commitment required to succeed at the highest
level of competitive sport and his trip to the South Pole. Sensibly,
Cracknell supplemented his talk with lots of photos. Interestingly, he
seemed to focus on his occasional failure (fourth in the rowing World
Championships in 2003) as much as his many successes.

James Cracknell is a very articulate, modest and amusing man. He
described failure at the World Championships as ‘doing what we normally
do. Train like hell for two years, getting up at 5am to get onto the
water on those dark, freezing winter mornings, qualify, get to the
final, push yourself to the limit, cross the finish line then stand on a
podium standing next to your best mate [Matthew Pinsent] who is crying
like a baby. Again'.

When Cracknell was selected to join the coxless four for the 2000
Olympic Games in Sydney, he was the newcomer into an established boat
with Olympic Gold Medalists, Steve Redgrave (4 Gold Medals) and Matthew
Pinsent (3 Gold medals) Understandably, he was a little intimidated by
these two and German coach, Juergen Grobler, attempted to reassure him

> ‘Listen, James. You are strong. You are an excellent athlete with
> great stamina and rowing technique. However, in this boat, you are
> sitting behind Matthew. He is a better rower than you, stronger than
> you with more stamina. All you have to do is follow him. Just do what
> he does. Follow his stroke. Follow his every move. When he eases off,
> you ease off. When he pushes the rate up to 43, you push the rate up
> to 43. Matthew is hung like a horse.'

A few months later, Cracknell was recounting this story about Juergen's
motivational chat to Redgrave who smiled and said “I think Juergen
probably said ‘He has lungs like a horse'.”

Cracknell then described his first endurance event when he rowed across
the Atlantic with Ben Fogle. Towards the end of the race, the satellite
radio wasn't working properly so the pair could only get daily updates
on their position and the state of the race.

One call told them they were now positioned second with 36 hours to go.
Fogel's reaction was ‘Second - brilliant. What an achievement. Fantastic
!' whereas Cracknell's immediate reaction was ‘Right - let's stop these
3 hours on (rowing), 45 minutes off (rest) shifts and switch to 4 hours
one, 30 minutes off and see if we can win this bloody thing'.

Cracknell then solved the mystery of the immaculate grey suit and
trainers. He had recently returned from the Marathon Des Sables
endurance event where he had finished 12th in a race, the highest ever
placing for a Briton. During the 151 mile race across the Sahara desert
-, his feet were badly blistered - Cracknell showed an awful photograph
of his red raw feet after a day in the desert which he described as
‘slight chafing' - which explained the trainers and his slight limp as
he took to the stage.

Cracknell answered a question about how he motivated himself and he
referred to a note scribbled on a blackboard in a History classroom he
had seen earlier that evening on a tour of his old s 

Cracknell answered a question about how he motivated himself and he
referred to a note scribbled on a blackboard in a History classroom he
had seen earlier that evening on a tour of his old school. Some wag
had written 'All things must pass' which summed up his attitude pretty
well.

[ After I saw Cracknell, I was shocked to hear he had been knocked off
his cycle by a speeding truck when attempting another challenge to
cross the States in 18 days, rowing, cycling and running. Cracknell
was seriously ill with head injuries but thankfully is now making a
good recovery ]
