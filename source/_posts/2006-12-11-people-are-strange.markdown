The couple in front of me at the (not so very) fast baggage drop had an
overnight bag and two carrier bags containing bottles of whiskey and
cigarettes. Much to my surprise, they expressed a wish to check the
carrier bags into the hold and take the hold-all on board.

The lady behind the desk explained that this wouldn't be possible or
really sensible.

Much to my surprise (and that of the lady from BMI), a heated exchange
then took place where the lady appeared to claim, in no uncertain terms,
that she 'knew this would happen' and this mess was 'all your fault.'

To my amazement, they proceeded to unpack the hold-all and put the
contents in the carrier bags. I quickly averted my gaze in case the
lady's underwear was going to be exhibited. The couple then placed their
'luggage' into the carrier bags and wrapped the bottles in the hold-all.

Triumphantly, they placed the hold-all on the conveyor belt and stated:
'Just one bag for the hold, please.'

No need to ask 'Did you pack this bag yourself ?'

Weird.
