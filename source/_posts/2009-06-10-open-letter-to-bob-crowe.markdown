Dear Bob

Congratulations on disrupting the lives of millions of Londoners by
calling a two day tube strike. Nice timing, by the way. An England
international at Wembley and more importantly; The Fall, Buzzcocks and
John Cooper Clarke live at Kentish Town.

Just a couple of quick questions before I set off:
-   I would also like a 5% pay rise which would come in most handy in
    these tense, difficult times. Also, the prospect of a guaranteed
    final pension and a job for life is also very appealing. I am
    certainly capable of reading a Red/Green/Amber signal, moving a
    lever from 'Stop' to 'Go' while reading a copy of 'The Sun'. Please
    email me if any vacancies come up.
-   Obviously, I would like to show my whole hearted support for the RMT
    cause by hooting my (imaginary) horn and making a small financial
    contribution to the fighting fund. I will be passing though most of
    the mainline stations on my extended journey tonight so maybe you
    could picket there where the London commuting public can see you
    instead of hiding in your office car park - you cowardly bastards.

Your comrade, Norman.
