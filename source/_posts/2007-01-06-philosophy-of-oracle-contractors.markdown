My. How times change. In my day, the philosophy was simple:

-   Always be sick in your own time.
-   Ensure a newspaper is safely cached behind the toilet cistern.
-   Arrive and leave the office 30 seconds before/after your manager.
-   Get an urgent pager alert whenever your round is imminent.
-   Be quick to claim credit and divert blame.

But no. I have now finally discovered the true Oracle Contractors
[Philosophy](http://www.oraclecontractors.com/philosophy.php).
