Last week, I travelled to Hamburg, near Germany, on business. As Mark
Burgess (lead singer of The Chameleons) now lives there, I took the
opportunity to send an email to one of my all-time heroes (even though
he is a City fan).

Unfortunately, I guess Mark must be busy with his musical commitments as
I haven't had the courtesy of a reply (yet).

> Excuse the intrusion but I am coming to Hamburg tomorrow on business.

> 1.  Location of Sports Bar that serves Boddies or strong German lager
>     and will be showing MUFC versus QPR (Carling Cup).
> 2.  Music venue with decent indie live music. My favourite bands are
>     The Smiths, The Fall, The Chameleons, Pixies, Nirvana, Joy
>     Division, Interpol, Editors, R.E.M though not necessarily in that
>     order. Bands doing cover versions of any of the above are
>     automatically excluded.
> 3.  Decent bar where I can get a pint without being ripped off or
>     beaten up.

> PS. Enjoyed your book (which you kindly signed) a lot apart from the
> last chapter that left me a bit cold.

> Peace, love, empathy - Andy
