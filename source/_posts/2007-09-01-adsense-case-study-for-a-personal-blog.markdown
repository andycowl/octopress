title: Adsense case study for a personal blog

One of the reasons I
[decided](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/05/23/sit-back-and-watch-the-money-roll-in/)
to put Adsense on this blog was out of sheer curiosity. There are plenty
of Google sponsored
[case studies](https://www.google.com/adsense/static/en_US/Success.html)
available from American shoe shops that significantly increased sales
and revenues using Adsense.

Successful blogger [John Chow](http://www.johnchow.com/) is totally and
refreshingly
[transparent](http://www.johnchow.com/john-chow-dot-com-blog-income-report-july-2007/)
with all his various revenue streams but I didn't have a clue what
income (if any) a small-time blogger might expect.

So, here - drum roll, please - are the revenue figures for this blog for
the first 3 months

-   July - $8.31
-   August -$8.33
-   September - $8.77

Not a massive amount but certainly more than I expected and enough to
cover my hosting costs with Bluehost. This is from a blog with around
100 daily visitors (mainly one-hit wonders from Google).
I used a simple wide banner
([Leaderboard](https://www.google.com/adsense/static/en_GB/AdFormats.html))
with 3/4 adverts and blended the background into the theme. Initially
the banner was on the footer but after a few days, I moved the ad to the
header section ('above the fold').

What is quite interesting is that, for various
[reasons](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/08/28/confessions-of-a-blog-addict/),
I hardly posted to the blog in August (5 posts versus 25 and 23 in July
and June respectively) yet the revenue (if you can call it that) was
consistent for each month. Also, the trend is upwards for each month -
just !

I briefly experimented with a 'Adsense for Search' box but it didn't
integrate well with my current theme
([plaintxtBlog](http://www.plaintxt.org/themes/plaintxtblog/)) so I
abandoned it.

Another fun element was watching the Google AdServer try to present
suitable adverts based on my content. Because I don't really signpost
things with flashing lights, at times Google displayed a fairly bizarre
and esoteric mix of (in)appropriate banner ads.

Some more facts and figures:

-   Most clicks in a day: 4
-   Most lucrative click: $1.64
-   Least lucrative click: $0.01 (yes, 1 cent)
-   Best day: 5 June 2007 ($2.16)
-   Worst day: $0.00 (too many to mention)
