OK. I couldn't resist any longer. Scoble's recent
[post](http://scobleizer.com/2007/07/15/google-reader-facebook-yummy/)
about this killer Google Reader application forced me to sign up for yet
another pointless, short-lived, social network, Web 2.0 application -
[Facebook](http://www.facebook.com).

I was keen to preserve my
'[Johnny Come Lately](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2005/08/23/firefox-and-thunderbird/)'
status and was relieved to find, coincidentally, that
[Donncha](http://ocaoimh.ie/2007/07/16/oh-facebook-i-feel-so-dirty/) had
signed up just ahead of me so I am now confirmed as the very last person
in the world to sign up for Facebook.

Scoble's right. Mario Romero's Google Reader
[application](http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php?id=2354684299)
is blissfully simple and lets you browse friends' shared items and
aggregates the most popular shared items. Once it gets enough traction,
this application will indeed be 'Digg for intelligent people' (and me).

Facebook is better than
[LinkedIn](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/03/03/linkedincom/)
because it's more human and it's more fun. That senior partner at
Accenture with a tedious, dry 6 page CV can now be seen half-naked, pole
dancing in Bangkok, juggling firesticks, laughing and simultaneously
drinking a colourful cocktail through a novelty straw.

Facebook is aimed at a teenage audience and people who snigger at 'Poke
Norman !' and I do have some difficulty with people writing
[graffiti](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/11/01/trick-or-treat/)
on my 'wall'.

For example, some cheeky Irish builder wrote this: 'Urgently needs
re-pointing. Can do you a deal if you get your drive done at the same
time.'
