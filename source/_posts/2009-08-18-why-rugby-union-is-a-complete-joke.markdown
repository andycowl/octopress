I like most sports but I hate rugby union with a passion for the
following reasons:

At (Grammar) school, I was forced to play rugby because it was somehow
viewed as 'character building'. On a cold, wet autumn day, a sports
master took one look at me and grunted 'You. Second row'. I then
proceeded to grab the crotch of the boy in front of me while a boy
behind me grabbed my crotch. I then had to insert my head between the
thighs of two boys in front of me.

If the scrum didn't collapse, which meant we had to start the prolonged
mating ritual all over again, eight lads would eventually extract our
body parts and look across the wet, muddy field in the hope that someone
was running somewhere with the ball. Of course, this never happened and
the sports master would be screaming 'Scrum it down, 'ere' so we would
have to run to the prescribed point (the only exercise we got all
afternoon) and start all over again. Brilliant, 'character building'
stuff.

At University, the Union Sports bar was notable for one thing only. It
was only hostelry out of the 27 available that was open during the early
afternoon hiatus between 2pm and 4pm. Consequently, we spent a lot of
time there - not because we played any competitive sport representing
the University but because we liked to drink all day long, if at all
possible.

Our long, wide ranging philosophical discussions were often interrupted
(particularly on a Wednesday) by people standing on the tables, singing
bawdy songs, loud and out of tune. As the afternoon proceeded, various
items of clothing would be discarded until they were fully naked,
singing their stupid, crude rugger bugger songs while we discussed
urgent, pressing, important matters of global interest (which bar should
we adjourn to next). That was just the women's first XV - things only
got worse when the blokes arrived fresh out of the showers,

And the final reason that rugby union is a complete joke - the
disciplinary code

-   [Spear
    tackle](http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/international/4376306.stm)
    (holding someone upside down and smashing their head into the ground
    which could potentially kill them) - no action.
-   [Eye
    gouging](http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/8122711.stm)
    (twisting your fingers hard into someone's eye socket which could
    result in the loss of an eye surprisingly enough) - 8 week ban.
-   [Feigning

    to seek a tactical advantage - 4 month ban for player (reduced from
    12 months after digging the dirt), 3 year ban for coach, 2 year ban
    for physio, &pound;260,000 fine for club.
