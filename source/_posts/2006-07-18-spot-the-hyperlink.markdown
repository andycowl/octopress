I was enjoying a scan through the archives of Andrew Sherman's incisive,
witty (and occasionally downright
[scary](http://andrewsherman.blogspot.com/2004/11/my-crow-costume-for-halloween.html))
[blog](http://andrewsherman.blogspot.com/) when I suddenly thought 'Hey
Andrew - where are the links ?'

Then I realised. The hyperlinks are actually embedded in the title which
is exactly where they should be.

At last. After 7 months, I have finally discovered something useful you
can do in Blogger which is not (currently) supported in WordPress.
