I really enjoyed this [comedy](http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/saxondale/)
co-written by Steve Coogan.

The opening sequence features Coogan struggling to keep his calm in an
'Anger Management' course and is always hilarious.

Unfortunately, the final episode of the series was on Monday night but,
no doubt, it will be endlessly repeated on BBC3 in the near future.
