'Dear Father - It is 6 weeks since my last confession. Since then I
have...'

-   Installed
    [Thunderbird 3](http://www.mozillamessaging.com/en-US/thunderbird/3.0/releasenotes/)
    which handles all my work email. This upgrade went smoothly enough
    although there were some minor glitches with server authentication
    and message filters. Thunderbird 3 adds tabs, UI enhancements, IMAP
    synchronisation, much needed improvements to the address book in
    addition to faster searching.

-   Upgraded my desktop PC to Linux
    [Mint 8](http://www.linuxmint.com/blog/?p=1155).
    Again, this went smoothly
    enough, mainly because I did a full blown install while carefully
    preserving my user data. Until Linux upgrades are 'rolling' and as
    easy as applying a Windows Service Pack, Linux will never succeed in
    the mainstream.

-   Installed
    [Google Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome?platform=linux&hl=en)
    on Mint 8. This was probably the only software I missed from Windows and
    God, I had forgotten how much faster Chrome is than Firefox. Chrome
    is blindingly fast on Linux, staggeringly fast, unbelievably fast.

-   Playing around with [DokuWiki](http://www.dokuwiki.org/dokuwiki) to
    replace Diigo and Google Notebook in an effort to use more open
    source software and get more of my data under my control.

-   Installed Laconica 0.8.2 so
    [Billy](http://www.nbrightside.com/laconica/index.php/billy) has his
    very own sandpit to play with spammers in.

-   Upgraded this blog to the latest bleeding edge of Habari (0.7 alpha)
    and was relieved to see it still worked.

'Go in peace, my son. Admirable efforts but my sources tell me you are
flagrantly continuing to use freedom hating, Microsoft TrueType Fonts to
enhance your browsing experience on Linux, so please say three Hail
Mary's and an Our Father as penance. Go in peace to love and serve RMS.'
