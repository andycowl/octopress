Google recently announced some
[enhancements](http://www.google.com/googlenotebook/newfeatures.html) to
the [Notebook](http://www.google.com/notebook) and I must admit that,
while the concept left me cold initially, I am now starting to make more
use of this software.

While I use [Blinklist](http://www.blinklist.com/) for shared (more
permanent) bookmarks, I tend to use Google Notebook for snippets,
jottings, interesting links and, err, notes that I may need to access
from both home and work (in fact potentially from any computer).

For example, yesterday I had a query about my online tax return and was
forced to call the pension administrator followed by the Inland Revenue
and jotted down answers to my questions.

Previously, I might have emailed myself the notes from work to home so I
then could write a followup letter. This would mean the information was
accessible from work (Sent) and home (Inbox) but having it available on
a Google server is preferable and less typing.

I used to keep draft blog postings in WordPress but didn't like the
drafts cluttering up the dashboard so now these random thoughts also get
stored in Google Notebook.

Obviously, all of my notebooks are private but there is some interesting
[information](http://www.google.com/notebook/search?q=oracle) out there
lurking in shared notebooks that isn't accessible from conventional
sources.
