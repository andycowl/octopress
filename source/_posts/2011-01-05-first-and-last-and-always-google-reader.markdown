Steve Rubel has
[resolved](http://www.steverubel.com/a-return-to-feed-reading-tops-my-2011-tech-re)
to return to feed reading in 2011.

However, I have been using Google Reader since 2007 and use it daily
to catch up with the tech and sports news in addition to my favourite
blogs. I honestly can't imagine life without it. I was also interested
by a recent
[article](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/google-reader-bookmarking-service/)
(prompted by the demise of delicio.us) that described the use of
Google Reader as a bookmarking service.
