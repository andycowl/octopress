[The Armstrongs](http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctwo/programmes/?id=armstrongs)
is a BBC2 fly on the wall documentary about a small, family owned double
glazing company in Coventry.

While this subject doesn't sound too inspiring, the program is
absolutely hilarious. Last week, the husband and wife owners travelled
to France in an attempt to diversify and increase dwindling sales.

Amazingly, they chose to translate their business proposition using
[Babelfish](http://babelfish.altavista.com/) which may be adequate for
children's homework but resulted in an unfortunate translation of
'conservatory' to 'music academy'. Consequently, the subtitles revealed
that couple asked their French prospects:

> 'Are there a lot of music academies in France ?'

A van driver crashed into the bosses' expensive, prized Jaguar and then
wisely chose to resign on the spot.

And we await with baited breath, the update on the young man who joined
the company and immediately asked for time off to participate in the
World Championships of Othello.
