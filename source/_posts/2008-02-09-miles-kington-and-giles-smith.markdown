Saddened to read that
[Miles Kington](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/miles-kington-polymath-wit-and-jazz-aficionado-dies-at-66-776222.html)
died recently at just 66.

I used to really enjoy Kington's columns in The Independent. There
aren't many writers capable of making laugh out loud. Kington was one of
them.

Another of my favourite journalists is Giles Smith of The Times. Last
week, he wrote a brilliant
[article](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/columnists/giles_smith/article3291900.ece)
about the appointment of Dennis Wise as 'Executive Director (football)'.

Similarly, Smith's
[piece](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/columnists/giles_smith/article3337667.ece)
in today's edition is about the proposed changes to the Premiership:

'606? I'm a City fan coming home from Nairobi and I tell you, we wuz
robbed...'
