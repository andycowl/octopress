Maybe it's just me but I have a slight unease about sitting next to a
stranger who is reading email. Obviously, I try to avert my gaze but
sometimes you can't help but read the words on the screen, no matter how
banal.

Mind you, some people might consider it slightly
[rude](http://dizwell.com/main/component/option,com_jd-wp/Itemid,109/p,136/)
to be even scanning email on a training course where the instructor is
spending time and energy trying to teach you.
