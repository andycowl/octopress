-   Durex Featherlite
-   Durex Ribbed for Extra Sensitivity
-   Durex Extra Safe
-   Durex Gossamer
-   Durex Lager & Lime
-   Durex Chicken Korma
-   Nurofen

a splitting headache'.

unnoticed in Heathrow Terminal 4 for the past 8 years, sleeping on
chairs by night and queueing in various parts of the building by day. ]
