I was convinced I had my address book quadruple-mirrored (Thunderbird,
Palm, Gmail and ScheduleWorld) secured on resilient disk storage using
RAID-5 with offsite backups.

However, when I came to start writing my Christmas cards, this
assumption proved be to false. I think something must have gone awry
during my disaster recovery testing in the summer.

Anyway, if you can remember aunties name, street name and town, you can
obtain the correct postcode from the
[Royal Mail](http://www.royalmail.com/portal/rm/postcodefinder?catId=400145).

Then, armed with the full postal address, you can (probably) obtain her
phone number from
[British Telecom](http://www.thephonebook.bt.com/publisha.content/en/find/residential/residential_numbers.publisha?com.bea.event.type=linkclick&oLName=link.searchresults&oLDesc=KB_687)
so you can thank her for the thoughtful present in January.

Finally, if you bribe a call centre employee (or root around in the bins
outside a major UK bank), you can also obtain her bank and credit card
details to find out how much she actually spent on you this year.
