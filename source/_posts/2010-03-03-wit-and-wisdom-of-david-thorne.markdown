I'm not sure if it was [Doug](http://oracledoug.com/serendipity/) or
[Michael](http://twofishcreative.com/michael/blog/) who first pointed
me towards David Thorne's [27bslash6](http://27bslash6.com) site but
his latest exchange of
[correspondence](http://twofishcreative.com/michael/blog/) with
Michael Harding of the South Austrailan police is hilarious and had me
in stitches.

I've read the article four times now and am still smiling. You can't
really quote sentences in isolation to pay justice to the brilliant
humour so just enjoy the full article. The guy is a truly brilliant
writer.
