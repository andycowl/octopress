'Holy Father. It is almost 31 years since City's last trophy. Since
then, I have:

-   Failed to install Oracle 10gR3 Grid Control to experiment with the
    Siebel Management Pack.
-   Failed to configure bridged networking on my Siebel 8.0/Oracle
    10g/RedHat VMware environment. Consequently, I have just deleted the
    complete 20GB environment in a fit of pique.
-   Nearly exploded at the woeful response to a ticket with Bluehost
    asking why two functioning cron jobs were a) removed and b) failed
    to work when reinstated.
-   Failed to resolve a trivial but incredibly annoying problem with AVG
    mail filter.
-   To top it all, I don't even know the difference between MB and Mbps.

'My dear son. You are indeed a worthless sinner. May the Lord may mercy
on your soul. To seek forgiveness and redemption, please say three Hail
Marys, one Our Father and request a transfer to pre-sales.'
