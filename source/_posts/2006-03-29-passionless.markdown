I just watched Arsenal beat Juventus 2-0 in the Champions League. I
don't support Arsenal. I don't really care whether they win or lose. I
only watched the game to kill two hours on a slow Tuesday evening in
Newcastle.

In March last year, however, I was also working away from home in
Gothenburg (near Sweden), watching a different game I passionately cared
about.

Here is the barstool correspondent's verdict on Inter Milan 1 MUFC 0.
