510 - duration in minutes of the (direct) flight from LHR to SEA

0 (zero) - number of times my immediate neighbour left his seat to
stretch his legs, visit the lavatory or chat with his friend in 37B.
Truly impressive.

6 - number of times my neighbour politely declined offers of drinks or
sustenance from the cabin crew

1029 - number of times the person behind found it necessary to delve
into the back seat pocket for his copy of 'High Life', the sick bag or
the In Flight Shopping magazine

5 - the number of times the person behind found it necessary to plunge
his fist deep and hard into the lower reaches of the back seat pocket. I
can only assume he was desperately hunting for his partially completed
Green card or putting loose change into the 'Change For Good' envelope.
At least, I fervently hope that's what he was doing. However, when you
are thoroughly enjoying, and desperately trying not to cry at,
'[Brokeback Mountain](http://imdb.com/title/tt0388795/)', any unprovoked
assault on this particular area of ones anatomy is most unwelcome.
