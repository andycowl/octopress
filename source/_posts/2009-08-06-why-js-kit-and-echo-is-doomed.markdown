title: Why JS-Kit and Echo is doomed

Yet another service in the overcrowded blog comment field is
[JS-Kit](http://js-kit.com/) who already have a conventional outsourced
blog comment capability (similar to IntenseDebate and Disqus).

JS-Kit recently
[announced](http://blog.js-kit.com/2009/07/10/comments-have-evolved-introducing-echo/)
an extension to the service called '[Echo](http://js-kit.com/echo/)'
which also includes any fleeting reference to your blog post, refreshed
in real-time from other services like Twitter, FriendFeed, Google Reader
and Facebook.

Echo isn't generally available to mere mortals yet. Yes, you guessed it
- it's limited beta, invitation only and curiously, you need a Twitter
account to even request an invitation.

However, if your name is Michael Arrington, Guy Kawasaki, Robert
[Scoble](http://scobleizer.com/2009/07/23/commenting-just-changed-for-bloggers-with-js-kit-echo/)
or Duncan
[Riley](http://www.inquisitr.com/32041/why-were-giving-js-kits-echo-a-shot/),
you are entitled to use the service which is fair enough as it works
best for high volume sites with lots of comments

However, look at this
[example](http://www.inquisitr.com/32198/twitter-sued-for-patent-infringement-and-it-doesnt-look-good/)
on The Inquistr of Echo in action on a live site.

Wow - just look at all those 'comments'. Look again closely. Most
entries are not comments at all. They are merely links or retweets to
the article from Twitter or FriendFeed. The vast majority merely echo
the main headline with no additional comment or insight.

Look again and try to find any meaningful comments where people are
actually commenting on the post and expressing their opinion. Guess
what. The vast majority are mostly classified as 'via Comments'.

So, that's three reasons, I won't be installing 'Echo' on this blog.

1.  I don't use Twitter.
2.  It adds no value.
3.  No-one ever comments anyway.
