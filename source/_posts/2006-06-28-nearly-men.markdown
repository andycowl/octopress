Poor old Spain. After their fans roundly booed the French anthem, I was
almost rooting for them to prevail over France last night. However, I
don't like Luis Aragones. I think he is an arrogant racist so I was
quite pleased that France beat them. Well, no, hang on a minute,
actually no I wasn't that pleased because I also think Thierry Henry is
an arrogant cheat.

Let's just hope Brazil beat France on Saturday.
