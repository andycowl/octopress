title: announcing Minima - an exciting, new minimalist theme for Habari

You see - I'm really wasted in IT. I really should be in pre-sales or on
'The Apprentice'.

I thought I'd return to my minimalist roots and change the theme on this
blog.

If you're reading this in an RSS reader, no need to click through and
leave a comment telling me 'I use an RSS reader so I don't care about
your new theme' because I already know.

If you think 'Hey - this theme is simply a blatant rip off of [Russell
Beattie](http://www.russellbeattie.com/blog/)'s blog, I'm going to run
and tell him', don't bother. I already know and so does Russell.
