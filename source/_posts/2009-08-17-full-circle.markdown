This humble blog is four years
[old](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2005/08/17/dot-bombs/) today so tonight
I will be taking 'Blog in isolation' and some of its closest friends to
LazerQuest (Mega Death Match Party Edition with Pizza and gallons of
Coca Cola to ensure the kids are well and truly revved up).

Everyone loves meaningful statistics so here is a pretty chart of posts
by month (for all you management types):

Curiously, since I returned from my holiday, I seem to have rediscovered
a little of my zest for blogging. Also, I have a feeling that things are
gradually turning full circle. My initial decision to dip my toe in the
water was prompted by reading and enjoying the writing of other people
and I sense that element is slowly returning. More recently, reading
blogs had turned into mindlessly hitting 'J' in Google Reader as fast as
humanly possible simply in order to say 'Done'.

Over the weekend, I spent time enjoying some

[posts](http://diamondgeezer.blogspot.com/2005_09_01_diamondgeezer_archive.html#112615864053932787)
from the dusty archives of one of my favourite UK bloggers -
[Diamond Geezer](http://diamondgeezer.blogspot.com) (pseudonym alert).
This, in
turn, (via his blogroll) led to the discovery of a handful of other
[interesting](http://www.dummies-for-destruction.co.uk/random/) and
downright
[funny](http://scaryduck.blogspot.com/2009/08/neither-mirth-nor-woe-sucker.html)
UK blogs. I have
[bemoaned](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/08/09/the-state-of-the-uk-blogosphere)
my [failure](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/11/14/top-10-uk-blogs/) to
find decent UK blogs more than once - maybe I just didn't look hard
enough or in the right places.

Before my holiday, I was experimenting once again with
[Tumblr](http://andyc.tumblr.com/) and
[Posterous](http://andyc.posterous.com/) and while these services may
have a place for a rapid fire linkblogs, scrapbooks and ready made, easy
blogs (for people who don't know or care what a blog is), I suspect that
posts I made there were simply posts I could have equally made over
here. But I was too
[lazy](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/02/08/the-art-of-lazy-consultancy/).

Blogging takes time. Blogging is difficult. Blogging is time-consuming.

Firstly, you have to think of a subject. Then you have to waste time
thinking up all the words. Then you have to login. to your blog Then you
have to actually type all the words in. Then you have to endlessly
preview and endeavour to fix all your typos and grammar. Then you have
to add an image to spice things up and break the article into logical
sections for your reader (just like the 'Blogging 101 Guide' says). Then
you have to add tags. Then you have to monitor and reply to all
comments. Then you have to publicise it.

Yes - blogging is hard. So much easier and a lot quicker to hit 'Like'
what someone else has produced.

Ironically, the well publicised
[death](http://blog.friendfeed.com/2009/08/friendfeed-accepts-facebook-friend.html)
of [FriendFeed](http://friendfeed.com/) sparked my interest and I was
briefly active again over there, providing counselling services to the
bereaved.

So, what does all of this mean for the next four years of this blog ?
God knows.
