Sadly, the world's first and most prolific blogger, the Reverend Robert
Shields has passed away in America aged 89. Shields was the author of
the world's
[longest diary](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article2767270.ece)
consisting of a staggering 37 million words.

Shields was truly the world's first blogger with his first recorded
entry in April 1927 beating Dave [Winer](http://www.scripting.com/) by 3
months. Nor was Robert Shields afraid of including trivia and useless
information in his journals. For example, how many blogs (or
[Tumblelogs](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/10/25/rowche-rumble/)
for that matter) record blood pressure readings (Shields despised silly
mood emoticons), make any effort to fastidiously record every single
visit to the lavatory (Shields had dozens of imaginative ways to
describe the act of urination) or have the thoughtfulness to detail
every single piece of junk mail ever received.

Lazy, modern bloggers (with the possible exception of Robert
[Scoble](http://scobleizer.com/) who, coincidentally, was named after
Shields) everywhere should hang their heads in shame when they learn of
Shield's commitment to the blogging cause; Shields never slept for more
than 2 hours to ensure he could capture his dreams.

Here is just one example of his exceptional writing:

> '9.35-9.40 I cleaned the cerumen from both my ears and from both
> hearing aids.'

Unfortunately, although Shields has left the 91 boxes containing his
life's work to a university, he has stipulated that the full contents
can not be published until 2049.

I will leave the final words to the great man himself.

> 'It is an uninhibited diary, It is spontaneous. I type it as it comes,
> I don't correct it and I don't edit it.'
