That's it. Enough procrastination. Finished.

I will use Microsoft
[Outlook](http://office.microsoft.com/en-gb/FX010857931033.aspx) to
manage my email, contacts, tasks and calendar at work.

I will store work related and personal data in the same repository.

I will not store any data on a Web based service.

I will use [Beyond
Contacts](http://www.dataviz.com/products/beyondcontacts/index.html)
(from [DataViz](http://www.dataviz.com/)) to synchronise my contacts,
tasks and calendar to my aging but perfectly adequate monochrome [Palm
Vx](http://euro.palm.com/uk/en/products/palmvx/index.html).

I will either use old fashioned paper and cheap biros from leading hotel
chains (I would only lose an expensive
[moleskin](http://www.moleskine.co.uk/) and fountain
[pen](http://www.cityorg-pdq.co.uk/acatalog/Montblanc_Fountain_Pens.html))
or the Palm to capture stuff when I am at home, in transit, in a
hostelry or away from my work computer.

I may also send emails to myself from my home computer to work.

I will manually manage my address book on my Nokia phone. This is more
work for me but absolutely necessary because I dislike the Nokia [PC
Suite](http://www.nokiausa.com/support/pcsuite/main.html) program so
intensely.

I will capture my personal finances in [Microsoft
Money](http://www.microsoft.com/uk/homepc/money/default.mspx).

I will continue to use [TiddlyWiki](http://www.tiddlywiki.com/) (in
preference to
[OneNote](http://office.microsoft.com/en-gb/FX010858031033.aspx) and
[EverNote](http://www.evernote.com/en/)) to capture personal notes,
jottings and information mainly because I like the sound of 'reusable
non-linear personal web notebook' and it fits on a memory stick.

I will continue to keep [Joomla](http://www.joomla.org/) in my thoughts.

I will no longer mock my wife for keeping lots of lists; 'The only thing
you need now is a list telling you where all your lists are'.
