There's a common saying in Customer Relationship Management (CRM)
circles along the lines of:

> It takes 10,000 times more time/money/effort to acquire a new customer
> than it takes to retain an existing customer.

Evidence of this is commonplace; introductory offers, improved interest
rates, free Parker pen and pencil gift set and enticements for new
customers for which existing customers are ineligible.

Now I occasionally claim that I am writing this blog purely for me,
myself and I. What I mean by that is that I tend to write what I want
when I want and don't feel pressured to produce content on a regular
ongoing basis. However, that's not entirely true; if it was I could
equally well write this stream of consciousness into a A5 notebook
locked in my top drawer where no-one would ever see it.

Let's be honest - people are blogging to get noticed and everyone
likes feedback (even if it's negative feedback) and it's fantastic if,
just occasionally, someone says 'God - that post about LinkedIn and
pole dancing made me laugh'.

A recent
[comment](http://nbrightside.com/blog/2006/06/21/the-curious-case-of-the-missing-about-page#comment-113403409)
by Bill (which I will reproduce here) rather took me by surprise and
made me pause for thought

> I like your blog, but just one thing about it frustrates me - you
> “tag” posts, but I can't seem to find an index of these tags. (?) For
> example, I like to read your comments on emacs - but without such an
> index, I am forced to use Google to search your site.

Now here was a potential customer (an interested like-minded reader or
even hopefully, that rare animal, a brand new subscriber) for my
business (my humble blog) and what was I doing to welcome him, to
encourage him, to help him find his way around my blog ? Nothing.
Absolutely nothing.

After giving this some thought, I decided to take prompt and decisive
action:

> Many thanks for popping by and bothering to leave some constructive
> criticism about the lack of decent navigation options on this blog.
> There's a couple of reasons for this:
>
> 1.  I recently moved this blog to Drupal 7 and I didn't actually know
>     how to add tag clouds, archive pages, previous/next post, related
>     posts or search functionality.
>
> 2.  In the past, I have played with all of the above on both WordPress
>     and Habari in an effort to keep casual readers lingering for
>     longer and my gut feeling was that none of these additions made a
>     blind bit of difference to Pages/Visit and merely cluttered up the
>     blog.
>
> However, prompted by your comment, I have now added 'Tags' together
> with a search box on the sidebar and an 'Archives' tab allowing you to
> browse by year or month.

Unfortunately, I never heard from the mysterious Bill ever again. A
cautionary tale and a valuable lesson in CRM for all small-time
bloggers.
