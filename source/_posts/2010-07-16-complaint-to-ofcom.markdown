Last night, Sky News played audio footage of Raoul Moat's last moments.
This included detailed analysis of the sounds by an expert of the three
‘gunshots' and some idle chit-chat about whether someone was screaming
‘Aaarrgh - my arm' (Moat) or ‘Get the firearm' (police officers).

No matter what Moat was or what he had done, that was simply a step too
far and unacceptable in my opinion.

This broadcast was not in the public interest and breached the standards
of normal, common decency.

The media should not have been allowed within 2 miles of the standoff
with police, let alone allowed to film and record the final moments of a
man's life.
