The forthcoming release of WordPress 2.5 was one reason I was hesitant
to move to Habari.

However, having seen a
[demo](http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2008/02/14/wordpress-25-demo-site/)
of the revised dashboard in WordPress 2.5, all I can say is I am glad I
made the move and didn't wait.

While I am merely an end user (not a UI designer), Michael Heilemann
articulates many of my views on the deficiences and
usability[](http://binarybonsai.com/archives/2008/02/10/interface-screencast-1-the-wordpress-dashboard/)
of the Wordpress dashboard in this detailed
[analysis](http://binarybonsai.com/archives/2008/02/10/interface-screencast-1-the-wordpress-dashboard/).

Michael also
[dissects](http://binarybonsai.com/archives/2008/02/12/interface-screencast-2-the-wordpress-23-write-page/)
the design of the WordPress 'Write Page' screen. The 'Write Page' is
probably the most important one for the blog author as that's where he
spends most of his time. I agree with Michael - the page is cluttered
with unnecessary distractions

Compare the WordPress page with the 'blank canvas' presented by the
article editor in Habari.
