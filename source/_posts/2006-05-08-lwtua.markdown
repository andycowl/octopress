I happened to be in Macclesfield at the weekend and went over to the
Crematorium to see Ian Curtis' plaque.

I was never fortunate enough to ever see Joy Division live but I vividly
remember returning from a United game and watching them perform
'[Transmission](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-1314915584940560089&q=Joy+Division)'
and '[She's Lost Control](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=3810783091155128454&q=%22Joy+Division%22)'
on a local TV program 'Something Else'.

Ian Curtis was a very ill man and hanged himself on the eve of a US tour.

His wife, Deborah, wrote a very interesting
[book](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0571224814/qid=1147081346/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl/202-2505147-5837430)
about their life that describes him very differently from the tragic,
angst ridden hero portrayed in the media.

One myth claimed that Ian Curtis committed suicide, standing on a block
of ice but this is completely untrue.
