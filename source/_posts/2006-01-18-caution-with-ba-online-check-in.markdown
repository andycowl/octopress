You can save lots of time and get even more things done by checking in
online for your flight at
[www.britishairways.com](http://www.britishairways.com/).

You can even change your allocated seat (sometimes) which is useful as
BA will always allocate an aisle seat if your preference is window and
vice-versa. Version 2.0 of the BA site (June 2006) will even include a
brief description of your prospective neighbour in order to help you
with this difficult choice.

You can also print out your boarding card on your 12 year old dot matrix
printer. This means you can skip the short queue at the BA self service
kiosks and immediately proceed to the lengthy queue for the curiously
misnamed 'Fast Bag Drop'.

However, a word of caution to all you GTD'ers. Wait for the printout to
fully emerge and carefully check the output before leaving the BA web
site. Secondly, always, always click the 'Click here to print boarding
card' icon to avoid potential embarassment.

Do not be tempted to think that because you work in IT, you know better
and it will be far quicker to simply right-click 'Print This Page' to
save another 2.4 milliseconds in an effort to get things done.

Trust me. I did it and because I don't know what a 'frame' is, I found
myself presenting a rather unusual boarding pass at the British Airways
desk that simply said:
> "Click the 'Print Boarding Pass' button (you idiot) to print"
