Thoroughly enjoying '[Margave of the
Marshes](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/09/07/margrave-of-the-marshes/)'
and pleased to see [The
Chameleons](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/01/10/in-praise-of-mark-burgess/)
get a mention:

> For David Fielding of The Chameleons, that meant loitering outside
> Broadcasting House in order to press their tape directly into John's
> paw.
> In the case of The Chameleons, John thought he was the victim of a
> practical joke after listening to their demo: the recording was so
> accomplished that he suspected he had been given a cassette of an
> established band.

...although this slightly contradicts the
[note](http://www.thechameleons.com/press/index.php?type=Photos&PhotoID=1)
that John Peel sent back to the band where Peel describes the tape as
'Very muffled'.

A few years, when Mark Burgess got married, I made a paltry contribution
to a wedding present. A few weeks later, I was staggered to receive an
email from Mark Burgess thanking me together with a draft chapter of his
(still unpublished) autobiography. Mark also describes travelling down
to London and hanging around outside Broadcasting House with a tape.
