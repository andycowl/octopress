I have to say I am a little surprised at this breaking
[news](http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/man_city/7372872.stm).
Still, I guess
[Eriksson](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/07/03/the-wit-and-wisdom-of-sven-goran-eriksson/)
will draw another excessive compensation package while he seeks
alternative employment.

In my view, buying all those expensive foreigners, beating United twice
and finishing mid-table was a creditable first season.

Mind you, I always had niggling reservations about Mr.
[Shinawatra](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/06/22/theatre-of-comedy).

So, who's next for the job at Manchester City - Jose Mourinho ?
