I currently pay &pound;92 per month to Virgin Media:

- Telephone Rental - &pound;5.50
- Talk Evenings/Weekends - &pound;11
- Digital TV (L) - &pound;11.50
- Broadband (4MB) - &pound;25
- Additional Set Top Box - &pound;15
- Sky Sports 1/2/3 - &pound;24

I just called Customer Retentions on 0800 0730591 (not 150) to try to
renegotiate my package after the recent loss of Sky One. It took a while
(15 mins) to get through on the Freephone number but it was worth it.

Without much pushing, the gentleman kindly summarised Wednesday night's
episode of
'[Lost](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/03/02/lost-without-lost/)'
and then offered me:

- Upgrade to 10MB broadband
- Upgrade to VIP package
  ([XL](http://allyours.virginmedia.com/websales/product.do?id=21) TV
  and free movies)
- Free [V+](http://allyours.virginmedia.com/html/dtv/vplus/index.html)
  box
- Price reduction to &pound;85 per month

As my mum used to say, 'If you don't ask, you don't get.'
