After two months and two days, the music has stopped, the theme
[rotation](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/06/02/rotation-policy/)
carousel has travelled full circle and finally come to a halt.

WordPress.com offers a total of 40 themes (37 when I started) and I have
experimented and laboriously captured screenshots of every single one.

I have tried out all the WP themes as they became available but it was
interesting to live with each theme for a day or so.

My personal favourites were:

> [Andreas04](http://www.flickr.com/photos/70276096@N00/162240611/in/set-72157594157259315/)

> [Light](http://www.flickr.com/photos/70276096@N00/188615063/in/set-72157594157259315/)
> - simple, effective theme. If only it was a little wider.
>
> [Regulus](http://flickr.com/photos/70276096@N00/261113070/) - still

> [Rubric](http://www.flickr.com/photos/70276096@N00/183160220/in/set-72157594157259315/)
> - great looking theme with focus on the text but I feel
> [Lorelle](http://lorelle.wordpress.com/) has made this theme her own.

> [Sandbox](http://www.flickr.com/photos/70276096@N00/206524350/in/set-72157594157259315/)
> - a building block for DIY enthusiasts.

> [White As Milk](http://www.flickr.com/photos/70276096@N00/202237366/in/set-72157594157259315/)
> - clean, minimalist look but narrow text.

And my hall of shame:

> [Banana Smoothie](http://www.flickr.com/photos/70276096@N00/163570474/in/set-72157594157259315/)
> - not for everyone but undeniably very distinctive.
> [Flower Power](http://www.flickr.com/photos/70276096@N00/170564221/in/set-72157594157259315/)
> - not sure why this theme only uses half the screen.
>
> [Sweet Blossoms](http://www.flickr.com/photos/70276096@N00/194227376/in/set-72157594157259315/)
> - too much colour, not enough screen.

I guess my perfect theme would be a two column, minimalist theme with an
emphasis on the article text. In fact, Scott's Wallick's
[plaintxt](http://www.plaintxt.org/themes/veryplaintxt/) theme is pretty
close to perfection.

I guess I always could shell out 15 USD and build it myself on WordPress
using the recently launched
[custom CSS](http://wordpress.com/blog/2006/08/04/custom-css/).

Alternatively, I could just pay up and get my own hosted WordPress blog
with complete control over everything.

So, review the Flickr
