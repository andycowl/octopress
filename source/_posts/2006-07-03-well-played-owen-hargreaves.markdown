One of the few England players who can hold his head up high after this
World Cup.

He silenced the doubters (myself included) with two immense performances
in midfield.

Oh and he converted a kick from 12 yards with just a goalkeeper to beat.
Very unusual and very un-English behaviour. It must be the Canadian
blood and the fact he plays his domestic football in Germany.
