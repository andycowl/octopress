Chatting with a good friend over dinner last night, he recounted how
his son ambushed him late one Sunday night with some economics
homework that he'd somehow manage to overlook and which simply had to
be submitted the following morning.

Annoyed, and after dispensing a severe bollocking, he reluctantly sat
down and gave his son some lengthy help with the complex and thorny
topic of

> 'How does monetary policy affect the economy ?'

A week later, his son mumbled 'Oh yeah - I got that Eco essay back
today and got a 'C' for it'.

My friend has a first class honours degree in Economics from the
University of Warwick, has spent 26 years working in finance and
banking and is currently a senior economic analyst for the leading
fund manager, Gartmore.

My - how we laughed.
