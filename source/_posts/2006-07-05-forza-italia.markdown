Congratulations to Italy. They deserved to win as they scored two
sublime goals and played the game to the bitter end in the right spirit
and style.

Why - I haven't seen so many Germans lying on the turf in crumpled,
disconsolate heaps since Barcelona in May 1999.

At times, the
[BBC](http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/worldcup/2006/07/why_i_want_germany_to_win_the.html)
made me feel I was the only person in England not supporting our new
best friends, Germany.

Still, if I had just enjoyed a 6 weeks, all expenses paid holiday in
Germany, enjoying the hospitality watching all the World Cup games, I
would probably feel the same.

As for France versus Portugal, that's a tricky one. I can't decide who I
want to miss the decisive penalty more - Onnn-Reeee or Ronaldo.
