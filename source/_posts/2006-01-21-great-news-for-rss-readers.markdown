[GreatNews](http://www.curiostudio.com/), in fact. I just discovered
this RSS reader which is a Windows desktop RSS reader but can
synchronise with Bloglines for Web based access.

GreatNews is fast, has a clean logical interface, with an integrated
browser, highly configurable (2 or 3 pane display), supports newspaper
style for reading groups, drag'n'drop for organising folders, auto feed
discovery and perhaps most importantly, displays as much content as
possible (no ads), enabling you to quickly focus on what is of interest.

You can't display the feeds into your preferred order but there is a
'Most Visited' view which amounts to the same thing.

So, I have exported all my feeds from Newsgator and will be trying out
GreatNews as my RSS reader now.
