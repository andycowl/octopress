Occasionally, I used to wonder what people thought when they were
subjected to some of the material on this blog.
[Andrew Sherman](http://andrewsherman.blogspot.com/)'s
[comment](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/01/14/two-one-way-tickets-to-dublin-please/#comment-30737)
questioning whether this
[story](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/01/14/two-one-way-tickets-to-dublin-please/)
was completely true also resurrected this thought.

Most of the articles, posts, stories on this blog are based on truth.
The vast majority are anecdotes recounting real-life events that
actually happened to me, that my warped sense of humour finds amusing.
Examples in this category:

-   [Axe Murderer](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/04/04/axe-murderer/)
-   [Narrow Escape](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/03/21/a-narrow-escape/)
-   [Hamsters etc](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/11/08/hamsters-headhunters-hampers-and-false-religion/)
-   [Eat Your Own Dog Food](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/12/05/eat-your-own-dog-food/)
-   [Trick Or Treat](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/11/01/trick-or-treat/)
-   [Smoke and Mirrors](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/07/20/smoke-and-mirrors/)
-   Anything titled [YCNMIU](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/11/23/ycnmiu-4/)

Other posts are simultaneously technical and non-technical but merely an
opportunity for a superb, ambiguous title.

-   [Packet Sniffer](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/09/13/packet-sniffer/)

Another category of posts are almost completely true but embellished, to
a greater or lesser degree for comic effect, normally for the
punchline/conclusion:

-   [Holiday Highlights](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/08/22/holiday-highlights/)
    [I lost my footing but didn't actually fall out of the boat]
-   [Embarassing Purchase](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/03/27/probably-the-most-embarassing-purchase-in-the-world/)
    [I didn't really give my mum Durex for Mother's Day]
-   [Speech Day](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/07/13/speech-day/)
-   [Do What You Are Told](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/07/06/just-do-what-you-are-told-2/)
-   [In Flight Statistics](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/05/15/in-flight-statistics/)
-   [Homework Excuse](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/06/05/novel-homework-excuse/)
-   [Innocence of Youth](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/04/01/the-innocence-of-youth-2/)

Sometimes I massage thoughts and ideas that would be too boring for a
conventional blog entry. Imagine the tedium of a blog entry that reads
'I really enjoy the BBC series:
[Dragon's Den](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/09/16/dragons-den/)
- do you ?'

A relatively small number are (obviously) complete, drug and drink
induced, fiction. Normally characterised by silly names.

-   [Book Club](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/11/28/testing-debut-at-book-club/)
-   [Power Dressing](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/12/19/power-dressing-in-reverse/)
-   [Iris](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/10/03/stood-up-by-iris/)
-   [ETL](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/02/20/introduction-to-etl-for-oracle/)

Single, weak attempt at satire. I always wanted to write for Private
Eye.

-   [World Cup Diary](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/07/06/wayne-rooneys-world-cup-diary/)

The biggest compliment anyone has ever paid me was when
[Doug Burns](http://oracledoug.com/serendipity) commented 'You refuse
to sign-post things'. In fact, this was merely an observation on my
blogging style but I took it as a compliment. In fact, I was so struck
by this that I immediately put up a sign-post with this very quote
above my desk.

You don't need smiley faces dotted everywhere telling you where to smile
or laugh inwardly.

You don't need to understand all of the lyrics.

You need to be left thinking 'What on earth was that all about ?'
