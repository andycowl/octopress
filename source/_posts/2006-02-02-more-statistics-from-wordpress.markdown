Just noticed that those nice people at Wordpress.com have added
aggregated statistics over 7 and 30 days.

A software company that actually listens to their users and '[eats their
own dog food](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eat_one's_own_dog_food)'.
Interesting concept but I don't think it will ever take off.
