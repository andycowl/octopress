One of the
[candidates](http://www.bbc.co.uk/apprentice/candidates/mani.shtml) on
BBC2's ['The Apprentice'](http://www.bbc.co.uk/apprentice/) is a
'management consultant'. He was very keen and virtually begged to be
allowed to do the sales pitch on this week's show.

> 'Please, let me do the pitch. This is what I do. I am world class.
> There is no-one better.'

And then, in his sharp suit and with his short haircut, he opened his
stilted, stuttering, unrehearsed, nerve-ridden pitch to various hard
nosed businessmen (about a charity calendar for Great Ormond Street
Hospital) with the immortal words.

> 'Now, please, forgive me if I get a little emotional...'

And all over Britain, the viewing audience cringed with the exception of
management consultants everywhere, who exclaimed:

> 'Oh my God. This guy is simply appalling. I could do so much better.
> He's not even using Powerpoint. And another thing, just look at that
> tie.'
