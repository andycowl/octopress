British Airways are taking
[steps](http://management.silicon.com/itdirector/0,39024673,39157435,00.htm)
to move the queues from the conventional check-in desks on UK domestic
flights to queues at the self-service kiosks and even lengthier queues
at the 'Fast Bag Drop' desk which will be renamed 'Bag Drop' to comply
with the Trades Description Act.

This is good news and it will be interesting to see the effects but
please take

when printing your board pass.
