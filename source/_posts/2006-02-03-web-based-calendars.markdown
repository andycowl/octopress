I have been thinking (yes I do a lot of that) recently about managing my
personal calendar more effectively. Ideally, I would like a simple Web
based calendar that could also sync to my Palm.

I don't really like the Yahoo! [Calendar](http://calendar.yahoo.com/)
that much even though it can sync with Outlook and the Palm. I simply
don't enjoy looking at the Yahoo! calendar. I just think the interface
is ugly and there are distracting ads liberally scattered at the top of
the screen.

I am following the development of
[Sunbird](http://www.mozilla.org/projects/calendar/sunbird.html) with
interest but this project is still in development and I think Sunbird
only runs locally.

I have an outstanding, low priority ToDo to evaluate [Remember The
Milk](http://www.rememberthemilk.com/) but keep forgetting.

So, I was interested to read [Matt Mullenweg](http://photomatt.net/)
speaking in glowing [terms](http://photomatt.net/2006/02/02/30-boxes/)
about the calendar functionality from [30
Boxes](http://www.30boxes.com/) rapidly followed by similar sentiments
from
[Scobleizer](http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/2006/02/03/calendaring-heats-up).

Mental note. Forego 'Songs of Praise' for just one week and remember to
sign up at [30 Boxes](http://www.30boxes.com/) on Sunday 5 February when
it enters public beta.

In fact, add it to your calendar with an SMS alert so you don't forget.
