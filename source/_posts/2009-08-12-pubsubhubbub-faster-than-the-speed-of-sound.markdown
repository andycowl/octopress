There's been a lot of chatter recently about Feedburner's support for
the
[PubSubHubbub](http://adsenseforfeeds.blogspot.com/2009/07/whats-all-hubbub-about-pubsubhubbub.html)
protocol.

Apparently, it means that blog posts show up much quicker in FriendFeed,
Google Reader and other services. I must admit I was fairly sceptical as
my posts still take a couple of hours to appear.

However, I was wrong (again). Look at this recent example. The post
showed up a full three and a half hours on Google Reader before I
published it.

Apparently, the next release will read your mind, type the words in,
link to relevant pictures and publish your blog entries automatically.
It's called the 'real-time Web'.
