'Would you like any cashback today at all, Sir ?'

'Oh yeah. That would be handy. &pound;50 - thanks.'

'Oh I'm awfully sorry. I haven't got enough money in the till to give
you &pound;50, Sir.'

'Oh OK - how about &pound;30 then ?'

[Looks dolefully into depths of till] 'Hmm - not really. That would
leave me a little short of cash.'

'Can you manage &pound;20 ?'

'Yeah, yeah.  &pound;20. I can give you &pound;20.'

'OK great. I'll take twenty then. Thanks.'

[Rummages in depths of till and brandishes two 10 pound notes which he
then withholds by holding them out of my reach] - '...but it really
would help me if you could just take &pound;10.'

'Oh - wait. No problem. It really doesn't matter. Sorry to mess you
about. I'll just go to the cashpoint outside to get some money. It's
fine. Please, forget I ever mentioned cashback.'

Then, as I walked home, I remembered it wasn't me that broached the
prospect of 'cashback' at all - it was him.
