The WordPress rich text editor is pretty good but has an odd bug which
is a little irritating. It keeps confusing paragraph end with line break

I tried [Writely](http://www.writely.com/) which worked but has no
support for adding categories, omits the title and uses an obscure post
slug so now I am trying
[Performancing for Firefox](http://performancing.com/firefox)
which has none of these limitations and works fine.
