I was going to spend Saturday compiling very important
[guidelines](http://www.dizwell.com/prod/node/805) for the formatting,
style and content of comments but decided to go and watch the Ladies
final and Men's semi-finals at the 
[Surbiton Trophy](http://surbiton.lta.org.uk/) instead.

I packed a lovely picnic (much to the envy of my neighbours), took a
proper [camera](http://picasaweb.google.com/nbrightside/SurbitonTrophy)
and enjoyed three matches in the sun:

- Brenda Schultz McCarthy (36 years old, 6 foot tall) beat Ayumi
  Morita (17 years old, 5 foot tall) in three entertaining sets.
- The eventual winner, Frenchman Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, edged out the
  Australian 4th seed in a tight match featuring many impressive aces.
- Dodged for cover as 6'10" Croatian, Ivo Karlovic, smashed his way
  past a bewildered American, Robbie Kendrick (whose lovely girlfriend
  was sitting next to me).
