Everything was in its
[place](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/02/27/full-circle/). Then I
went and changed
[everything](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/03/08/thunderbirds-are-go/)
(again). My therapist says this is a character defect and a sign of
subliminal procrastination.

Hard reset Palm Pilot. Download Thunderbird
[extension](http://kb.mozillazine.org/Talk:PalmSync_(Thunderbird)) to
sync address book. Doesn't work.

So now my Contacts are in Thunderbird (periodic manual export/import)
and I am using the Palm for Calendar and Tasks. If it's good enough for
Dave Allen, then it's good enough for me.

Next Action: Wait for Thunderbird/Sunbird to fully support Palm
synchronisation.
