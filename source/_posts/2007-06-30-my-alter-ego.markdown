During the week I am a boring IT consultant.

However, at weekends, I transform into a massive, dance, trance, garage,
hop-hip, mixmaster DJ, spinning vinyl, entertaining the masses at
[Glastonbury](http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=W9d37nKWUeE&mode=related&search=).

No wonder I'm so tired every Monday morning.
