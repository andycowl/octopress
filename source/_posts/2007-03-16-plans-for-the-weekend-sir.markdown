What could possibly be better than a romantic city break in Amsterdam
with your loved one in the glorious spring sunshine ?

That would be lovely but, unfortunately, Norma has chosen to take her
loved one, Norma- Jean to Holland to indulge in culture, canals, Anne
Frank, trampolining, tulips and space-cake.

Never mind. What could possibly be better than a lazy weekend dedicated
to father-son bonding ? A chance to catch up in the beer garden on all
the events of the week at work and school respectively. A chance to hire
'Borat' on DVD and laugh helplessly.

A chance to order pizza with garlic bread instead of defrosting that
meal in the freezer. A chance to go to bed whenever we damn well please.
A chance to play music loud. A chance for father and son to go to see a
real football match, err, well Charlton v Newcastle.

That would be lovely but, unfortunately, Norman Junior III has foolishly
spurned this glorious opportunity in favour of a 'sleepover' followed by
paint-balling with his real mates.

Oh well. What could be better than a night in the pub followed by a
curry with your mates ?

Nothing.
