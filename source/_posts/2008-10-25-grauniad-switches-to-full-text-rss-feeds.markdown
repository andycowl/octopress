18 months ago, I
[reviewed](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/02/27/uk-broadsheets-narrow-view-of-syndication/)
the online editions of the leading UK newspapers and the various
syndication options.

At that time, all the newspapers only offered partial text feeds which,
in my opinion, is understandable but
[unsatisfactory](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/05/26/partial-versus-full-fe/).

So I was pleasantly surprised to read in
[ReadWriteWeb](http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/the_guardian_full_text_rss.php)
that The Guardian has broken ranks and now
[offers](http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/insideguardian/2008/oct/22/full-fat-rss-feed-upgrade)
full text RSS feeds. It will be interesting to see whether this
increases subscribers for The Guardian and whether the competition will
be persuaded to follow suit.
