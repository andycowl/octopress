Djibril Cisse (tattooed neck, ridiculous shaved head) celebrating his
superb, individual, match winning goal (err, well, a converted penalty)
in front of the Gallowgate End at St James Park by removing his shirt to
remove a grubby white vest declaring his undying love for his wife, his
cat, God, Robbie Fowler, his late gerbil and dearly departed Lady Diana,
Queen of Our Hearts.

After all, I mean, his last goal was last year (28 December 2005) so
that vest must absolutely stink.
