Virgin Media email has been
[down](http://status-cable.virginmedia.com/vmstatus/serviceissue.do?ticket=1066470)
for 48 hours and counting...

I am not looking forward to explaining this (again) to Norma tonight.
She seems to hold me personally responsible and keeps asking 'What is
wrong, why haven't they got in touch, why is it taking so long to fix it
and when is it going to be fixed ?'

This is a complete CRM disaster from Virgin Media. No meaningful updates
in over 2 days.

Can you imagine the fuss in the blogosphere if Gmail was down for just a
couple of hours ?
