There's nowt as queer as folk. I could maintain a blog purely on search
terms leading to this dark recess of the blogsphere.

For example:
'[Urinals](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/05/11/standing-at-the-urinals/)
With a View at Stockholm Airport'

Worryingly,
[Stockholm](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/03/22/stockholm-a-word-of-warning/)
is precisely where I am heading next week. Thankfully this time, I will
be leaving the confines of the airport
[complex](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/04/10/flying-visit/). I
think I will abstain from all fluid intake prior to the flight, cross my
legs and wait until I get to the hotel.

Not to mention this rather odd blog
[entry](http://hersheysiniceincream.blogspot.com/2006/06/recently-i-give-rise-to-website.html)
which the author claims I have inspired in some way.
