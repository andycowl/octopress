Next week, I am bound for the wonderful city of
[Copenhagen](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/04/25/wonderful-wonderful-copenhagen/),
near Denmark. I normally aim to stay in a hotel close to the client
offices. If my commute can be done on foot, I am absolutely delighted.

However, on this one occasion, I have elected to stay on the other side
of town which, unfortunately, will mean a very long
[taxi ride](http://ocaoimh.ie/2007/01/31/topless-speed-bandits-cause-traffic-pile-up/)
over a congested bridge, to cross the city in rush-hour. Once in the
morning and again in the afternoon.
