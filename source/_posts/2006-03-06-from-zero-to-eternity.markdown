Thanks to [Jeff Hunter](http://marist89.blogspot.com/) kindly updating
the link on his blogroll, this blog has awoken from a period of slumber.
> Day 201. Technorati Rank: 187,013 (28 links from 15 sites)

Don't ask me why 3 links and 3 sites have been added (instead of 1)
since the last update. Who am I to question the inner workings of
[Technorati](http://technorati.com/) ?
However, [/Message](http://www.stoweboyd.com/message/) is currently
positioned at an impressive 4,586 (514 links from 269 sites) and [Stowe
Boyd](http://www.stoweboyd.com/message/)'s beaming face and black beret
continue to taunt me so the struggle must go on.
