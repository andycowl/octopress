I am not overly surprised the Al Qaeda training camp in Afghanistan
educates people about how to assemble explosive devices and avoid
detection by security forces in addition to tips on identifying soft
targets. The hands-on lab exercises (days 4-5) will undoubtedly assist
with providing riveting content for suicide notes and how to get the
soft lighting right for your exit video.

All of this hard work will be ultimately worthwhile because there is the
promise of eternal martyrdom and 99 vestal virgins dressed in white
lingerie. The highly prestigious Terrorist Certificated Professional
(TCP) qualification will also be presented to all successful candidates
on completion of the course.

However, I am a little surprised the terrorist training course also
includes 'How to negotiate a discount for bulk purchases of [hydrogen
peroxide](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-2555956.html).'

Turning your back, as you prepare to meet your maker and detonate your
device, to face a mother with a baby in a push-chair is pretty mean
hearted too.

In most civilised countries, a mob would have pursued and savagely
attacked the fleeing bombers. In London, a middle-aged lady said 'Excuse
me. You appear to have dropped something out of your rucksack' and held
up a 6 inch nail and ball bearing.
