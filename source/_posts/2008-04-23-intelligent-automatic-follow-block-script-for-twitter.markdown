London, near England - 23 April 2008. For immediate release.

Brightside Software Enterprises are pleased to announce the immediate
availability of 'FriendOrFoe'.

Tired of being followed by those mindless idiots on Twitter, not to
mention those horrid spammers ?

Tired of having to search out new friends with similar interests, sense
of humour and outlook ?

Tired of being a 'soul in isolation' with 0 (zero) friends in the whole
wide world ?

'FriendOrFoe' is a simple Twitter utility that will subject all Twitter
'Follow' requests to lengthy and vigorous inspection using sophisticated
algorithms, advanced AI techniques together with analysis of 'social
graphs' to categorise the prospective follower as:

-   Spammer (Citeh or Liverpool fan filters available soon) - user will
    be automatically blocked and receive a DM stating 'Don't follow me,
    follow Jesus'.
-   Friend - automatically follow back, sending a DM to the recipient's
    mobile, changing the ring-tone to U2's 'I will follow'.
-   Stalker - automatically followed on Twitter, FriendFeed, Ponce,
    Jaiku, NetVibes and footage of user streamed on live Webcam, right
    into your bedsit.
-   Anyone, anytime, anywhere (aka 'Promiscuous mode') - all Follow
    requests are blindly followed with a DM of 'Hey I'm pretty
    desperate. Fancy a drink ?'

'FriendOrFoe' is freely available now as a set of Greasy scripts written
by 1,000 monkeys, bashing away continuously for 8 days, on a Dvorak
keyboard.
