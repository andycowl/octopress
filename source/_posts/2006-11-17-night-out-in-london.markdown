Last night, I enjoyed a pleasant evening in this
[pub](http://www.beerintheevening.com/pubs/s/26/2611/Sun_Tavern/Covent_Garden)
with a few friends. We watched a mediocre team in white draw with a
mediocre team in orange and blue socks.

Beer arrived on a regular basis from the downstairs bar via the dumb
waiter.

Inexplicably, towards the end of the evening, conversation turned to
songs about the death of a father:-

- The Verve - Drugs Don't Work
- The Streets - Never Went To Church
- Mike And The Mechanics - The Living Years
- U2 - Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own
- Billy Bragg - Tank Park Salute

We finally left the pub and someone asked 'What are the chances of
finding a curry house around here ?'. We looked across the street and
our prayers were

This beautiful

deserted station concourse captures an unusual sense of peaceful
isolation and a rare moment of tranquility at London Waterloo.

Yes. I missed the last train for the sake of a large bottle of Cobra but
it was worth it.
