'Who is the SQL Server DBA ?'

'I am'

'Who is the Siebel Administrator ?'

'Err, me'

'Who is the keeper of DNS ?'

'I am'

'Do you want a screenshot of that ?'

'No. I am only noting down areas where we diverge from the default OOTB
configuration.'

'Who do we ask about adding entries to the Active Directory ?'

'Him'

'Who is the Web meister ?'

'Me'

And so, when working with such intelligent people (Jack of All Trades),
it is entirely possible to install, patch and demonstrate the features
of a highly available, resilient Siebel 7.8 Enterprise, within one day,
featuring:-

> Two Web Servers (IIS 6.0) load balanced by Cisco CSS
> Active-Active MSCS cluster (Gateway, EIM, Workflow, Assignment
> Manager, Data Quality)
>
> Two Siebel Servers (Object Manager) using native load balancing
>
> Clustered SQL Server database

A thoroughly satisfying and productive day with plenty of intelligent,
probing questions from technical people eager to learn and willing to
read
[books](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/06/13/helping-people-read-books/).

A day that should have ended in handshakes all round, a premature end to
the engagement, a glowing testimonial from the customer about yours
truly to their account manager that he, in turn, forwarded to my
manager.

But no. This customer now wants to deploy SSL, authenticate using Active
Directory and would like to see how Single Sign On (SSO) could help the
business.
