Had a drink in [The
Plough](http://www.pub-explorer.com/herts/pub/ploughleverstockgreen.htm)
in [Hemel
Hempstead](http://streetmap.co.uk/newmap.srf?x=507936&y=207021&z=2&sv=507936,207021&st=4&mapp=newmap.srf&searchp=newsearch.srf&ax=507936&ay=207021)
last night.

Conveniently located for the
[Buncefield](http://www.bbc.co.uk/threecounties/content/image_galleries/buncefield_gallery_two_gallery.shtml?11)
Oil Refinery, The Plough offers fine ales and traditional English fare.

Bad news: Guinness was off.

Good news. Bitter and lager looked and tasted just like Guinness

Food: Sausages and mash with black pudding. Gravy was greasy, a little
oily in fact.
