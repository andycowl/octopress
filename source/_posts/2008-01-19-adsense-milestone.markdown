It is just over six months since I first
[placed](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/05/23/sit-back-and-watch-the-money-roll-in/)
banner ads on this blog and, much to my surprise, the accumulated income
has just reached $100 (which triggers the first payment from Google).

As the introduction of [Adsense](https://www.google.com/adsense/) was
purely an exercise to learn how the system works and experiment with
different placements and formats, I have decided to donate all proceeds
to a worthy [charity](http://www.mssociety.org.uk/).
