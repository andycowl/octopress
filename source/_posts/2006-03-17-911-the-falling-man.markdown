A Channel 4 documentary about [9/11][] and the controversial photographs
capturing the fi nal seconds of people who jumped to their deaths.

Harrowing and yet compulsive viewing. Not for everyone and the sort of
program y ou might expect a warning about the content (21:00-22:30)
which some may find di sturbing, upsetting or offensive.

Instead, Channel 4 announce ‘This program contains images and video
footage featuring repetitive patterns that may cause problems for people
with photosensitive epilepsy’. Bizarre. Truly bizarre.

May the 2,967 innocent people who lost their lives that day rest in peace.
