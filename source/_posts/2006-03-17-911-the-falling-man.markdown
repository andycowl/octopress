A Channel 4 documentary about <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2092-2069640,00.html">9/11</a> and the controversial photographs capturing the final seconds of people who jumped to their deaths.

Harrowing and yet compulsive viewing. Not for everyone and the sort of program you might expect a warning about the content (21:00-22:30) which some may find disturbing, upsetting or offensive.

Instead, Channel 4 announce 'This program contains images and video footage featuring repetitive patterns that may cause problems for people with photosensitive epilepsy'. Bizarre. Truly bizarre.

May the 2,967 innocent people who lost their lives that day rest in peace.
