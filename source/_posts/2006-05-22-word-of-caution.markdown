I used to politely spurn all invitations to join
[LinkedIn.com](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/03/03/linkedincom/)
with 'No thanks. I already get enough spam email'.

I finally capitulated as an increasing number of people I knew had
signed up. In any case, I was getting increasingly desperate in my
search for [Janet
Oldsgate](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2005/12/09/probably-the-best-phish-in-the-world/).

However, if you have any reason to interact with a recruitment agent for
any reason, think long and hard before adding him to your network.

A mutual friend made this mistake and consequently I received an
unsolicited approach (email and then a phone call) from a young lady.
Pity she was only trying to get me a highly paid job in the financial
sector with all those merchant bankers. Thanks but no thanks.
