I have a video of
[Pete](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/5038844.stm)
[Doherty](http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/thelive8event/pics/eltonjohn/?4#gallery-intro)'s,
err,
[duet](http://www.virgin.net/music/festivals2005/live8/gal_01_09.html)
with Elton John at Live 8.

It is clearly marked and I have removed the write-protect tab.

I am not a fan of The Libertines or Babyshambes.

I just want to use it to show my children that's what drugs do to you.
