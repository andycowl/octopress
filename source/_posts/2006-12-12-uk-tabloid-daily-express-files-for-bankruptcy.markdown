Finally, after nine years, we now learn that Princess Diana (Queen Of
Our Hearts Â©) was actually
[killed](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6170763.stm) by a drunk driver
who was driving too fast, in an effort to avoid paparazzi, through a
narrow tunnel in Paris.

There was no MI5 conspiracy so the Daily Express no longer has anything
to write about.
