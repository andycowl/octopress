13\. Years since Manchester City
[reached](http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/fa_cup/4796150.stm)
the quarter finals of the FA Cup.

30\. Years since Manchester City last won a trophy.

The best football banner in the world was very simple and understated -
just two large digits at the Stretford End. The number was incremented
on or around 28th February each year.

The banner is no longer at Old Trafford (following the Glazer takeover)
but can still be seen at
[FCUM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_United_of_Manchester) matches
apparently. Easier to get tickets too.
