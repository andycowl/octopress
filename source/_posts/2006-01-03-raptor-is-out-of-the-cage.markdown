Oracle have released
[Raptor](http://www.oracle.com/technology/products/database/project_raptor/index.html)
(a freely available GUI SQL query tool) which may be of interest to
those of you who use Toad or are frustrated with the terseness of the
SQL\*Plus interface.

Raptor is primarily a cross platform, PL/SQL developer tool, written in
Java (60 MB download). The SQL output is a scrollable grid (like Toad)
and there is the standard schema browser, PL/SQL debugger, SQL pretty
printer, DDL generator and a graphical interface to explain plan for
query tuning.

All in all, a very promising release which fills a surprising (to me)
gap in Oracle's range of database products.
