[Morwenna Banks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morwenna_Banks), who plays
Vicky in [Saxondale](http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/saxondale/), is superb.
While she gets some of the best lines in the comedy series, co-written
by Steve Coogan like
> 'Tell him to put some jam on his shoes and invite his trousers down
> for tea.'

...her delivery and timing is absolutely brilliant.
