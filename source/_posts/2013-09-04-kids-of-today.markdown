Over the weekend, I was helping Norman Junior III with a C programming
exercise (a wordsearch puzzle). I had rather hoped purchasing him the
original and definitive text '[Kernighan and Ritchie][K&R] (Second
Edition)' would enable him to become a C wizard without any further
intervention from me but no.

[K&R]: http://www.amazon.co.uk/C-Programming-Language-2nd/dp/0131103628

In a flash of inspiration, I had introduced some symbolic constants
for each of the eight possible directions.

When I asked him - 'Can you remember how to specify a constant in C
?', he replied 'Oh yeah - I know, I remember. Hashtag define'.

Sigh.
