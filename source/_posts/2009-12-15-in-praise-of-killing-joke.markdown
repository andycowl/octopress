After buying most of my Christmas presents from them, Amazon kindly gave
me a &pound;2 voucher to spend in the MP3 download store.

As the festive season of hosting friends and family approaches, I
decided on a 'easy listening', 'middle of the road' purchase suitable
for all the family to act as a quiet backdrop while we gather to play
charades around the fire. 

'[Killing
Joke](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Killing-Joke/dp/B0009RRRC8/ref=ntt_mus_ep_dpp_2)'
by '[Killing Joke](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_Joke)' was one
of the first vinyl records I ever bought and, as always, I was
introduced to the band by the wonderful [John
Peel](http://nbrightside.com/blog/2006/09/08/margrave-of-the-marshes). I
was intrigued by the cover art which I still think is brilliant.

Killing Joke also used another very striking and evocative image. When
I visited a mate in London, I was surprised to see he had a massive
Killing Joke poster adorning his lounge of Nazis saluting the Pope.
Initially, I thought it was a mock-up but he told me it was a genuine
photograph from the 1930's and while he wasn't a right-wing fascist
(quite the contrary in fact), he also thought it was a very striking
and thought provoking image.

I'm pleased to report the LP sounds as fresh as it did 30 years ago.
Deserves to be played loud.
