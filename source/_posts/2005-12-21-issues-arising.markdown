Doug Burns raises a surprising number of issues in a seemingly throwaway
comment about
[music](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2005/12/20/the-killers-at-live-8/#comments).

1. I used to say I only have three passions in life 'Music, Football
and Girls. The only thing that changes is the order.' :-)

2. Stuff that is too personal to discuss in a blog. I am startled about
certain stuff I have seen posted in blogs. Personal stuff that I would
never dream of posting.

3. Oracle versus Music verus Football. I started this blog after
lurking on the Oracle blog community for a while and intially thought I
would post occasional enlightening, technical articles which were met
with worldwide acclaim. After a while, I realised, those posts would be
few and far between.

The other Oracle bloggers cover that stuff far better than I ever could.
Also, I would make idiotic mistakes and have people correcting me all
the time. I think I can spend my time more profitably reading and
learning from others. To be honest, the technical niceties of PL/SQL
'bulk collect', bind variables and 10046 trace analysis can be a little
dry when that is your day job. I probably care more and have more to say
about music, football (blogging, software etc).

4. Another quandry about '
[blogging etiquette](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2005/11/10/blog-etiquette/)
'. I commented on Howard Rogers'
[view](http://dizwell.com/blog/2005/12/17/zeitgeist-or-coincidence/)
on the importance of calendar functionality in a blog. He answered my
questions fully and politely (but I still hold a contrary view). Now do
I take my followup to email or continue to comment on his blog article
when most people probably aren't interested ?

5. Indeed, should this lengthy post be a comment to Doug's comment, a
private email to Doug or a post in its own right ?

6. [Diction](http://dizwell.com/blog/2005/12/17/zeitgeist-or-coincidence/#comment-297).
When I read my own blog, I see long, rambling, interminable sentences.
This concerns me. Especially as I write a lot of technical reports as
part of my job for paying customers and I also play a major role in the
content of my kids' homework. I - sorry, my son - recently got a B+ for
a scintilliating project on San Francisco. I swear it should have been
an 'A++'.
