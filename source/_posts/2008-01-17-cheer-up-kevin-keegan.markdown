I was almost tempted to let Kevin Keegan's
re-[appointment](http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/n/newcastle_united/7192457.stm)
as manager of Newcastle pass without comment.

After Mourinho's departure, the Premiership (and the media) desperately
needs some more characters and
[soundbites](http://www.whoateallthepies.tv/2008/01/the_top_20_kevi.html).

However, I just read that since his departure from Manchester City,
Keegan has been running a football
[circus](http://sport.independent.co.uk/football/premier-league/article3345117.ece).
YCNMIU.

The ideal preparation for his latest role. And just for old times sake,
take a second to remember this classic (in full).

Let the mind games begin.
