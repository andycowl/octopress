I simply couldn't take any more so I reluctantly handed in my
[resignation](../2006/10/17/my-new-job) yesterday. I have moved my blog
to another cheap hosting provider, [Bluehost](http://bluehost.com/). If
this ends in tears, then I swear I am reverting to hosted WordPress. As
Steve Redgrave once said 'If you ever see me signing up with another
cheap hosting provider, shoot me !'

The migration was pretty straightforward. This time, I just imported the
complete mySQL database so all my posts, comments,
[plugins](../2006/10/16/couple-of-useful-wordpress-plugins), themes,
extensions and [hacks](../2006/10/10/improving-on-perfection) were
preserved. Internal links didn't need fixing up. I also downloaded a
copy of the Dreamhost Web site as a backup.

The only package that failed to arrive safely was
[MediaWiki](http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki) (which needs PHP5)
as Bluehost currently supports PHP 4.4 and mySQL 4.1 but
[PhpWiki](http://phpwiki.sourceforge.net/) is available.

Still, [Gregarius](http://sourceforge.net/projects/gregarius/) works
fine and [Drupal](http://drupal.org/) is available as a one-click
(rather than custom) install. Some you win, some you lose.

While the DNS changes are still propagating around the Interweb, I found
a useful
[note](http://helpdesk.bluehost.com/kb/index.php?x=&mod_id=2&id=316) in
the knowledge base which enabled me to configure the raw URL to
configure and check the Wordpress configuration.
