It's easy to get carried away with all this Web 2.0 nonsense. So while
you are trawling the blogosphere, desperately looking for invites to
[CoComment](http://www.cocomment.com/) and seeing whether 
[30 Boxes](http://www.30boxes.com/) does indeed live up to all the hype,
pause for a moment and look at two of my favourite blogs that offer a
slightly different perspective on Web 2.0.

[Go Flock Yourself](http://flocksucks.wordpress.com/) - Witty, incisive,
opinioniated comment. Always worth reading. The blog title alone still
brings a smile.

[Squash](http://squash.wordpress.com/) - Phil Sim also has some
interesting, thought provoking views from Down Under, albeit with
slightly less profanity. I have to say I find myself agreeing with
Phil's recent
[assessment](http://squash.wordpress.com/2006/02/07/30-boxes-is-the-bees-dick/)
of 30 Boxes.
