I support England but I simply can not help laughing uncontrollably at
this [goal](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zE1JTvbpv1A&eurl=). I wonder
what Steve Maclaren was jotting down:

-   'Give David James a call when I get home'
-   'More backpassing practice tomorrow'
-   'Get lawn cut at weekend'
-   'Wonder if Gareth will have me back as assistant ?'

Almost as amusing is the media backlash against Maclaren. Inevitably,
the honeymoon is over before it even started. Pity there is no-one
better to replace him.

Maybe, just maybe, England aren't as good as we seem to think we are.
