Seven weeks ago on this blog, I
[predicted](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/05/15/manchester-city-announce-new-manager/)
that Manchester City would appoint a foreign manager.

> 'However, I have a horrible feeling in the pit of my stomach that, in

> foreign manager.'

I also suggested the name of 'Sven Goran Eriksson' as the most likely
candidate to be appointed.

Now, seven weeks ago, you could get decent odds from your local bookie
on Eriksson being
[appointed](http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/man_city/6241052.stm):
100-1 in fact.

So, I put my money where my mouth was even though I don't follow Citeh
and decided to risk &pound;10 on a long shot.

However, if you, dear reader, shared my convictions and also followed my
sage advice, please do not waver now. Please do not be weak.

Now is the time to seize the moment. Now is the time to significantly
increase your original investment of &pound;10. Now is the time to be rich
beyond your wildest dreams.

Bet the &pound;1,000 proceeds (all of it) on this accumulator

-   Manchester City to win Premiership, Carling Cup and FA Cup in
    2007-2008 (2,500-1)
-   Manchester City to win Champions League in 2008-2009 (50,000-1)

In just two years, you will be 125,000,000,000 pounds richer.

Tell William Hill, I sent you.
