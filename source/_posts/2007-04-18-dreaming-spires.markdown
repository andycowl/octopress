After my recent
[holiday](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/04/16/letter-from-america/),
I have been sent on the road for two weeks. I am currently staying at
the (heinously overpriced)
[Malmaison](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/03/27/a-cause-for-concern/)
hotel in [Oxford](http://www.malmaison-oxford.com/).

This place is very expensive and seems like a gaol for the vertically
challenged. You emerge from reception into a prison wing. If you are
over 5' 8'' tall, you are forced to duck under the door to enter your
room.

Oxford is not car friendly. That is why you have to pay &pound;20 to park your
vehicle.

Watched Manchester United beat Sheffield United 2-0 at the Market Tavern
hostelry.

The Market Tavern is a curious mix of pretentious Oxford students,
dressed in shorts and flip-flops, discussing philosophy contrasted with
threatening, tattooed hard-cases from the Blackbird Leas estate.

I feared for my life until I spotted the referee of the inevitable
battle who was heavily tattooed but also sported khaki shorts and
flip-flops.

A band was simultaneously playing (practicing ?) upstairs. They had more
fans then Sheffield United and played a curious mix of blues and indie
rock-n-roll until an ill-advised cover of 'Never Mind' forced their 23
female groupies to depart en-masse for McDonalds.
