On 8 May 2001, Leeds United played in the European Champions League Semi
Final at Valencia in Spain. I thought it might be fun to look at the
Leeds lineup for that night and see what each player is up to now.

-   Nigel Martyn - Goalkeeping coach at Bradford City.
-   Danny Mills - on loan at Derby County, occasional pundit on BBC
    Radio 5.
-   Ian Harte - on trial at VÃ¥lerenga in Norway.
-   Rio Ferdinand - first choice England centre half and captain of
    Premier League and European Champions, Manchester United.
-   Dominic Matteo - playing for Stoke City in the Premiership.
-   Olivier Dacourt - playing for Inter Milan in Serie A in Italy.
-   Eirik Bakke - playing for SK Bann in Norway.
-   David Batty - runs a successful pig farm outside Malton, North
    Yorkshire.
-   Harry Kewell - blighted by injury and mental weakness, now at
    Galatasaray in Turkey.
-   Alan Smith - suffered horrendous ankle injury while at Manchester
    United. Now struggling to even warm the bench at Newcastle.
-   Mark Viduka - classic 'big time Charlie' also plying his trade
    occasionally at Newcastle.
-   Paul Robinson - deposed at first choice England and Spurs keeper.
    Now at Blackburn.
-   Gary Kelly - continued to serve his only club, Leeds, for 16 years
    until his retirement in 2007.
-   Alan Maybury - currently a free agent after spells at Hearts,
    Leicester and Aberdeen.
-   Jonathan Woodgate - astounded the footballing world by remaining
    injury free and playing three games in succession for Tottenham.
-   Stephen McPhail - now playing for Cardiff City in the Championship.
-   Jacob Burns - playing for Unirea Urziceni in Romania. Son of the
    lead singer of 'Stiff Little Fingers'.
-   Jason Wilcox - now retired after winning 3 England caps and runs a
    Judo school.

Leeds United are currently lying 7th in League Division 1 (Division 3 in
old money). Ex-player Garry McAllister is now manager and remains
confident of securing promotion after missing out twice in play-off
finals in recent seasons.

Yesterday, Leeds lost 1-0 to non-League Histon in the second round of
the FA Cup.

So you see - sometimes prayers are answered and sometimes dreams do come
true.
