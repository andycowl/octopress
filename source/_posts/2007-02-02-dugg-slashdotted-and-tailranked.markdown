Dear Reader

My cruel owner got very excited last night when he went to play with his
rotating tagline. Instead of his precious blog, much to his surprise, he
was presented with
[this](http://flickr.com/photos/70276096@N00/376841735/). His reaction
to this mundane error was startling.

My cruel owner was so excited and happy, I couldn't bear to tell him
this was just a temporary glitch on the Bluehost monitoring agent and
everything was back to nomal now.
Yours
