My name is Norman Brightside. I work for [Siebel
Systems](http://www.siebel.com/) based in Egham in the UK. I am a Senior
Architecture Specialist in Expert Services. Expert Services provide a
range of consulting services from architecture workshops to performance
troubleshooting.

My work is technical (usually includes
[Oracle](http://www.oracle.com/)), varied, includes travel to Siebel
customers located within the UK and Europe and perhaps, most
importantly, involves meeting interesting people and learning.
