I usually hate posts that start

'Apologies in advance but I am going to be offline for 10 days
because...'

-   I am going to a Web 2.0 conference in Dallas
-   I smashed my hand into a glass window
-   I am going on vacation
-   I am really busy at work
-   Personal stuff
-   I am getting married
-   I am going to an Oracle conference in Scotland
-   The RSI is killing me
-   My boss/wife/dog discovered this blog
-   I am having a blogging crisis of confidence
-   Family matters

Mainly because the author inevitably pops up the very next day without
any further explanation.
Apologies in advance but I am going to be offline for 10 days because
the postman delivered a package today. Well, more like a suspect
[device](http://www.directusbstore.co.uk/cnb/shop/directusbstore?productID=64&search=firewire+pci+card&op=catalogue-product_info-null),
actually.

A couple of months ago, I foolishly purchased a digital
[camcorder](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000MK3XVQ/202-2183615-0611840)
and now face the unenviable task of transferring the footage to DVD. I
have procrastinated for long enough. My long list of excuses is
exhausted. 'No - we can't simply to transfer to VHS tape because we now
own a digital camcorder. What on earth would the neighbours think ?'

I thought I had stumbled upon the perfect excuse. Not one of our modern
computers is equipped with a Firewire port to connect the Sony camcorder
to the PC. But no. Even that was rejected so I was forced to research
all the options and finally purchase a Firewire PCI card and cable.

This means I am going to have to open the lid on my computer. However, I
can approach this particular task with a great deal of confidence. Last
week, I surmounted this hurdle to check that my aged computer has an
available PCI slot. It only took me 25 minutes.

So, after I have finished work tonight, if I am not too tired, as long
as no-one invites me to the pub and if there is nothing on the telly, I
won't be donning a anti-static wrist strap but touching wood (and the
metal PC case). However, it is likely that I'll still manage to blow the
power supply.
