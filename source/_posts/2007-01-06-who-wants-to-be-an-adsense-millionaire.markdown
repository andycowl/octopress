Occasionally, I have been tempted to experiment with Google
[Adsense](https://www.google.com/adsense/default?destination=/adsense/home)
on this blog. Not because I think I will get rich and be able to retire
but I am curious to see how the technology works. Thankfully, to date,
laziness, inertia and minimalist tendencies have prevailed.

So I was very interested to read Guy Kawasaki's 12 month
[review](http://blog.guykawasaki.com/2007/01/a_review_of_my_.html) of
his popular [blog](http://blog.guykawasaki.com/). 'How To Change The
World' received 2.5 million page views (slightly more than my humble
blog), 7,000 comments (again, slightly more than my statistics) and
2,000 trackbacks (1,999 more than me) in 2006.

For all this effort, I was staggered to learn that this blog, with 4,217
inbound links, 21,000 subscribers and which consistently features in the
Technorati [Top 100](http://technorati.com/pop/blogs/), earned Guy
Kawasaki the princely sum of $3,350.
