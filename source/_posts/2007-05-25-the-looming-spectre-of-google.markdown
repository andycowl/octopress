The recent
[storm](http://scobleizer.com/2007/05/23/dog-distrustdisdain-of-google-moves-in/)
in the
[anti-blogosphere](http://www.therssweblog.com/?guid=20070524110855)
about [Google](http://www.google.com/)
[acquiring](http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/05/23/100-million-payday-for-feedburner-this-deal-is-confirmed/)
[Feedburner](http://www.feedburner.com), the frightening
[prospect](http://www.geeknewscentral.com/archives/007047.html) of
Google placing ads in your precious feeds, capturing all your personal
data, monitoring your every movement (online and offline) and logging
your brainwaves into the Google data warehouse is starting to irritate
me.

Despite the corporate
[motto](http://investor.google.com/conduct.html), please remember
Google is evil and 2084 is just around the corner, folks. Be aware
that Google just announced a partnership with global law enforcement
agencies to upload all CCT footage to YouTube.

Thankfully, some
[intelligent](http://marshallk.com/why-buying-feedburner-is-really-smart-of-google)
[people](http://andybeard.eu/2007/05/77-reasons-why-google-buying-feedburner-is-a-match-made-in-heaven-hell.html)
are able to distance themselves from the hype and present a more
[balanced](http://scobleizer.com/2007/05/24/another-reason-i-use-google-reader/)
viewpoint.

Another irritant is idiots bleating, ironically enough, in Google
Groups about the lack of
[monthly](http://groups.google.com/group/analytics-help-basics/browse_frm/thread/648a3ded5712a1e7/2f37bba1b8a3346c?lnk=gst&q=monthly&rnum=2#2f37bba1b8a3346c)
reports in the revamped Analytics and
[deficiencies](http://groups.google.com/group/Google-Labs-Reader/browse_frm/thread/46ecef4ffd2722da)
in Reader.

If you don't like Analytics V2, go back to [Site
Meter](http://sitemeter.sitetoolbox.com/) to track your e-commerce
site.  Let me know how you get on.

If you can't stand [Reader](http://www.google.com/reader/view/), shut
up and go back to
[Bloglines](http://www.vecosys.com/2007/05/24/i-hate-the-bloglines-plumber/)
and moan about that instead.

If you can no longer tolerate the unreliability and limitations of
Docs and Spreadsheets, upgrade to Office 2007 and use Word and
[Excel](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/09/14/google-versus-microsoft/).
The choice is yours.

I
[use](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/02/19/am-i-a-google-whore-yet/)
a lot of Google products (Gmail, Reader, Calendar, Analytics,
Notebook,
[Desktop](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/03/07/in-praise-of-google-desktop/),
Bookmarks, IG,
[Docs](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/10/11/google-docs-and-spreadsheets/),
Groups, Webmaster, Adsense oh and, err that Search thingy). My view is
that all are excellent, innovative software products and, best of all,
completely free of charge.

I really don't care that Google has stored every single keyword
related to my searches from October 1991.

I honestly don't care that Google has copies of my homework
[excuses](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/06/05/novel-homework-excuse/)
and letters to the Inland Revenue. Believe me, the contents are really
not that earth shattering.

I truly don't care that Google has copies of every single email I have
ever sent and received because, surprisingly, I have nothing to
hide. I only wish Google could get behind corporate firewalls and
retrieve the remainder as I have lost some magnificent blogging
material over the years.

If you are genuinely worried that Google is going to tell you what to
'[eat for
tea](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/c3e49548-088e-11dc-b11e-000b5df10621.html)',
maybe you should do the world a favour and start a protest on behalf
of all Interweb users by going on an indefinite hunger
strike. Immediately.

If you are a child molester or jumped the
[turnstiles](http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/l/liverpool/6686867.stm)
last night in Athens, then, by all means, please disable all cookies,
use [Ask.com](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/05/11/dont-ask/) or
give your computer to charity.

As for me, I am putting my money where my mouth in. The next purchase
in my
[SIPP](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2005/11/21/my-personal-pensions-crisis/)
will be the purchase of &pound;7,000 of
[GOOG](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=goog) stock. Tomorrow.
