'I Am Not Lefthanded' are a band who produce the most wonderful
music. The band are a three piece - mainly from Ireland - and the
lineup is:

* Kathryn - vocals, guitar, piano
* Daniel - bass, vocals
* Benji - drums

'I Am Not Lefthanded' have released a couple of EP's and are currently
putting the finishing touches to their first album - 'The Fire And The
Sigh'.

It's hard to categorise 'I Am Not Lefthanded' but they produce
beautiful melodies with the most fantastic vocals and lyrics. The
band's music and videos are available on their [site][ianl] so have a
listen and make your own mind up.

The band will be playing in London at Bush Hall on Friday 23 September
at [Bush Hall][bushhall] in Shepherd's Bush for an excellent cause.

I fell in love with the band's music since I first heard them on
[Dan Lynch][dan]'s excellent [Rathole Radio][rr] podcast which showcases a
eclectic mix of Creative Commons music.

Since then, I've bought both EP's in addition to some very stylish
IANL socks. I also managed to persuade Kathryn and Daniel to introduce
the new wonderful single 'Alone' on [episode 6][tinap6] of the award
winning, legendary '[This Is Not A Podcast][tinap]'.

Flushed, surprised and delighted by this achievement, I then chanced
my arm and asked Kathryn and Daniel if they would consider an
'interview' where I sent them miscellaneous random questions via email
which they would then scan and answer.

Needless to say - Kathryn and Daniel kindly acceded to my demands for
an interview - probably in an effort to rid themselves of this mad
stalker.

I was ecstatic that Kathryn and Daniel took time out of their busy
schedules to provide such detailed, lengthy, considered answers
(instead of quick, trite one-liners) and, hopefully, the 'interview'
makes fascinating reading.

Anyway, combined with my inane ramblings, the final result is rather
long so I have split the interview into two parts:

- [IANL - 'That Was Then'][part1]
- [IANL - 'This Is Now'][part2]
