I guess the Papal entrourage must have landed at Terminal 3 and endured
the inevitable 20 minute wait for a bus to be brought up to the
aircraft. If only the Italian check-in staff had put those red
‘Priority' tags on their suitcases.

Still, it's a bit rich coming from a man who wears a pointy hat and
attaches the same importance to the ordination of women as to the sexual
abuse of children by Catholic priests.
