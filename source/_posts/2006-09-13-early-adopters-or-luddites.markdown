I subscribe to a fair number of blogs.

Some of those bloggers use Blogger (despite my WordPress evangelism).

Some of those Blogger bloggers are technical types who would normally
seize any chance to play with newly announced beta software.

Curiously, not a single one of them has experimented with the recently
announced Blogger
[beta](http://buzz.blogger.com/2006/08/blogger-in-beta.html) which
includes exciting new developments like 'Labels', drag'n'drop page
design, private blogs (where you can be assured no-one is reading),
multiple authors, additional templates, RSS feeds and 'instant'
publishing.

I lie awake at night and wonder - why ?
