'How I ditched Windows and embraced Linux' - the prequel.

On Saturday morning, I thought it might be fun to install Linux on my
home computer. A year ago, I had experimented with a few Live CD's and
actually installed Ubuntu (not officially supported) followed by Oracle
Enterprise Linux (officially supported) on my work laptop (Thinkpad
T61). For various reasons, I subsequently had to reverse that change so
I thought it might be worthwhile and interesting to install Ubuntu on my
own computer (an aging but reliable Dell 4500).

There was no problem with the computer, there was no problem with
Windows XP. I am not a rabid, freedom loving, Microsoft hating
individual. I just wanted to play around with Linux before 'Football
Focus'.

As Norma also uses this computer (email, Web, Word documents), I decided
to install Ubuntu as a dual-boot option alongside the existing stable
Windows environment. This was firstly to evaluate whether Linux
supported all my various peripherals and software requirements and
secondly, let people continue to use Windows.

I dug out an old Ubuntu (8.04 - Hardy Heron) Live CD and started the
installation process. When I came to partition the hard disk, I chose
the 'Advanced' option so I could preserve all my existing data with 60GB
allocated to Windows with another 20GB for Linux.

The re-partitioning failed; the 'ntfsresize' program helpfully told me
with a typically cryptic Unix style error that '1028 is greater than
1024'. No matter - just get a Windows recovery disk and use the 'fdisk'
utility to re-partition.

I booted from the Windows recovery CD. After a while I saw 'Files being
copied for installation...' and wondered if I had missed the prompt to
enter a DOS prompt enabling me to run fdisk. So, I hit 'Control-C' and
rebooted. As I expected, my computer was now completely screwed as I had
aborted during a full installation.

I sighed inwardly at my impetuousness and stupidity. I also blamed
[David Marsden](http://identi.ca/davidmarsden) who had helped sow this
original tiny, little seed in my brain which was now turning into a long
running saga and a complete waste of time and effort. Just to get back
to where we had started. Almost.

This whole exercise was a classic example of [Yak
shaving](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2005/03/dont_shave_that.html)
as its finest. I was justifiably proud of myself.

I decided to postpone the Linux experiment to another day and simply
re-installed Windows. One hour later, the machine was usable again. All
my data was preserved so I took a full backup to an external USB drive.
However, although none of my programs were installed and the Windows
registry was pure and virginal, the 'Program Files' directory was
horrendously cluttered with lots of unused folders.

Now I had a choice; dig out all those drivers and install disks for my
Linksys Wireless Adapter, Canon printer, scanner, reinstall and
reconfigure all the important software (Picasa, Firefox, Office, Outlook
Express) so the machine would actually be usable again. Preferably
before Norma got home and asked 'Can I just quickly check my email ?'

Alternatively, now I had a full backup, I could do the right thing,
rebuild the computer completely and install Linux. So that's what I did.
Only I didn't because I wasn't entirely sure Ubuntu was the best Linux
distribution for me. Using the excellent, open source program
[InfraRecorder](http://infrarecorder.org/). I embarked on burning ISO
images for all those distributions I was aware of, have seen recommended
or reviewed recently.

I also perused [DistroWatch](http://distrowatch.com/) to look for the
most popular and used Dan Lynch's excellent, comprehensive, honest,
balanced [reviews](http://danlynch.org/blog/category/review/) of various
Linux distributions.

The cast list, in no particular order:

-   [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/) (8.04)
-   [OpenSUSE](http://www.opensuse.org/en/) 11 - lurking in my drawers
    for the last 12 months
-   [Mint](http://www.linuxmint.com/) 5 (xfce) - also last year's
    vintage
-   [Fedora](http://fedoraproject.org/) 11
-   [Mandriva](http://www.mandriva.com/)
-   [CrunchBang](http://crunchbanglinux.org/) 9.04
-   [Arch](http://www.archlinux.org/)
-   [PCLinuxOS](http://www.pclinuxos.com/)
-   [Debian](http://www.debian.org/) 5.0
