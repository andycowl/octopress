The new machine from Dell duly
[arrived](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/03/07/rapid-fire-service-from-dell/)
yesterday so I hid it safely away in a tall cupboard.

This morning, when no-one was looking, I surreptitiously retrieved the
boxes out of the tall cupboard and carefully cut the boxes open.

Then I quickly hooked up the new PC to my existing keyboard, mouse and
monitor and power cable.

I had a sneak peek at Windows Vista and it looked pretty nice (IE7,
integrated desktop search, media player, shiny new interface).

Then I carefully packed the computer away, taped the boxes up and put
them all back into the tall cupboard.

What am I ?
