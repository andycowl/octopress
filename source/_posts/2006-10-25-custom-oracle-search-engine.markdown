Google [Co-op](http://www.google.com/coop/) is a customisable Google
search engine and I just created a personalised, custom
[search](http://www.google.com/coop/cse?cx=012976428869982644131:gyw-d0vkp10)
for Oracle that scours [AskTom](http://asktom.oracle.com), Jonathan
Lewis' [site](http://www.jlcomp.demon.co.uk/) and
[www.oracle.com](http://www.oracle.com/) (including TechNet).

This targetted search is useful and will undoubtedly save me time.
However, I was unable to get any results from
'[tahiti.oracle.com](http://tahiti.oracle.com/)' (Oracle documentation
set) which is normally my first port of call. Also, I assume
[Metalink](http://metalink.oracle.com/) is similarly off limits (account
required).
