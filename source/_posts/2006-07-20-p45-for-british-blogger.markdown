Quelle horreur !

A female UK blogger is
[sacked](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/5196228.stm) by a
French company, supposedly for 'gross misconduct'.

I went to look at the actual
[blog](http://www.petiteanglaise.com.nyud.net:8080/) to discover what
juicy office gossip she had revealed, but the blog is such an
incoherent, rambling mess of disjointed thoughts using pseusonyms to
conceal her true identity, I simply gave up.

Inevitably, Robert Scoble thinks this is very, very
[important](http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/2006/07/19/french-blogger-sacked/).
I don't.
