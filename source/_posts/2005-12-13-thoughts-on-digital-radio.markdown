Two things that are not immediately obvious about digital radio.

1.  Not all DAB stations are national. You may be able to listen to
    Capital Radio in Brisbane over the Internet but you can't listen to
    Capital Radio on a digital radio in Inverness. This is because
    'local' radio stations are still subject to UK broadcasting
    regulations which means they must remain local, even with DAB.
    Consequently, the range of radio stations available on DAB isn't
    (quite) as wide ranging as you might expect.
2.  The sound quality of FM radio is better than DAB. Tune the same
    radio station in on FM and DAB, turn up the volume and toggle
    between the two. The difference is quite marked. I used to think my
    ears? wouldn't be able to distinguish between an expensive Bang &
    Oulfsen system costing 2,000 GBP and an Alba record player. I was
    wrong.
