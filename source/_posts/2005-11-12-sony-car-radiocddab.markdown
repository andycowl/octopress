I have got an old radio cassette in my car with a aerial mounted in the
rear windscreen. The MW reception is pretty poor and if you go under a
bridge, the interference nearly makes your ears bleed. As I listen to
Radio 5 Live quite a lot, this is rather irritating.

After months of prevaricating and thinking, I impetuously went out and
bought a Sony
[DAB6650.](http://www.sony.co.uk/view/ShowProduct.action?product=CDX-DAB6650&site=odw_en_GB&pageType=Overview&category=ICA+CD+Tuners)
This is a DAB radio (with FM/MW/LW as well) and a CD player. The unit
looks and sounds great and I now have access to lots of different DAB
stations.

Although I haven't travelled that far yet, the digital sound quality is
excellent, even in towns and under bridges.

The only slight downside is that the CD formats include MP3 or Atrac but
does not include WMA. Unfortunately all my CD's are ripped in WMA format
but I have a handful also copied in Atrac format for my Sony MD player.
