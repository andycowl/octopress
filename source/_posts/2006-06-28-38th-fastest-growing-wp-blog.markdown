One of the things I like about WordPress is the sense of community.
Wordpress users (and developers) willingly help each other out on the
support [forums][]. There is also a [FAQ][] with useful information for
newcomers and experienced users alike.

You can find similar, related WordPress blogs of interest usings
[tags][] and you can also discover new material by examining the league
tables of the most popular WordPress blogs, individual articles and the
fastest growing blogs over on [botd.wordpress.com][].

So, imagine my surprise when I saw this humble blog nestling at No.
[38][] in the list of ‘Fastest Growing Blogs’.

My life is now complete. Almost.
