One of the things I like about WordPress is the sense of community. Wordpress users (and developers) willingly help each other out on the support <a href="http://wordpress.com/forums/">forums</a>. There is also a <a href="http://faq.wordpress.com/">FAQ</a> with useful information for newcomers and experienced users alike.
</p>
<p>
You can find similar, related WordPress blogs of interest usings <a href="http://wordpress.com/tags/">tags</a> and you can also discover new material by examining the league tables of the most popular WordPress blogs, individual articles and the fastest growing blogs over on <a href="http://botd.wordpress.com/growing-blogs/?lang=en">botd.wordpress.com</a>.
</p>
<p>
So, imagine my surprise when I saw this humble blog nestling at No. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/70276096@N00/176950641/">38</a> in the list of 'Fastest Growing Blogs'.
</p>
<p>
My life is now complete. Almost.
