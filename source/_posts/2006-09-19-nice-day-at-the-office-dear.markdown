Yesterday I had a pretty bad day. I got up early and drove to
Chesterfield. Unfortunately, the performance environment was not
available as originally planned (overrunning weekend engineering works)
so I simply collected some data and drove back to London.

Still, it could have been worse. The original plan had me staying
overnight in a hotel in Chesterfield.

Although this unexpected change of plan was inconvenient and tiring, it
still wasn't as terrible as this gentleman's [bad
day](http://oiyoublogoff.blogspot.com/2006/09/fear-not-blog-fans.html)

I am certain he has made the correct decision in giving up beekeeping.
Maybe he should now study 'How to unlock a door - quickly !'
