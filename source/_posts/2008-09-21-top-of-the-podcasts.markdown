I recently got an iTouch and, as I have been commuting into London
recently, I have been listening to a few podcasts in an effort to
usefully pass the time.

-   [Digital Planet](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/podcasts/digitalp/) -
    BBC's short (30 minute) roundup of technology news. Tends to cover
    new and interesting topics not on my conventional radar.
-   [Ricky Gervais](http://www.rickygervais.com/podcasts2.php) - Yes,
    sometimes he's repetitive and childish but Ricky Gervais still
    produces occasional moments of pure genius that bring you to tears.
    Also features co-writer Stephen Merchant and Karl (perennial
    scapegoat) Pilkington.
-   [FIR](http://www.forimmediaterelease.biz/) - [Neville
    Hobson](http://www.nevillehobson.com/) is one of my favourite UK
    bloggers and this twice weekly 'For Immediate Release' podcast
    (co-hosted with Shel Holtz) covers a wide range of developments in
    social media and use of new technology in the Enterprise both in the
    US and Europe.
-   [Fighting Talk](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/podcasts/ft/) - Like
    Gervais, Colin Murray seems to provoke strong opinions but I like
    his sense of humour and quick wit as he comperes a sporting 'Have I
    Got News For You' style quiz.
-   [This Week in Tech](http://twit.tv/twit) - Leo Laporte's popular
    podcast. If you've been away from Google Reader for a while, this
    podcast is a great way to catch up with events from the tech world.
-   [Linux Outlaws](http://linuxoutlaws.com/podcast) - Last but by no
    means last, my favourite podcast. Co-hosted by Dan Lynch (Liverpool)
    and Fabian Scherschel (Germany), Linux Outlaws is a comprehensive
    summary of OpenSource news, Linux distros, 'Micro(soft) watch'
    including interviews and feedback from the community. Informative,
    honest and occasionally very funny. Love the theme music (created by
    Dan) too.
