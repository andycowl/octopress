So, you can now buy the program for last Sunday's Manchester United
game against Chelsea in WH Smiths.

I used to go to Old Trafford every fortnight in the late 70's and 80's
(Stretford Paddock, Stretford End, United Road). Part of the
experience was travelling there, getting to the ground early, securing
your position on a barrier, reading the program, the atmosphere
building, the smell of pies and bovril, the chanting, the opposition
fans, the players warming up, the tension, the goals, the
celebrations, the moaning, everything.

Then I moved away from Manchester and was relegated to a barstool
correspondent and finally a slave to Sky Sports in my armchair. Still,
at least now, I can read the program a full week after the game has
finished.
