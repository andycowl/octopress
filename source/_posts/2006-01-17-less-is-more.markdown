I was recently without my laptop computer for a whole two hours.

I found the experience quite liberating.

I cleared my drawers of three years' worth of accumulated clutter and
paperwork.

I was then able to sit down quietly and read a whole chapter of a book
(Jonathan Lewis' Practical Oracle 8i) on Oracle partitioning which has a
fantastic analogy with the Encyclopedia Britannica. This is very useful
because when non-technical people ask you about partitioning, this is
exactly the analogy you should use (as opposed to 'buckets' and
'partition elimination').

I then made a list with pen and paper of things to get done. Old
technology, admittedly.

I then called some people on the telephone and spoke to them.

Then, finally, I got bored and pestered my colleagues, begging on one
knee for just 5 minutes on their computer.
