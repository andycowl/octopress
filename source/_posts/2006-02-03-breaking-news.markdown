Good news. A kind, thoughtful, considerate colleague noticed my
unattended Palm and placed it in a locked drawer for safe keeping.
Unusually, for such a kind, thoughtful and considerate person, he
omitted to send me a note telling me.

Bad news. I will be writing my own Christmas cards this year.

The planned filming of the reconstruction next Wednesday, to be
broadcast on this month's edition of BBC Crimewatch, has now been
cancelled.

Many thanks to all for your messages of support during this testing
time.

PS. Sincere apologies to any recipients of those awful poison pen
letters.
