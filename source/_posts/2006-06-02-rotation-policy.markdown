WordPress has a total of 37 themes. I have recently fallen out with my
long standing favourite and top scorer, Regulus 2.1.3, after he
blatantly deceived me over the state of his CSS injury.

Consequently, I will be implementing a rotation policy (with immediate
effect) to give each squad member a fair and equitable chance to stake
his claim (hand in glove).

Then I will conduct a poll of all my loyal readers (both of them) to
determine the winner.

Then I will reinstate Regulus 2.1.3.
