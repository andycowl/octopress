Idea for a new TV series - 'When Ethernet cables go bad' - A
fascinating 60 minute documentary into the wide range of issues people
have with wireless networks. The program would also include some 'C'
list celebrities and a phone/text in competition to win something.

I have had a wireless network in my house for at least four
years. Perusing the annals of this blog reveals that while I have
experienced
[various](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/04/11/wireless-upgrade/),
[sporadic](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/02/24/wireless-wierdness/)
[issues](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/04/17/more-wireless-fun/)
over this period, by and large, the wireless network has been pretty
reliable with three PC's, a laptop and an iTouch device using it
without problems.

Most issues could be resolved simply by rebooting the router and cable
modem or very occasionally traced to a broader problem with network
connectivity from my ISP, Virgin Media.

Recently, my 7x24 Internet monitoring service known as my son came
down into the lounge to watch TV. This normally means one thing - the
Interweb is down and Call of Duty is missing one of their
Lieutenants. And so it proved.

On this occasion, rebooting the router and modem didn't resolve the
problem and plugging a laptop into the cable modem proved that the
lack of connectivity wasn't due to Virgin Media.

A hard reset to the factory defaults and running an open network
worked. For a while. Then the router dropped again. Installing the
Linksys firmware to replace the open source and freedom loving
[Tomato](http://www.polarcloud.com/tomato) software worked. Briefly.
Then it broke again. Stubbornly the router reported 'Could not renew
lease.'. No matter how many times, or how hard, I hit the 'Renew
Lease' button.

This state of affairs simply could not continue so after investigating
a little on the Interweb, I reached the reluctant conclusion that my 5
year old Linksys wireless router was, in technical terms, broken.

Curiously, for me, I spontaneously decided to buy another Linksys
router to replace it. A like for like replacement.  Subconsciously,
despite the unit failing, I still viewed Linksys as reliable and found
myself strangely reluctant to try another make and model.

I quickly shopped around and purchased a [Linksys
WRT54GL](http://www.ebuyer.com/product/103185) and, to my surprise,
found it slightly cheaper at ebuyer.com than my usual preference for
online purchases - Amazon. The router arrived the next day and I was
able to quickly configure the network again as the family gathered
expectantly inquiring 'Can I play Call of Duty yet ?', 'When can I
check my email ?' and 'Listen - I need to get on Facebook now.'

Everything ran smoothly and everyone was deliriously happy. For 8 days
until Norman Junior III came down into the lounge to watch TV
again. After a period of 8 full days without watching any TV or
speaking to us. 

'Is it down again ?' 'Yeah - I rebooted both boxes and
my PC can see the router but the router can't access the Internet.'

Back upstairs to stare at the Administration screens and the
worryingly familiar 'Can not renew IP address' message. This time, I
installed the Tomato firmware which worked briefly. I then reverted to
the Linksys firmware as I prepared to raise the problem with Linksys
technical support. But I didn't need to as, after resetting to the
factory defaults and reconfiguring, it worked. Internet access was
restored. Everyone was happy and didn't thank me. For a couple of
days.

This loss of connectivity was now a complete mystery and now
starting to get very irritating. Brand new router. Sporadically
failing. My son and I stared at the blue box with the flashing lights
and the contents of the new router box looking for the sentence on
'Troubleshooting'.

Norman Junior broke a rather stony and tense silence: 'What's that
blue cable ?' 'Oh - it's just an Ethernet cable that came with the
router.' 'Maybe that would work better as it's brand new.' 'It won't
be that. These problems are not caused by an Ethernet cable. They
either work or they don't.'

'What's the harm in trying it though ? We haven't got any other ideas,
have we ?' So I exhaled loudly, sighed, threw in a couple of
expletives and switched the original grey Ethernet cable supplied all
those years ago by Virgin Media with a shiny, new, slightly shorter
blue Ethernet cable.

And lo and behold, the blue Ethernet cable worked. Access to the
wireless was restored. The bloody Internet worked. Perfectly. For 3
weeks, 4 days and 17 hours and counting. Rock solid.

He's a bloody genius, my son.

And the elephant in the room - the original 'failed' Linksys WRT54G
router sitting up on top of the wardrobe, taunting me, calling to me,
nagging away at me like a dripping tap. The temptation to switch back
to the original router and try it with the blue Ethernet cable is one
I have been able to resist. So far.
