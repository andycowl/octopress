After thoroughly enjoying watching
[Arsenal](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/10/08/arsenal-v-sunderland/)
defeat Sunderland at the Emirates, I resolved to get off my barstool and
try to get to see more live football in 2008.

Consequently, I have just purchased two tickets (South Level 5) for
England versus Switzerland in a friendly on Wednesday 6 February.

Of course, I already know what the
[outcome](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/12/24/sporting-predictions-for-2008/)
will be but I am keen to visit the new Wembley Stadium and show Norman
Junior what real England supporters are like.

Whatever next - a United away perhaps.
