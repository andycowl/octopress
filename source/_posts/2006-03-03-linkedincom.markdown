I spurned my first few invitations to
[linkedin.com](http://www.linkedin.com/) as I already get plenty of spam
email.

However, I finally succumbed but now I am very fearful that someone,
someday will receive the following endorsement from me so please, please
don't ever connect to my network.

> "Simply the best technical consultant, called Norman, who lives in
> Inverness, I have ever had the pleasure of working with. Mr. N.
> Brightside has an awesome and exceptional knowledge of PowerPoint
> internals. Definitely a member of my A-Team.
> PS. Always stands his round too which is also important."
