Apologies to all you Oracle Bloggers.

Excessive traffic levels to my new Web
[journal](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/06/08/recently-i-gave-birth-to-a-blog/)
on [Blogger](http://www.blogger.com/) appears to have breached the
'tipping point' and tipped it right over the edge.

Blogger is unavailable (again). Two nights running. Hmm.
