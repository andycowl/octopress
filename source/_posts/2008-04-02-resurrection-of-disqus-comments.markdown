Five months ago, I
[experimented](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/10/31/disqus-powered-comments/)
with [Disqus](http://www.disqus.com/) powered comments when this blog
was running on WordPress. The trial was rather short-lived because I was
disappointed that Disqus wasn't able to fully integrate with all the
existing blog comments. Importing comments still isn't possible but
Disqus says this feature is being worked on.

However, I have decided to reinstate Disqus for the following reasons:

-   Disqus recently added
    [integration](http://blog.disqus.net/2008/03/24/add-your-disqus-profile-on-friendfeed/)
    with FriendFeed so any contributions I make on Disqus powered blogs
    will also be visible in my FriendFeed
    [stream](http://friendfeed.com/andyc).
-   I am encountering an ever increasing number of blogs using Disqus.
-   I am hoping Disqus will help to trigger more comments, interest and
    interaction on the blog.
-   Disqus provide a nice combination widget providing 'Popular',
    'Recent Comments' and 'People'.
-   The most recent
    [release](http://blog.disqus.net/2008/03/14/disqus-releases-beta-2-â€“-new-features-lots-of-bug-fixes-improved-performance/)
    of Disqus included a raft of changes including support for Open ID.
-   Disqus is being actively developed and, more importantly,
    [listen](http://shegeeks.net/great-quality-customer-support-with-disqus/)
    to their users.

I still have some reservations that the couple of articles with decent
comment threads included replies to earlier comments (which are no
longer visible) so we are literally starting from zero. However,
hopefully some comments will appear soon and the tabs will actually
display something !

Aside: Unfortunately, adopting Disqus means I will no longer be using
[Matt Read](http://mattread.com/)'s recently
[released](http://twitter.com/MattRead/statuses/779438983)
[Defensio](http://www.defensio.com/) plugin which is excellent and
highly recommended for any [Habari](http://www.habariproject.org/en/)
bloggers wading through a torrent of comment spam.
