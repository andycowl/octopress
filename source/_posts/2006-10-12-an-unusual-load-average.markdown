I might have been dreaming but I swear that the load average on this
DreamHost server was over
[400](http://flickr.com/photos/70276096@N00/267787342/).

Now I realise DreamHost is offering inexpensive, shared hosting but this
is a little excessive.

I just wish they'd told me I would be co-hosted with Amazon, Yahoo and
eBay.
