Not it's not unavailable but Google have added support for
[offline](http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2007/05/oh-sam-i-am-can-i-read-it-on-tram.html)
reading of up to 2,000 items using the recently announced Google
[Gears](http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/05/30/google-gears-lets-developers-take-apps-offline/).

Another much requested feature and a surprising omission from Reader -
the ability to search feeds - is also thought to be on the
[horizon](http://googlified.com/2007search-coming-to-google-reader-soon/).
