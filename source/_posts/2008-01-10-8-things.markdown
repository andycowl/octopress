	<li>In my first year at University, I had a lecturer who was male. When I returned for my second year, he was a woman.</li>
	<li>My first brush with the police was at 14 when I crossed Chester Road against police orders and a copper said 'Think that's funny, eh ? Would you still think it's funny if I took you into that van and kicked your head in ?'</li>
	<li>I have seen United win (1977), draw (1983) and lose (1995) in an FA Cup Final.</li>
	<li>The Hillsborough disaster saddened me but when The Independent posted photographs of people crushed against metal fences, gasping for breath, dying, I broke down and cried like a baby.</li>
	<li>Most of the people I care about now live in Australia. Slowly but surely, I am getting the message.</li>
	<li>I am the only person in my family not to have broken a limb.</li>
	<li>I have stood on the top of Ayers Rock.</li>
	<li>I joined a gym on 1 December 2007. Since then I have lost 1 stone but I'm sure it will turn up somewhere.</li>
