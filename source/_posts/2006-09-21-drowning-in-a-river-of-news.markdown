I have an increasing tendency to skim all my RSS feeds in
[Netvibes](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/05/25/good-vibes-from-netvibes/)
just to finish reading them as quickly as possible and not really reading (or
enjoying) the content.

My therapist recommended some diversion therapy; install the
[Gregarius](http://gregarius.net/) aggregator locally on my PC, import
my OPML and experiment with Dave
[Winer](http://scripting.wordpress.com/)'s controversial '
[River of News](http://www.reallysimplesyndication.com/riverOfNews)' concept.

Now my previous experiments with
[Joomla](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/01/31/finally-succumbed/)
and subsequently [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/) and
[Drupal](http://drupal.org/) have been made incredibly easy by
[Wamp](http://www.wampserver.com/en/) (a packaged distribution of mySQL,
PHP and Apache).

And so it proved again. A mere 7 minutes to get Gregarius working. A
further 29 minutes to fail to work out why Netvibes has chosen to
resurrect and export some dear, dead departed
[feeds](http://oracledoug.com/serendipity/) (with Japanese writing) from
beyond the grave.

Gregarius has the conventional
[two pane](http://flickr.com/photos/70276096@N00/249333422/in/photostream/)
(feed-article) view and you can quickly review all articles from all
blogs in reverse date order. You can then choose to expand any
[articles](http://flickr.com/photos/70276096@N00/249333418/in/photostream/)
of particular interest.

Of course, for the full cascading river
[effect](http://flickr.com/photos/70276096@N00/249333419/in/photostream/),
I had to collapse the feeds and remove all
[tags](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/03/02/tags-categories-and-labels/),
folders and categories to simply let all feeds flow as one raging
torrent. There are no Oracle blogs anymore. You are all fighting for a
place on the raft.

The default Gregarius theme is a little monochrome for my liking or
maybe that is the default 'Newspaper' view (black and white and read all
over) but there are other
[themes](http://flickr.com/photos/70276096@N00/249333421/in/photostream/)
available to liven up the RSS experience.

So now I am no longer skimming my 81 feeds but blissfully wallowing in
this river of news.

All of this excitement is almost enough to encourage me to investigate
pricing (again) for hosted PHP/mySQL providers so I can read the same
feeds from multiple computers.
