Amazing news - whales have feelings and can understand humans.

'How a wave of human compassion will have comforted the whale in his
final hours'

'He'd have known we're trying to help but it couldn't save him'

But what was really amusing about the bottlenose whale stranded in the
River Thames story was that a friend recently returned from a holiday in
Canada where he went whale watching. He was unlucky and saw absolutely
nothing apart in a whole day apart from the bobbing waves. He then
returns home to London to find one sitting on his doorstep.
