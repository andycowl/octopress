There is a new, improved Monthly Archives plugin
[available](http://trac.habariproject.org/habari-extras/changeset/171)
for Habari which is now installed on this blog.

I realise that I'm probably the only person to ever scan the historical
[archives](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/archives) but I really like
it so, once again, many thanks to [Chris
Meller](http://incoherentbabble.com/) and the Habari community.
