A [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_VmZMQj5c) of 'Jean'
(unplugged) with Sandie Shaw on vocals and Johnny Marr on acoustic
guitar in Kew gardens surrounded by Morrissey, Rourke, Joyce and
assorted children.

I think I might wake up tomorrow morning to discover I dreamt all this.
If so, I apologise profusely in advance.
