Mum and Dad

Having cool time on Crete (geddit ?) with Bazzer, Nobby, TenBob,
SickNote and the three 'S's.

Sun = wicked. Sea = wicked. Sex = wicked (geddit ?). Loadsa Brits out
here. Able to get The Sun delivered. Happy hour - all day long (nudge,
nudge).

Last night, I asked a bird if she fancied a ride on my very own 'banana
boat'.

She slapped me (just like being back at home :-) then she poured sambuca
all over me balls.

I went: 'Hey - hang on love, let's get back to me hotel room. There's
people watching here, innit ?'

Then she got a lighter and set
[fire](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/8189296.stm) to me balls.
Ouch.

Bazzer said I should have said 'OK - I suppose a shag's out of the
question then ?' but I was diving into the swimming pool.

Will be laid up in hospital for a bit (but I won't be getting 'a bit'
for a while - geddit ?).

Hope to be out by Thursday as Julian's taking us all to Knossos for the
day.

Luv ya - Stuart.
