The first in an occasional series.

No. 1 - [O'Reilly's](http://www.oreillys.com/brussels/index.htm) in
Brussels.

Difficult to find, particularly if you hold the street map upside down
and wander aimlessly down dark, empty streets and end up in Schaerbeek.

Easy to find if you hold the map the right way up.

Stella - 4 Euro per pint. Lively pub. One big screen and several small
screens dotted around. Plenty of seating available.

Blackburn 1 - MUFC 1 (Carling Cup Semi Final). Two superb goals. One
melee involving Rooney.
