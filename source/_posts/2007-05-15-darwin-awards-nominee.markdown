Amusing
[story](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/05/11/nsatnav11.xml)
in Friday's Torygraph about how a Sat Nav system left a poor, helpless
20- year old female student marooned on a level crossing in the face of
a high speed train.

Thankfully, this woman escaped with her life and will probably sue
[TomTom](http://www.tomtom.com/), her boyfriend and Carlos Tevez.
However, Paula Ceely is so unbelievably stupid, hopefully she will
manage to secure an early nomination for the
[Darwin Awards](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin_Awards) imminently.

The online version of this story omits a crucial section - the picture
of the warning sign that was clearly displayed on the level crossing
that was included in the newspaper edition.

1.  Check that the green light shows
2.  Open both gates
3.  Check that the green light still shows
4.  Cross quickly
5.  Close both gates

RTFM.
