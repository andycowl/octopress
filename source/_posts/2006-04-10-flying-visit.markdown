Last night, I flew to Stockholm
[airport](http://www.arlandaexpress.com/). I stayed overnight in a
[hotel](http://www.radissonsas.com/servlet/ContentServer?pagename=RadissonSAS/integration/hotelInfo&hotelCode=stozr&language=en&backURI=/reservation/rateSearch.do&origin=Rates%20And%20Availability)
at the airport.

Today I went to a meeting in a conference
[centre](http://www.primepoint.com/eng/) at Stockholm airport. I talked,
listened, answered a few questions and asked a few questions.

Then I flew home from Stockholm airport.

18 hours in Stockholm and I never left the airport complex. Weird.
