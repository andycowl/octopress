People often write in and ask 'Is Oracle blogging dead ?'

Well, I thought it might be interesting to revisit the list of Oracle
blogs I [posted][top10] way back in 2007 and see what they're up to.

[top10]: http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/03/03/top-of-the-oracle-blogs/

- [Life After Coffee][coffee] - dead (last post May 2011). The
  pressure of the No. 1 slot proved too much.
- [The Tom Kyte Blog][kyte] - frequency much reduced but Tom's a busy
  man.
- [Rittman Mead][rittman] - now a multi-user, shiny, corporate blog.
- [Oracle Scratchpad][lewis] - Jonathan Lewis is still going strong.
- [Eddie Awad][awad] ...so is Eddie.
- [Doug Burns][burns] - Our favourite Scotsman is still active and
  contemplating a migration away from Serendipity.
- [Kevin Closson][closson] - occasional poster.
- [David Aldridge][aldridge] - as above (when something annoys him).
- [Tim Hall][hall] - still travelling the world, presenting, reading
  books and watching weird films.
- [Jeff Hunter][hunter] - resting (inactive since May 2012).
- [Peter Scott][scott] - alive and well blogging under the Rittman
  Mead umbrella.
- [Andrew Clarke][clarke] - sporadic flurries of activity from Tooting.
- [Chris Foot][foot] - not known at this address.
- [William Robertson][robertson] - still manages to exclaim 'WTF?!' 
  once a year.
- [Howard Rogers][rogers] - still blogging from Down Under.
- [Robert Vollman][vollman] - resting (since August 2012).
- [Andy Campbell][campbell] - hijacked by spammers. Either that or he
  really is pimping satellite TV systems and payday loans.
- [Moans Norgaard][norgaard] - pining for the fjords (since July 2010).
- [Laurent Schneider][schneider] - actively blogging about Oracle.
- [Lisa Dobson][dobson] - went to the trouble of getting her own domain and
  then neglected it (since Sept 2011). No longer a 'newbie'.
- [Jeff Moss][moss] - pimping vacations in Florida.
- [Beth][beth] - Data Geek Gal has been quiet on data quality (since Oct 2012).
- [Steve Karam][karam] - the alchemist is busy mixing up strange concoctions
  involving Hadoop, Hue, Oozie  and occasionally Oracle.
- [Eric Emrick][emrick] - nothing since March 2009.
- [Alex Gorbachev][gorbachev] - busy growing Pythian Corp.
- [Robert Baillie][baillie] - blogging about Agile, Extreme and
  project management after a 3 year lull.
- [Gary Myers][myers] - moved house (still in Oz) but helpfully
  remembered the redirect.
- [Nuno Souto][souto] - still blogging from Sydney.
- [Daniel Fink][fink] - The Optimal DBA blog has been dropped with
  constraints cascaded - which is suboptimal.
- [Ed Whalen][whalen] - wrote a popular book in 2011, got rich on the
  proceeds and retired in the Caribbean.
