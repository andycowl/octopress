I forgot to pack my WordPress hosted

when
[moving](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/09/30/from-wordpresscom-to-wordpressorg/)
my blog. Thankfully, this isn't as important (or embarrassing) as
carefully packing and then promptly
[forgetting](http://radiofreetooting.blogspot.com/2006/11/ukoug-2006-day-one.html)
your suitcase when attending a week long conference away from home.

However, thanks to the Google image

my

has now been restored to its full
[glory](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/05/08/lwtua/).

Yesterday, I visited a customer in sunny Glasgow, near Scotland. This
was very poor planning on my part. I really should have delayed this
trip by 7 days which would have allowed me to gatecrash the Oracle
blogger
[meet-up](http://www.rittman.net/2006/10/18/blogger-meetup-ukoug-conference-tuesday-november-14th/)
at UKOUG.

In addition, returning to Glasgow on Tuesday 21 November would have
given me the opportunity to watch Celtic play United in a atmospheric
Glasgow hostelry sharing a pint of 'heavy' with some friendly Scottish
people.

Anyway, it's all about the customer so I flew up yesterday. As I landed,
I saw a small charter plane on the runway, ferrying a group of Scottish
Oracle bloggers to Birmingham. I knew it was a group of Oracle DBA's
from the name of the [airline](http://flydba.com/).

When I arrived at the office, the client was having a theme week to
coincide with 'I'm a (C-list) Celebrity. Get me out of here.' The lifts
were out of action and you had to clamber up a large
[beanstalk](http://flickr.com/photos/70276096@N00/297978033/) to get to
the meeting room on the fourth floor.

Scaling the beanstalk was quite a challenge and you had to acrobatically
leap onto a slippery white pole before finally reaching the balcony.
This task delayed the start of the architecture workshop by two hours
but the

from the top was well worth it.

We then adjourned for a delightful lunch of widgety grubs, fish eyes and
kangaroo testicles. Strange people, the Scots.
