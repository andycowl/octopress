Dear Reader

We had some great times on blogger together but all good things must
come to an end.

I just feel we need a break from each another. I need some time to
think and some personal space (on Wordpress) and there is no other ISP
involved. Please - believe me.

The Web site hits were bubbling up nicely, the feedburner circulation
peaked at 14 and we even had a couple of people referring to and
commenting on this blog.

However, unfortunately my owner's head has been turned by the use of
'categories', an RSS feed for 'Comments', trackback links which he
still doesn't understand and a new, trendy beta version of a blogging
platform used by the Scobleizer (and Eddie Awad) so he has dumped me
in favour of
[http://andyc.wordpress.com/](http://andyc.wordpress.com/)

Wordpress automatically provides a feed for the new blog from
[http://andyc.wordpress.com/feed/](http://andyc.wordpress.com/feed/)
and a separate feed for comments (which is a nice idea) -
[http://andyc.wordpress.com/comments/feed/](http://andyc.wordpress.com/comments/feed/)

My owner also deleted and recreated the Feedburner feed despite the
dire warnings (he was too stupid to fathom out the fancy
auto-redirection) so
[http://feeds.feedburner.com/AndyC](http://feeds.feedburner.com/AndyC)
may or may not still work or you might have to remove and recreate it.

After all we have been through, you still mean a lot to me and I hope
that we can still be good friends.

All my love
