Arsene Wenger is
[bleating](http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/6050848.stm)
about a referee who 'doesn't see things that exist'. This is the
ultimate irony from a man who, after 10 years, still constantly fails to
see things that do exist on a football pitch.

Thierry [Henry](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/05/18/priceless/)
is a superb footballer but should similarly be discouraged from giving
post-match interviews after a defeat. His moaning, whinging performance
almost rivalled his self-pitying rant following his dismal showing in
the European Cup Final.

Both men remind me of the junior football league my son plays in every
Saturday. Apart from the fact, those lads accept defeat with a good deal
more grace and dignity.
