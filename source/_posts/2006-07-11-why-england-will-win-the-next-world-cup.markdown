[HDTV](http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20060710/tc_nm/japan_matsushita_dc).
Robert [Scoble](http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/) is an intelligent chap
but has some truly bizarre thoughts. This
[theory](http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/2006/07/09/hdtv-will-make-soccer-a-lot-more-popular-in-america/)
is perhaps the most bizarre of all.

Playing is better than watching. Watching in the ground is better than
HDTV. HDTV is better than TV. Watching on TV is (sometimes) better than
listening on the radio.

To achieve success at 'soccer', you actually need to run around on a
field not slump in front of TV with four gallons of soda and a mountain
of cheesy nachos. If the latter was the criteria, England would surely
have lifted the last two World Cups and European Championships.
