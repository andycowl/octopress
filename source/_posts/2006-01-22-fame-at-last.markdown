For some reason, this blog now appears on
[One Million Blogs](http://www.onemillionblogs.net/), 
which is derived from the
[Million Dollar Homepage](http://www.milliondollarhomepage.com/)
that was in the news recently where a entrepeneurial UK student sold
advertising space on a Web page for a dollar for each pixel.

And the funny thing is I never even paid my dollar. It must be the
lovely image of the full moon (from the Regulus theme) that got me
noticed.

And just in case the Web page gets a lot fuller than it is now, fifth
from left on the second row.
