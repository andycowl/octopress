This is the first in a series of 'open letters' when I send emails to
people who I admire or have had a major influence on my life.

I will post my 'open letter' and subsequently will post the individual's
response (with their permission).

To kick things off, an open letter sent in February 2008 to [Tony
Hawks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hawks) (UK author, comedian and
occasional 'talking head' on those interminable BBC series that look
back to the 1980's).

Obviously, Tony has been very busy this year which must explain why I
haven't had the common courtesy of a reply (yet).

> Hi Tony

> You don't know me (I bet a lot of your emails and fan letters start

> I recognised you, you saw me staring at you and gave me a weak,

>
> I was considering coming up and introducing myself. However, I didn't
> for the following reasons:
>
> 1.  I had this awful mental image of stuttering 'Hi Tony. I've see you
>     on TV and I think you are quite funny' while you were trying to
>     query a mysterious charge on your hotel bill.
> 2.  My wife has never heard of you and would wonder why I was
>     accosting a complete stranger at the reception desk.
> 3.  I had to go to check on my two little children who were at loose
>     in the soft-play area.
>
> Anyway, I never did make it over and many years later, I still think
> you are quite funny and I have just finished 'Piano in the Pyrenees'
> which I thoroughly enjoyed. So much so I am immediately going to buy

> Tennis' and possibly 'One Hit Wonder').

> All the best, Andy
