...from Surrey Traffic Police. Unfortunately, my
[friends](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/02/15/undercover-with-surrey-traffic-police/)
appear to have sent me a 'Notice of Intended Prosecution' instead of
their customary Yuletide greetings card.

I wrote and told them I had been a very good boy all year long. Well, a
very good boy apart from my recent brush with their
[colleagues](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/11/21/a-brush-with-the-met/)
from the London branch.

Assuming Surrey Traffic Police content themselves with another fixed
penalty notice and 3 points, this is quite inconvenient for me as this
takes my tally to 9 points so I will now have to drive like an old man
wearing a trilby hat. This will last for a full seven months when my
current points start to expire.

I scrawled my own festive greeting on the non postage paid return
envelope which I hope I don't live to regret.
> 'Merry Xmas to all at Surrey Traffic Police. You are all doing a great
> job.'

So, if you are stuck behind me and wonder why is that idiot driving
below the speed limit, please accept my apologies but you can blame
Surrey Traffic Police.

Maybe I should hire this
[lady](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=503961&in_page_id=1770&in_page_id=1770&expand=true)
as my personal chauffeur.
