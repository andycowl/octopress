1.  The Fall - Hazel Grove Youth Club (1979) - 'We are The Fall. Rule
    One: no-one gets on stage. Rule Two: no spitting. Rule Three: no
    requests.'
2.  The Chameleons - Salford University (1984) - The Manchester gigs
    just seemed so much more manic.
3.  The Fall - Stockport College (1979) - Not so much a stage as a large
    step. Standing three feet away from a snarling Mark E. Smith and his
    carrier bag.
4.  The Chameleons - Gallery (1982) - Notable for a gigantic leap by
    skinhead from the gallery onto the dance floor. When we left, we
    found him lying semi-conscious on the pavement outside.
5.  The Fall - Manchester Poly (1980) - Compered by the late John Peel.
    Smith waded into the crowd to sort out a brave individual who doused
    him in lager.
6.  The Smiths - Brixton Academy (1986) - Little did we know it but
    turned out to be the final Smiths show. Morrissey walking on
    wielding 'The Queen is dead' placard. Pure theatre.
7.  The Smiths, The Fall and New Order - G-Mex (1986) - If The
    Chameleons had been present, my life would have been complete.
8.  The Fall - Walthamstow (1986) - 'Bend Sinister' tour with Brix and
    two drummers. So fantastic we went to Woolwich the next night.
9.  U2 - Warwick University Arts Centre (1981) - U2 blown away by an
    unknown support band; 'Hi - We're The Chameleons and we're from
    Manchester.'
10. The Chameleons - Shepherd's Bush Empire (2001) - Reunion gig - After
    14 long years, as if they had never been away.
11. The Fall - Lyceum Ballroom (1984) - sad to say, I went on my own and
    taped this show with a cheap Saisho walkman from Dixons.
