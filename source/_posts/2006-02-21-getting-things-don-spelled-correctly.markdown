When you find typos in Dave Allen's 'Getting Thing Done' book, it's a
little deflating.

Your mind which was starting to feel like smooth, unrippled water,
becomes more like a dripping tap.

Why, I haven't felt like this since I discovered Paul McKenna is losing
all his hair despite the power of mind over matter.

-   p46. 'At at' -\> 'And at'
-   p49. 'intution' -\> 'intuition'

Any may your God go with you.
