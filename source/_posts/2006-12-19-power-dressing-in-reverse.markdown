In the 1980's, some ladies chose to wear dark trouser suits and
blouses in an effort to match their male counterparts in the
workplace. This fad was known as
'[power dressing](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/2815859.stm)'.

One of my least favourite films is 'What Women Want' starring Mel
Gibson. I also thought Kurt Cobain looked pretty cool in a
[dress](http://youtube.com/watch?v=2UuZ848W51A) and Dave Grohl managed
to carry off wearing a bra (and a baseball cap) without looking
ridiculous.

So, in the interests of equality and as a concerted effort to break down
social and gender stereotyping, I decided to visit a client today
wearing a dress. It started out pretty well with several wolf-whistles
from builders on the way to the station.

However, it simply took me an age to arrange everything in the right
place to get my photograph taken for my visitors pass and people tended
to stare at me, look distractedly out of the window and avoid eye
contact (more than usual).

The whole exercise was a very interesting experiment but, suffice to
say, one that won't be repeated.

The disciplinary hearing is on Friday afternoon which also means I will
miss the Christmas party. Sigh.
