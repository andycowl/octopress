My post about Patrick Gibson reminded me of another Irish genius who,
sadly, is currently critcially ill in a London hospital.

A bell-boy was summoned to George Best's luxurious hotel room. He
stared in amazement at the scene that greeted him. Empty, discarded
bottles of champagne everywhere, a scantily clad Mary Stavin (Miss
World) lying on the bed surrounded by ten pound notes.
