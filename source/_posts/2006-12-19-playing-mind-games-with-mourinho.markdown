How the big clubs approach the problem...

Manchester United - Alex Ferguson chooses to invite Jose Mourinho to the
boardroom to share a bottle of expensive Portugese wine. Pointedly
applaud United fans who chant 'Your coat's from Matalan' on the way to
the tunnel. Then shut up and assemble a team that actually looks capable
of challenging Chelsea.

Liverpool - Appeal to the House of Lords, the Citizen's Advice Bureau
and the European Court of Human Rights after Mourinho has the audacity
and bare faced cheek to put his finger to his
[mouth](http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/league_cup/4312567.stm)
after a Chelsea goal in the Carling Cup Final. Hold a annual 5 minute
silence at Anfield for all those fans suffering post traumatic stress
disorder as a consequence.

Arsenal - Arsene

is so busy

[fisticuffs](http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/6141516.stm)
with small-time managers of small-time clubs, he forgets all about the
mind games. Go to the back of the class.

Everton - Take legal
[advice](http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/6188413.stm)
after Mourinho accuses your centre forward of falling over a little too
easily. Go running to your mummy in tears when this fails and everyone
laughs at you.
