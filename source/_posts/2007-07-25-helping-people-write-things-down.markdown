Today, a gentleman approached me and politely asked if he could ask me a
question.

Normally, this dialog is a little more protracted and goes as follows:
> 'Excuse me. Is your name Norman Brightside ?'
> 'Yes.'
>
> 'Do you work for Siebel ?'
>
> 'Yes.' (although strictly I work for Oracle on the Siebel CRM product)
>
> 'Are you from Expert Services ?'
>
> 'Yes.'
>
> 'Do you mind if I ask you a quick question ?'
>
> 'Not at all. Fire away.'

Anyway, what was unusual and striking about this approach was the fact
the gentleman was carrying a Reporters Notebook and a pen.

When we sat down to discuss the various strategies for gathering,
refreshing and (in obtuse cases), dropping statistics on objects in the
Siebel schema, he actually asked me if I minded pausing briefly while he
wrote things down.

I am not very clever. I am always writing things down mainly to avoid
forgetting them. I tend to gather a lot of data when I visit a customer.
Some of it is important, some of it is not. At first, it is not always
obvious which is which.

As I usually have to produce a formal report, I find it necessary and
useful to jot things down. My jottings are normally in a text file which
I take away with me as input into the report. This is another reason I
almost always exclusively use SQL\*Plus to script test cases and take
away a wad of spool files on a memory stick.

I am not overly organised. Sometimes, I may have a pristine pad of A4
paper but more often I am scribbling on the reverse of my flight/hotel
itinerary or a Google map.

If I am talking to a Siebel administrator, project manager, Oracle DBA,
in a meeting or a conference call or just chatting with an end user, I
will ensure I have a piece of paper available. Just to write things
down.

However, the fact I actually noticed this gentleman was equipped with a
pen and paper for our brief chat and also made notes and jottings,
merely served to reinforce how rare this seemingly obvious and eminently
sensible practice is.

Or am I just mixing in the wrong circles ?
