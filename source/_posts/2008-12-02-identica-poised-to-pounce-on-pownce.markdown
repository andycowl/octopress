[Pownce](http://pownce.com/) (a microblogging service) has been sold to
[SixApart](http://www.sixapart.com/blog/2008/12/welcome-pownce-team.html)
and decided to close the service on December 15 which is a nice early
Christmas present for all their users - both freeloaders (like me) and
'Pro' users who pay $20 per year.

Although I have a dormant Pownce [account](http://pownce.com/andycowl/),
I don't actively use the service. However, I find it odd that Pownce
have decided to close the service and provide all their users with just
two weeks notice to extract all their data and find another home.

The Pownce
[blog](http://blog.pownce.com/2008/12/01/goodbye-pownce-hello-six-apart/)
claims that:
> 'we believe we'll come back with something much better in 2009'

However, that 'belief' must be pretty weak and the date in 2009 must be
a long way away. Otherwise, why on earth would Pownce and SixApart force
all the existing Pownce users to evaluate and migrate to alternative
services if a viable, better alternative was being planned.

Will those users really come running back to SixApart after being kicked
out ? When they're already been forced to move once ? After the way
they've been treated ?

Surely, it would have been better to do what Google did with
[Jaiku](http://www.jaiku.com/). Absolutely nothing. Leave the service
exactly as it is with no fixes, no improvements, no additional services
or functionality. That way, the hardcore, diehard users will remain on
Pownce and, at least, you have a hope of getting those users converted
onto the new SixApart product (whenever it is available).
There are a few obvious choices for Pownce users:

-   [Twitter](http://twitter.com/) - more stability and increased uptime
    recently but limited to 140 characters (unlike Pownce) and inferior
    support for file sharing.
-   [Tumblr](http://www.tumblr.com/) - probably the closest match in
    terms of functionality (no 140 character limit, support for media
    posts (images, links, audio, videos)
-   [FriendFeed](http://friendfeed.com/) - includes most of Pownce
    functionality.
-   [identi.ca](http://identi.ca/) - micro-blogging service but
    OpenSource so the opportunity exists to run a separate Laconica
    instance for Pownce users and potentially support the Pownce API
    (and hence all existing desktop Pownce clients).
-   [Posterous](http://posterous.com/) - supports MP3, photos, audio
    files and posting by email.

In fact, identi.ca have already
[responded](http://controlyourself.ca/2008/12/01/congratulations-to-pownce/)
to the imminent demise of Pownce and started work on the ability to
import Pownce feeds into identi.ca and are actively looking for
developers to assist with providing a Pownce compatible API.

However, I suspect the main issues here for disillusioned Pownce users
aren't purely technical and won't necessarily depend on the advantages
and disadvantages of the alternative services. The key factor will
probably be the 'community' which has now been suddenly and forcibly
broken up.

I suspect most Pownce users are on Pownce for a reason - they like the
Pownce service and they like the community they have forged on Pownce.
Consequently, I suspect a significant number will simply migrate
wherever the majority of their friends go to or maintain multiple
presences.

I also suspect that most Pownce users may well have already considered
(and rejected) alternatives that were around (Twitter, Tumblr,
FriendFeed) when they originally chose to sign up with Pownce which may
be another positive factor in identi.ca's favour.
