Creating this blog was an experiment and, somewhat to my surprise, I
quite like the concept. So I have decided to host my blog on my Web
space over at blueyonder. This isn't because I think Telewest's
hosting service is any more reliable than blogger (never had any
issues at all with blogger) but so I can peruse the Web server logs
and referrer statistics that Blueyonder kindly gather for me. The
transfer of the blog went surprisingly smoothly and I created a
placeholder blog to grab the old namespace on blogger.
