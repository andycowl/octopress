I once sat on an interview panel. Each interviewer would briefly
summarise the strengths and weaknesses of each candidate and a decision
would be made by consensus.

However, for one candidate, the first interviewer simply said 'No'.

'OK David. Thank you. John, anything to add to that ?'

John: 'Absolutely no.'

And that was the end of that.
