A great weekend for the middle-aged, barstool musical correspondent.

[Music](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vikb0rGosyI) and
[chat](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aj9EpMXarrY&mode=related&search=)
from Iggy and The Stooges on Jonathan Ross. I never realised
'[Elves](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Fall/_/Elves)' by The Fall was
such a complete rip-off of 'I wanna be your dog'.

[Seven Ages of Rock](http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/sevenages/programmes/left-of-the-dial/)
- Black Flag, R.E.M, Pixies and Nirvana.

> 'It had to end right there. Right with that scream. Right with that
> song. Right with that howl' - Scott Litt on Kurt Cobain's final
> [words](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVCqQmoHg8s) on 'Where Did You
> Sleep Last Night'

> 'If I could change anything, I just wish that Kurt was still alive.' -
> Dave Grohl

[Glastonbury](http://www.bbc.co.uk/glastonbury/) - Arctic Monkeys, The
Killers, The Editors and a fantastic set from Iggy and the Stooges. Raw
power.
