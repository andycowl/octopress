Some of the varied and bizarre [keyword
searches](http://nbrightside.com/blog/2008/11/18/more-fun-with-keyword-searches)
leading visitors to this site merely confirm this blog is the
ramblings of a confused madman. Here is a selection from the start of
the year

-   'dyslexic blog' - curiously spelled correctly.
-   'crucifixion blog' - listen United are in debt and suffering a dip
    in form but don't do anything hasty now.
-   'why linux will never' - come on, you simply can't leave me dangling
    like that.
-   'breasts chessington' - hoping your mates didn't publish that photo
    of you, on the log flume, flashing your assets.
-   'brightside software enterprises friendorfoe' - stealth marketing
    finally starts to pay off.
-   'famous captive animals' - Skippy (the bush kangaroo) and Lassie.
-   'handsworth exoctic escort' - there's absolutely nothing exotic
    about Handsworth, trust me.
-   'hoax messages on friends reunited' - the ghost of the cruel,
    heartless [Janet
    Oldsgate](http://nbrightside.com/blog/2005/12/09/probably-the-best-phish-in-the-world)
    strikes again.
-   'how can i get back my lost virginity' - please send an
    international money order for &pound;250 to PO Box 729.
-   'life has dealt me with a cruel card' - don't tell me, hang on. Was
    it the '8 of Diamonds' ?
-   'my car keeps cutting out and the bonnet is steaming' - stop
    blogging immediately and call The AA.
-   'pubsubhubbub is a lot easier than it sounds' - easy for you to say.
-   'the balls of allah explosive underpants' - priceless. What a
    superlative name for a blog/album/house/dog !
-   'what do you think is the most important decision in our life' -
    Will these underpants last another day ?
-   'fucking overlapping partitions when im installing linux' -
    language, Timothy. Nice assumption that the swear word would be
    included in relevant posts
