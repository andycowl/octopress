Diamond Geezer recently posted his annual [analysis][1] of how many
blogrolls he appears in. Unsurprisingly, perhaps, the number is
steadily declining and he finds it harder to find new blogs to add to
his list.

I thought it might be interesting to look at the blogging platforms
used by the 98 blogs listed. Here are the results:

- Blogger 60
- WordPress.com 11
- WordPress.org 11
- Typepad 4
- MovableType 3
- Livejournal 2
- Canalblog 1
- Drupal 1
- ExpressionEngine 1
- Nucleus CMS 1
- Serendipity 1
- Guardian (journo) 1
- Custom 1

The dominance of Blogger/Blogspot didn't surprise me that much. I have
noticed before that it's very popular amongst UK bloggers;
particularly veteran bloggers who maybe had less choice avaiable that
the plethora of options available today.

Which blogging platform do you use and why ?
