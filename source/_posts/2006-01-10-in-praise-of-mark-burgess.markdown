A long time ago, there was a unique band called
[The Chameleons](http://www.thechameleons.com/)
who hailed from Middleton, Manchester.

Like a lot of bands, The Chameleons made some records, built up a
dedicated following, played lots of gigs and then split up.

Like a lot of bands, The Chameleons reformed.

Like a lot of bands, The Chameleons made some more records, played some
more gigs and then split up (again).

However, unlike a lot of bands, the lead singer, Mark Burgess, once went
to a private individual's house and played at their birthday
[party](http://web.ukonline.co.uk/nutts/invincible/party.htm).

Now, I don't like to namedrop but I met Mark Burgess once. It was just
before a gig at The Garage in Highbury. I had a very brief chat about
his life in Hamburg, United's prospects against Bayer Leverkeusen in the
semi, ticket sales and whether he could put me on the guest list.

Years before that, I also had an email exchange with him. I forget most
of the details but will always remember his response to my 'God - it
really was you' which was 'Please don't call me God, plain Mark will
do'.
