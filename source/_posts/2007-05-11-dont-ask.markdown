Many years ago, in a parallel universe, I created a
[Web](http://web.archive.org/web/20010525033911/http://www.andy-cowling.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/)
page that proclaimed:
> 'The fastest, most comprehensive Web search engine -
> [AltaVista](http://www.altavista.com/)'

With the increasing domination of
[Google](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/10/30/the-only-search-engine-in-town/),
it really is difficult to remember life back in the days when AltaVista
was the only search engine in town and you were even considering sinking
500 quid of your hard-earned into the rumoured
[IPO](http://www.itweek.co.uk/vnunet/news/2112349/altavista-europe-hints-ipo).
Maybe one day, another startup will come along and usurp Google's \#1
position but somehow, I sincerely doubt it.

And if that search engine company turns out to be
[Ask](http://uk.ask.com), I hereby pledge to eat my underpants and buy
everyone a season ticket at Manchester City (with complimentary powder
blue and white scarf).

Duncan Riley of TechCrunch already posted an excellent
[summary](http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/05/04/ask-is-the-algorithm-working/)
on Ask's current, abysmal marketing campaign in the UK.

Listen, if you want to get ordinary people to use your search engine,
don't use some subtle, understated, pretentious campaign ('Evolve Your
Search') with pictures of Neanderthal man, costing millions of dollars,
dreamt up by new media luvvies, wearing black shirts and no ties.

Ordinary people don't say: 'Ooh - that looks very interesting indeed. I
wonder if that advert is a cryptic reference to a new, exciting search
engine technology which will undoubtedly to help me find relevant stuff
quickly on the Interweb. The Ask brand has now been subconsciously
planted in my mind and I simply must remember to discuss this topic with
the lads at work tomorrow.'

Ordinary people say: 'God there's some rubbish adverts on TV these days.
Fancy a cup of tea, love ?'

Believe it or not, technically minded people have already heard of Live,
Ask and Google and all those
[niche](http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/the_top_100_alt_search_engines_april07_update.php)
search engine players (incorporating Web 2.0 semantics).

Believe it or not, those technically minded people are in a tiny
minority. They don't know it but they are.

You are not trying to get their attention. There's no point. They look
down their nose at you. The only time they use Ask.com is the final
choice to determine how many inbound links their tiresome blog has this
week.

No, you are trying to get the attention of millions of desperate
housewives, builders and silver surfers who have never heard of Google
and have to ask their 12 year old son to dig up that Web site for
holiday cottages in the Dordorgne. These people don't use IE7 and type
their searches directly into the address bar.

A much better campaign would have been:
> 'Trying to find something on the Internet ? Go to ask.com.'

Black text on white background. Short and to the point. Quicker and
therefore considerably cheaper and it probably would have delivered
better results than this
[report](http://www.marketingpilgrim.com/2007/05/google-market-share-up-again.html)
from Hitwise suggests .

Well, let's face it - my campaign couldn't have been much worse; 3.69%
market share and a staggering 13% down year on year). Come on Ask, only
another 62% before you overtake Google.

So, don't Ask, just Google. Like everyone else.
