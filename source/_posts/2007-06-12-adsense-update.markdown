After a promising start, the recent introduction of
[Adsense](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/05/23/sit-back-and-watch-the-money-roll-in/) on this
blog is seriously floundering. I am bitterly disappointed with the
financial returns in June and my wife is seriously doubting the wisdom
of my decision to resign from a highly paid job in IT consultancy in
favour of professional blogging on the kitchen table.

Consequently, after an extraordinary board meeting, I have decided that
desperate measures are necessary. I have cashed in my &pound;12.50
[Adwords](http://adwords.google.com) vouchers bundled with my Bluehost
account and launched a brilliant, inspired, marketing campaign aimed at
driving traffic to this site, increasing e-commerce sales and boosting
the click through rate.

So, if you see the following Google advertisement on your travels
through the InterWeb, please be sure to let me know.
