...have a lot in common.

I was interested to read that [David
Beckham](http://www.ocdcentre.com/pages/articles.htm) suffers from
[OCD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCD) and simply can not abide an odd
number of ~~lines~~ cans of coke in his fridge

I have a similar obsession about cans of Grolsch in my fridge. 0, 2, 4,
8 but never 1, 3, 5, 6 or 7. If we ever get an odd number, I simply
~~drink 'em~~ scold the offenders soundly and banish them to the
cupboard (where odd numbers only are allowed).

Similarly, rounds in the pub simply must be equalized by close of
drinking otherwise I come out in an angry, red rash.

I also must practice free kicks and penalties for 7 hours a day until I
actually score one before I go home for my tea. So when England exit the
World Cup on penalties in the quarter finals (again), it certainly won't
be my fault.

If the hoovering is not done, then I immediately summon my army of maids
to do it before I can even contemplate sitting down for my tea with Posh
and the kids.

Now, did I put the
[gerbils](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/03/21/a-narrow-escape/)
out ?
