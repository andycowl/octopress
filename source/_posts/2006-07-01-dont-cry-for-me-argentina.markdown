You were good but not that good otherwise you wouldn't have needed extra
time against Mexico and would have beaten the Germans in two hours of
football.

Still, at least this will finally end to the (UK) media love-in about
your fanastic football and the two best goals scored ever. You know; the
one with 24 passes in the buildup and that superb, dipping volley.

Refreshing to see Gabriel Heinze attacking FIFA officials instead of
lying on the turf and sobbing uncontrollably which is the proper way to
face defeat in a penalty shootout.
