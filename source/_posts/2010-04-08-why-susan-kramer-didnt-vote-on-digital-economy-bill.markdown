title: why Susan Kramer didn't vote on Digital Economy Bill
layout: post

Short answer - She was in a meeting. I sent a polite email asking why my
MP Susan Kramer failed to vote last night on the third reading of the
Digital Economy Bill.

> Dear Mrs Kramer

> Many thanks for taking the time to send me a long and detailed
> letter is response to my email inquiry about your stance on the
> Digital Economy Bill.

> You're right - it's a very complex issue and may yet be subject to
> refinements before it finally becomes law.

> However, as you seemed to support the bill but oppose certain
> clauses, I was curious to find which way you voted last night in
> Parliament at the bill's third reading.

> From reviewing
> [Hansard](http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm/cmtoday/cmdebate/32.htm),
> it appears you couldn't be bothered to vote at all. Which disgusts
> me.

> You've just lost another vote in the forthcoming general election.

I then received this response

> Thank you for all you emails regarding the Digital Economy Bill. Susan
> has asked me to respond on her behalf and I hope you don't mind my
> doing so. Please accept my apologies for the group email but we have
> received so many emails on this issue that it is the only way I will
> be able to respond to you all today.

> First of all let me assure you that this is a very important issue
> to Susan and the rest of the Parliamentary Lib Dem party and she
> takes your views very seriously.

> The Government has been intent on forcing through the Digital
> Economy Bill through the â€˜wash up' as they believed it would face
> less opposition with many MP's having already left Parliament for
> their constituencies. The Government was so desperate to get this
> Bill through in fact that they pulled DCMS Minister Ben Bradshaw off

> Bills going through the wash up are usually done in a more secretive

> As many of you may be aware the Liberal Democrats were completely

> We were unaware that there was going to be a vote on the Bill until

Words fail me. *We were unaware that there was going to be a vote on the
Bill until only an hour beforehand.*

Great. That really reassures me that you are on top of things. 

*Hopefully Susan will be re-elected.*

There's more chance of Manchester United winning the Champions League
that Susan Kramer securing my vote.
