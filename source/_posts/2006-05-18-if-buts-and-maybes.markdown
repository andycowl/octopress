With apologies to Mr. [Kipling](http://www.kipling.org.uk/poems_if.htm)
(who does bake exceedingly good cakes) and Tele Savalas

'If' - a poem by Arsene Wenger of North London.

> If UEFA had changed the rules of football for all games played on 17
> May 2006 
> If the referee hadn't been a Barcelona supporter 
> If the idiotic, Norwegian linesman had been allowed to officiate and
> flag the first goal offside 
> If Lehman had still been on the pitch, he would have saved both goals 
> If D'Artagnan had been allowed to stay on the pitch 
> If the Barca goalkeeper hadn't tipped Lundberg's shot over the bar 
> If poor Thierry hadn't been so tired, he would have definitely scored
> that goal

Or, as we say back home

'If my Auntie had bollocks, she would be my Uncle.'
