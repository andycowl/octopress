title: stampede at London Waterloo

Last night, I was standing at London Waterloo station, sincerely hoping
that the engineer would be able to fix the carriages for my train home.

Suddenly, there was a stampede of people rushing past me. What on earth
was happening ? Was this some spontaneous act of flash mobbing ? Had a
train arrived unexpectedly at platform 4 for those impatient people from
Basingstoke ? Or was there some sort of inaudible terrorist alert
mumbled by the station announcer that I had missed ?

The answer transpired to be none of the above.

Krispy Kreme Doughnuts were giving out free samples to promote the
opening of a new outlet.

A gentlemen in a suit gleefully came away clutching not one but two
large (pizza style) boxes. He also had a can of Stella Artois poking out
of his pocket. Bizarre.
