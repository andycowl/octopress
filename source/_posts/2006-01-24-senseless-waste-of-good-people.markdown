Mark Burgess once introduced 'Here Today' with these words.

I just read on [The Chameleons](http://www.thechameleons.com/) message
board that Mancunian musician, [Bryan
Glancy](http://www.music-dash.co.uk/news/news.asp?item=1283), died at
the weekend. I didn't know Bryan Glancy. I never met Bryan Glancy. I
just happened to see him supporting The Chameleons in Camden back in
November 2002. Just very sad for his friends and family to think of
another young person gone before his time.

Elsewhere, four young people are convicted of manslaughter (not murder)
for kicking a man to
[death](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/london/4637382.stm)
in a random attack on London's South Bank.

A person isn't safe anywhere these days.
