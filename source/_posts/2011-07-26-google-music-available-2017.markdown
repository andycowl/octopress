A few weeks ago, I signed up for a invitation to Google Music. The
service is only available in the US but, by a lucky chance of fate, I
just happened to be connected to my corporate VPN so I was successful
and an invitation duly arrived in my Inbox.

Initially, the Google Music Manager software didn't support Linux. Nor
was the Ogg Vorbis audio format supported so I didn't pursue it any
further as both of these were show stoppers for me. I don't intend
re-ripping my entire music collection to MP3 format.

However, last week, Google released a Linux version of Music Manager
and added
'[support](http://www.google.com/support/music/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=1100462&topic=1100183)'
for Ogg format audio files. The 'support' for the Ogg format is
slightly strange - Ogg audio files will be transcoded back to 320kps
MP3 files which represents a conversion from one lossy format to
another lossy format. Hopefully, in the longer term, there will be
true native support for Ogg.

Anyway, I downloaded the Music Manager software and started uploading
my music collection mainly so I could listen to music on my netbook
which currently runs [Chromium OS](http://chromeos.hexxeh.net/).

I started the upload 2 days ago and it's been running during the
day. So far, it has managed to upload 505 songs out of a total 1,880
so it's not exactly a speedy process.
