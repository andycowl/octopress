Hi Rupert. Yes - I am pretty open minded about my career and would
consider anything apart from pole dancing. Norman.

Rupert - I typed 'ping rupert' but my computer reported an error 'rupert
is not responding'. Kind regards, Norman

Hey Rupert I don't wish to be rude but I think I'd rather be considered
for the 'pole dancing' role. Do you have any such openings for tasteful
pole dancing - maybe at corporate events for IT companies. Although I
relatively new to the business, I do have a copy of 'The Full Monty' on
DVD. Does that help ? Norman

Rupert - My notice period is one month but I wouldn't be available for
any new role until 1 September when I get out of hospital - Norman.

Rupert - Please don't worry - it's just some minor surgery I'm having
done in Belarus. It the fourth and final part of my transgender
operation. From 1 September, I will be henceforth be known as
'Norma-Jeane'. This will most certainly affect my package and strong
pain killers will be required. Do you want an updated CV now to forward
to the client ? Thanks, Norman.

Rupert - please don't act like a bear with yellow trousers, red jumper
and a sore head. I had a chat with my 'life coach' last night and we
decided that the time is ripe for a fresh, new challenge. I need to be
excited when I when I go to work. I need to be stretched (but gently). I
need to be stimulated again (but gently). Therefore, I am now looking
for a Linux system administration role or exotic dancing. Ideally, full
time Linux Sys Admin for a charity and part-time dancing at night. The
main reason for the transgender process was the increased earning
potential available to female strippers. This will enable me to get
enough money together for the 'pole dancing' classes. Please let me know
- Norman.

Yes - but only before 1 September.
