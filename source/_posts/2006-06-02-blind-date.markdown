Against my better
[judgement](http://www.blogherald.com/2006/05/28/share-your-opml-as-a-blog-metric/)
(see solitary comment), I uploaded my static list of feeds and RSS
subscriptions to Share Your [OPML](http://share.opml.org/).

'Subscriptions like Mine' tells me that my love match (with an
impressive strength rating of 36.371) is none other than, Number 1,
Eddie [Awad](http://awads.net/wp/).

The wedding is on Saturday July 22. Please, no presents. All donations
to charity.

Obviously all loyal readers of this humble blog (from August 2005 with
proof) are all invited. The remainder (Johnny Come Lately's) are on the
reserve list (i.e evening reception only).
