Bluehost have upgraded WordPress to 2.0.5 so I ignored this warning and
clicked 'Upgrade'
> Click on Upgrade only if 
>  - no files, languages, themes have been modified 
>  - you haven't added mods to this installation of WordPress

After all, the whole point of hosting a blog is to add
[plugins](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/10/16/couple-of-useful-wordpress-plugins/)
and
[modify](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/10/10/improving-on-perfection/)
themes.

I find it slightly odd that Bluehost have no blog or other means of
communicating the availability of these upgrades.

Let's see if posting still works.
