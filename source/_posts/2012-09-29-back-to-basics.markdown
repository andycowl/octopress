Frustrated at the inability of Google to provide a simple sync process
that works for disparate versions of Chrome and Chromium browsers, I
decided to adopt a pragmatic approach, return to Victorian values and
go back to using a Web based bookmarks service.

Way back, in 2005, I [evaluated][1] three different bookmarking
services and dismissed [Delicious][2], mainly on the grounds of the
user interface design of the home page which, according to me, 'looks
like an undergraduate knocked it up during a lunch hour'. This was a
little rich from someone with no design experience whatsoever but
still.

Seven years have passed though and now my requirements are slightly
different. I use three different computers (desktop, work laptop and
netbook) and different Web browsers (Firefox and Chromium). In
addition, I consume content (Google Reader, Google Plus and identi.ca)
on an Android phone so the requirement is for a reliable Chromium
extension, Firefox addon and Android application, that simply supports
posting and searching, for the bookmarking service.

In the intervening period, I had also played with [diigo][3] and this
service is still available but leaning towards a Premium model (free
basic service with paid for add ons and additional features).

All the cool cats currently tend to favour [Pinboard][4] which has a
simple business model - a one-off fee that gradually increases as more
users join the service. The current fee stands at $9.90 but I can
hardly justify that for what is essentially a private dump of
bookmarks as I would make limited use of the sharing and discovery
elements.

So that was easy - delicious was aquired and subsequently sold by
Yahoo! and have thankfully lost the silly del.icio.us name which now
simply redirects to delicious.com.

I am using the following delicious tools:

- [Delicious Tools][5] for Chrome/Chromium
- [Delicious Post][6] for Firefox
- [DeliciousDroid][7] for Android

Sorted.
