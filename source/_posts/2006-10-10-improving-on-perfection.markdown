The [Barthelme](http://www.plaintxt.org/themes/barthelme/) theme for
[WordPress](http://wordpress.org/) is close to absolute perfection.

My only minor reservation is that elements of the sidebar (Pages,
Categories, Recent Comments) and the title of the Next/Previous posts
appear in UPPER case.

This is one of my pet hates as it looks like SHOUTING which is RUDE and,
IMHO (sic), is completely at odds with the
[minimalist](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/08/04/minimalism-begins-in-nepal/),
understated feel of the theme.

However, a quick edit in 'style.css' to change two occurences of
'text-transform: none;' to 'text-uppercase: none;' fixed that.

My life is now complete. All that remains is to add 'CSS' to my CV.
