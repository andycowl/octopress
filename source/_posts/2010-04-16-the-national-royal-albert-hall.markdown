One of my favourite bands is American beat combo - [The
National](http://www.americanmary.com/). I will forever be indebted to
[Michael](http://twofishcreative.com/michael/blog/) for introducing me
to the band.

Yesterday, I received an email that said a handful of tickets for the
sold out gig at the Royal Albert Hall on 6 May in London would be
going on sale today at 3pm. These tickets were originally 'being held
for lighting, sound and film equipment (for a possible filming of the
performance) that we have decided to pull.'

I didn't hold out much hope but am delighted to say I have just
secured a ticket.

The National have a new album '[High
Violet](http://www.highviolet.com/)' coming out on May 11. It's rather
difficult (and pointless) trying to categorise the band's music (try
listening to 'Boxer' yourself) but I really like Matt Berninger's
voice and lyrics.

There's a free download of 'Bloodbuzz Ohio' available and here's a
video of my favourite song, 'Terrible Love' (also from 'High Violet').
