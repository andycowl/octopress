...is the sincerest form of flattery.

I note [Tom Kyte](http://tkyte.blogspot.com/2006/04/around-london.html)
is shamelessly copying my exciting and innovative
[photoblog](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/04/18/birth-of-a-photo-blog/)
idea but appears to using a slightly more expensive camera.

Pity I was not able to attend Tom's 2 day
[seminar](http://education.oracle.com/pls/web_prod-plq-dad/show_desc.redirect?redir_type=3&p_org_id=28&lang=US)
in London. That would have been very interesting. Maybe next time.
