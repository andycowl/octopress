Rooney will (and should not) play no part whatsoever. He should not even
travel.

Eriksson should play 4-5-1 with Owen upfront if fit. Otherwise Defoe.

Midfield of Gerrard, Lampard, Cole and Beckham with Carrick in holding
role.

Eriksson has absolutely nothing to lose. He is leaving so why should he
give a hoot what the public/media think.

However, he will care and will play Crouch/Owen upfront with a lop-sided
midfield and England will be lucky to get out of the group stages.
