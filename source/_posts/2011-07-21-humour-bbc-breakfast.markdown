BBC Breakfast ran a story this morning about the sale of
[woodlands](http://www.woodlands.co.uk/buying-a-wood/). The gentlemen
responsible for selling woodlands was quite a comedian. He started his
act with:

> 'In these difficult economic times, people are looking to invest in
> woodlands to hedge their bets...'

and then, referring to the potential investment opportunity and
without a glimmer of a smile, he delivered the immaculate line

> 'In a few years time, once the wood has matured, people will see
> that you can get income from trees'.
