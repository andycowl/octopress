title: chaos on the streets on Newcastle

The streets of the fine city of Newcastle were gridlocked on Monday.
Locals despaired as their normal 20 minute commute took 3 hours 40
minutes due to a series of unfortunate events.

-   A public sector strike (against pensions) closing the Metro and a
    tunnel under the Tyne.
-   An attention-seeking individual pretending he wanted to end his life
    by jumping off a lofty bridge which meant the closure of the bridge,
    more traffic chaos and 57 social workers being summoned.
-   Another (suspicious) fire in the city.

I owe my eternal gratitude to my taxi driver who meekly suggested that I
might like to consider walking 10 minutes (instead of sitting for a
further 90 minutes with the meter running) back to my hotel.

Would that happen in London ? Probably not.
