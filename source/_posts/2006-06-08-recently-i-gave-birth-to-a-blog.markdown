...and it really hurt.

I continue to be intrigued by this
[article](http://hersheysiniceincream.blogspot.com/2006/06/recently-i-give-rise-to-website.html)
(I have now read it 67 times and still can't make any sense of it
whatsoever). I simply love the title so I thought I would blatantly
plagiarise it. I also adore the Anonymous comments of 'Not bad' and
'Nice job'. Damned with faint praise.

Anyway, my shiny new [blog](http://factory51.blogspot.com/) in question
is over here. Before you gleefully note that I have finally seen the
light and have reverted to Blogger, this is simply an experiment to look
at the Google [Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/) dashboard
and various detailed traffic reports. [GA requires Javascript which
precludes its use on WordPress.com]. Inevitably, after a separation of
six months, Blogger was sulking and unavailable last night.

Q: What is the significance of the name 'Factory51' ? Answers on a
postcard to /dev/null.
