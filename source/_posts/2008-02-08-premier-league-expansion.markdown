'Every club knows they will have an equal chance of being treated
unfairly.'

from Richard Scudamore (Chief Executive Premier League)

The proposal is for an additional competitive Premier League fixture to
be played around the world. Although the top 5 clubs will be seeded,
this still allows for the possibility of United drawing Derby at home
(in Beijing) while Arsenal visit Liverpool (in Los Angeles).
