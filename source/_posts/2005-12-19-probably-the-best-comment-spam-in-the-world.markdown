title: probably the best comment spam in the world
layout: post

The Akismet spam filter included with WordPress.com means I am not
troubled by comment spam on my blog at all, ever.

However, I recently reviewed the spam sitting there all alone in
quarantine. Most was inviting me to sample all sorts of delights
describing all manner of different and very imaginative ways that a man
and (wo)man can be joined together.

One spam comment stood out head and shoulders above all others though
with a blissfully simple but effective, marketing message.
