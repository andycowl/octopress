Norton Internet Security

Our love affair began back in the days of running a cable across my
bedroom for my meagre dialup connection and the protection (Firewall,
Virus Checker) you offered. After that. I felt obliged to renew my
subscription every July.

Each new version looked very similar and you hardly ever notified me of
viruses or security breaches. Maybe you eliminated them all ruthlessly
and silently but for 35 GBP per year, you need to 'add value'.

Tonight, I was shocked to discover that your 'CCPROXY.EXE' application
was consuming more than half my paltry 512 MB of memory and spinning the
CPU at 100% when I am trying to watch important music
[videos](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/07/18/music-nostalgia/).

I wouldn't mind but that is with 'Norton Internet Security' disabled !

So, farewell then, Norton Internet Security/AntiVirus. Thanks to [Tim
Hall](http://www.oracle-base.com/blog/), I am now using the freely
available
[AVG](http://www.oracle-base.com/blog/2006/04/07/pc-support-tips/) and
the firewall provided with my Linksys wireless
[router](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/04/17/more-wireless-fun/).
