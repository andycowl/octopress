Recently I collected Norma-Jean from one of her hobbies. As we departed,
I stopped to bid farewell to a couple of boys who were preparing to
cycle home: 'See you next time, lads.'

'Dad - why did you have to say goodbye to those boys ?'

'Well I see them here twice a week so I was just being friendly...'

'God - that was so embarrassing. I actually thought you were going to
say 'Cheerio' as usual'.

There followed a brief discussion on the list of all possible farewell
greetings and the acceptability of each. Then we reached the car. She
put her iPod on, I listened to the radio and the matter was closed.

Until the following week. We left the sports centre where the same two
lads were unlocking their bikes. I paused. My daughter stopped and
looked at me in stupefied horror as I waited for the lads' full
attention.
