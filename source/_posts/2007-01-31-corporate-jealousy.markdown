I always smile whenever I receive an email that opens 'I heard that
Stephen Hawksworth Smithers-Jones in ABC division gets...'

Over the years I have heard the following myths about the delights of
working in the completely fictional division ABC.

-   Unlimited broadband paid for by the company.
-   Mandatory business class flights on short-haul.
-   Complimentary chauffeur service from your house to LHR/LGW.
-   Expenses automatically paid via psychic medium with no need for
    receipts.
-   No need for approvals for anything from anyone.
-   Prawn volavons with a garlic and tomato sauce brought to their desks
    at 12 noon precisely (even when onsite).
-   First shout on the airplane toilet when the seat-belts sign is
    extinguished.
-   Free laundry and ironing service when onsite for more than one night
-   New laptops every quarter (subject to stringent personal, divisional
    and corporate performance goals). Every month otherwise.
-   Complimentary invites to the client's Christmas bash and summer BBQ
    (free bar and partners included).
-   Secret inclusion in the company car ('Gold - Level 3') scheme with
    access to a brand new model every 3 months.
-   A massive incentive payment to not to desert to main rival during
    any (rumoured) takeover.
-   2.6 million shares, 1.2 million stock options and 876,542
    FlexPoints. Index linked.
-   Contributory pension scheme; Company contributes 24 times salary.
    Employee contributes nothing.

It always reminds me of the advert: 'Carlsberg don't run an IT
consultancy, but if they did, it would be like this...'
