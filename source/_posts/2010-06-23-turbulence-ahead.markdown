I am about to embark on migrating this blog from WordPress to
Django-Mingus because I simply can't stand the WordPress 'Compose Post'
interface (if you can call it that).

This exciting move comes less than two weeks after I spotaneously
decided to ditch Habari after the lack of a functional 'Auto-Save'
plugin caused me to lose 17 minutes work.

You may say 'I'm reading this in my preferred RSS reader so please don't
bother me with such minutiae'.

However, when I migrated from Habari to WordPress a month ago, I flooded
you both with my most recent posts duplicated so this is just prior
warning that similar oddness may well occur as I endeavour to hook up
the new blog feed to FeedBurner.

This may or may not signal a period of blog hopping and I'd like to say
this ~~will~~ may trigger a series of interesting posts about which
blogging platforms I considered and discarded and top tips on planning
and executing an efficient blog migration.
