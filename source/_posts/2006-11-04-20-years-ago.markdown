4 November 1986. League Cup 3rd round replay. Attendance 17,914.

Southampton 4  Manchester United 1 (Davenport).

Ron Atkinson's last game in charge and I was there. The United team 
that night was:

-   Chris Turner
-   Mike Duxbury
-   Arthur Albiston
-   Paul McGrath
-   Graeme Hogg
-   Remi Moses
-   Jesper Olsen
-   Norman Whiteside
-   Frank Stapleton
-   Peter Davenport
-   Colin Gibson
-   Subs: Kevin Moran, Nicky Wood

I was partly responsible for Ron Atkinson's departure. The seeds were 
sown the previous season when United won the opening 10 games of the 
1985-1986 season, fueling expectation that United might actually win 
the title. However, I was foolish enough to attend game number 11. 
Inevitably, that game was a 1-1 draw at Luton and ended the run. United 
finished 4th that season behind Liverpool and the writing was on the wall 
for Ron Atkinson.

Favourite Ferguson quote: 'My greatest challenge is not what's happening 
at the moment, my greatest challenge was knocking Liverpool right off 
their fucking perch. And you can print that.'
