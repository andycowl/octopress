4 November 1986. League Cup 3rd round replay. Attendance 17,914.
</p>
<p>
Southampton 4  Manchester United 1 (Davenport).
</p>
<p>
Ron Atkinson's last game in charge and I was there. The United team that night was:
<ul>
<li>Chris Turner</li>
<li>Mike Duxbury</li>
<li>Arthur Albiston</li>
<li>Paul McGrath</li>
<li>Graeme Hogg</li>
<li>Remi Moses</li>
<li>Jesper Olsen</li>
<li>Norman Whiteside</li>
<li>Frank Stapleton</li>
<li>Peter Davenport</li>
<li>Colin Gibson</li>
<li>Subs: Kevin Moran, Nicky Wood</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
I was partly responsible for Ron Atkinson's departure. The seeds were sown the previous season when United won the opening 10 games of the 1985-1986 season, fueling expectation that United might actually win the title. However, I was foolish enough to attend game number 11. Inevitably, that game was a 1-1 draw at Luton and ended the run. United finished 4th that season behind Liverpool and the writing was on the wall for Ron Atkinson.

Favourite Ferguson quote: 'My greatest challenge is not what's happening at the moment, my greatest challenge was knocking Liverpool right off their fucking perch. And you can print that.'
