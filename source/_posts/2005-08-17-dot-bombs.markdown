Returned from holiday to find correspondence lying on my doorstep from
two internet companies. Both were big names and continually in the news
during the internet boom in 1999.

Firstly, two cheques resulting from travelocity's takeover of
lastminute.com. Back in 2000, I applied to buy shares in lastminute.com
for me, my wife, my auntie and my dog. Thankfully, the share offering
was massively oversubscribed and I only received the minimum allocation
which reduced my subsequent losses five years later. In fact, the
lastminute takeover was very timely as I had two separate, small
shareholdings which I was stuck with as dealing costs would have
swallowed up most of the proceeds.

Secondly, a thick wad of legalese all the way from the United States of
America regarding a class action by shareholders (and corporate lawyers)
against Amazon. I couldn't be bothered to read all the twenty seven
pages of small print but the gist appeared to be that people bought
shares expecting to become dollar millionaires overnight and,
unsurprisingly, were bitterly disappointed when this failed to
materialise. Remember, people, the price of shares can go down as well
as up. If you want to become a dollar millionaire, don't buy shares
become a corporate lawyer.
