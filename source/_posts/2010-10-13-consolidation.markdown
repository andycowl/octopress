Occasionally, I have posted stuff on Posterous and Tumblr because I
didn't really feel it â€˜belonged' on this blog, it wasn't worthy or it
was a throwaway one-liner and not a proper blog post. As I subsequently
deleted my Posterous account (as I didn't like their [negative
campaigning][] against Tumblr), some of this content has now been lost
forever.

I think, from now on, I will post everything on this blog where it's
under my control.
