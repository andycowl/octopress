[trip](http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/2005/12/02/guinness-anyone/) to
the Guinness brewery reminds me of a similar visit I enjoyed many years
ago with a few friends.

After enduring the 45 minute tour of the Dublin brewery, we finally
settled back to enjoy the free samples which were willingly dispensed in
1/2 pint glasses of sheer perfection.

After a while (seven halves), I sensed the barmaid was about to ask
'Shouldn't you lads be moving on now ?' but one of our party got in
first with 'Have you not got any pint glasses back there ?'
