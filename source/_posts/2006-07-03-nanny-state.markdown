Golly. It is very hot today. Thankfully, the UK
[Government](http://www.met-office.gov.uk/weather/europe/uk/heat_health.html)
has told me the solution:

> Stay out of the sun. Keep your home as cool as possible. Shutting
> windows during the day may help. Open them when it is cooler at night.
> Keep drinking fluids.

Now I would never have dreamt of thought of doing any of those things.
Superb advice. May I suggest a couple of additional top tips.
> Avoid alcohol. An ice-cold beer may seem very tempting but does tend
> to dehydrate the body. Particularly if you have 7 pints of ice-cold
> beer.
> Avoid tea. The popular myth that 'Tea is so refreshing on a hot day'
> is just that - a myth. Tea contains caffeine and also tends to
> dehydrate the body.
>
> Remove extraneous clothing (within reason).
>
> If the sight of your partner stark naked (see above) gets you all hot
> and bothered, take a cold shower immediately. This will be far more
> beneficial than becoming all amorous which will only result in both
> parties getting even more hot and sweaty.
