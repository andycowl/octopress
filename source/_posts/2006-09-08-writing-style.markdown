Judy Rose has an interesting article on the importance of writing
[style](http://writingenglish.wordpress.com/2006/08/21/good-writing-it-makes-a-difference/)
and Paul Stamatiou also has some excellent
[tips](http://paulstamatiou.com/2006/08/26/5-steps-to-a-successful-blog-post/)
on structuring blog articles.

My writing style has many flaws. At work, I have a irritating tendency
to use 'padding' words that are completely worthless, superfluous and
unnecessary. For example, 'It was noted that...'.

This trait was first brought to my attention by the ruthless peer QA
review process which helped to reduce my deliverable documents from 78
pages to a more reasonable 12.

In my blog, I have also noticed that I tend to overuse the word 'So'.

So, I am working hard with my English teacher to eradicate these flaws
but please remember that old habits die hard.
