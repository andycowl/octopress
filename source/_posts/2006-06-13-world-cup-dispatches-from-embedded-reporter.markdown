Psst. I have managed to beat the banning order and have now safely
arrived in Stockholm (near Sweden). I evaded the hordes of police
spotters at Heathrow by checking in immediately behind a screaming
infant with a glum face (me not the baby). I also sported a linen jacket
and a laptop to complete my cunning disguise.

I was proudly telling a group of German ladies from Munich (World Cup
widows) of my escapades in the confines of the hotel lift. There was a
lengthy pause and they all looked really interested (or perplexed) until
a Deutsche freulein uttered:
> 'Until you insert your door card in that slot, we won't even be going
> to the 10th floor let alone Nuremberg, Englischer Dummkopf'.
