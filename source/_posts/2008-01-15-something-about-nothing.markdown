Yesterday, Norma collided with another car in a SW London rat-run.

The lady took Norma's details. I mourned taking out a high excess
(&pound;250). We were both thankful no-one was hurt, then I flew to
Newcastle and forgot all about it.

This evening, I spent 45 minutes on the phone discussing the fact that
nothing had happened

-   The lady never called.
-   The insurance company never called.
-   Nothing actually happened.

Nothing else was discussed. Why did this call take 45 minutes ?
