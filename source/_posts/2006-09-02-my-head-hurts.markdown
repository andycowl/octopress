Tough week. Lots of driving to and from the bleak, industrial North.
Lots of head scratching, pouring over computers and log files, talking
to different people, all working together to try to fix a difficult,
long standing, non-reproducible, high-profile problem.

Arrive home. After the emotional reunions, hugs and tears, I am
immediately asked to fix a difficult problem that is (thankfully)
reproducible. Son took advantage of my absence to buy another PC
[game](http://www.lionhead.com/bw2/). Game launches splash screen and
immediately crashes.

PC meets minimum spec. Graphics card meets minimum spec. Lots of people
have similar problems. Maybe they can't read
[books](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/06/13/helping-people-read-books/).
Read FAQ. Upgrade graphics card to latest Nvidia drivers. That should do
it. Still no joy.

Uninstall and reinstall game completely. Read interesting snippet in
README that is presented post-installation.

The 4 year old GeForce2 MX400 card does not support Pixel Shader 1.1
(silly me) so this graphics card does not actually meet the minimum
requirements.

Sigh. Uninstall game again. Turn off computer. Pray that son doesn't ask
about the possibility of upgrading the graphics card.
