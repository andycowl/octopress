Thank you for your email. I am currently working in a bunker deep
underground in the heart of Brussels (near Belgium).

I would normally say 'Please call me directly on my mobile'. However,
this secure facility is so secure that no mobile communications are
possible.

I would normally pledge to replying to your email on my return. However,
I am not quite sure precisely when (or even indeed, if) I ever will
return. While I am not literally chained to the desk, the security
officer is holding my passport which fills me with a sense of unease and
practically equates to the same thing.

The working environment is not ideal. Massive ceiling mounted fans in a
server room make for a cool, uncomfortable and noisy environment. Still,
this is my punishment for living in an ivory tower far divorced from
reality, waving my arms about and drawing architecture diagrams on a
whiteboard and I must accept it.

This particular customer insisted that, as a followup to a recent
architecture workshop, I return in person to install, configure and test
what I foolishly claimed was 'straightforward and trivial'.
