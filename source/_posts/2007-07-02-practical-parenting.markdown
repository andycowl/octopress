If you are the parent of a teenage girl, I have some fantastic news for
you.

Good news - You will never have to purchase an air freshener for your
car again. Ever.

I kindly gave my daughter and three girlfriends a lift yesterday. As
each young passenger boarded, pleasant smells and odours of various
perfumes and fragrances wafted and swirled around the car interior until
it resembled a perfume counter at Boots.

By the end of the journey, as I jettisoned my precious cargo, the smell
was overpowering and I started to feel positively nauseous and light
headed. 15 minutes later, I found myself slumped unconscious over the
steering wheel. Or rather, the police officer did. Thank goodness, I
passed that breath test and the policeman also had a grown-up daughter,
who has just graduated from Exeter University.

Despite opening all windows, the sun roof and leaving the boot open in a
futile effort to defumigate the vehicle, this pleasant smell will
persist for a period of six months, rendering the need for small,
refillable air fresheners that attach to the air vent grille completely
superfluous.

Bad news - the cost savings of the air freshener won't make up for the
unspecified and intangible costs of owning a teenage daughter.
