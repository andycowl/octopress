One of the reasons for the reduced blogging frequency, Kenneth, is
that I spend every waking hour devoting time to the thorny problem of
monetizing this humble blog. Previously, I experimented with
[Adsense](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2008/01/19/adsense-milestone/)
but sadly the revenue stream was insufficient to enable me to retire.

I am now pleased to announce the results of my research and
contemplations.

Do nothing. Absolutely nothing. Be patient. Wait. Don't get
frustrated.  Just wait.

Sooner or later, you will receive an email promising you riches and
wealth beyond your wildest dreams.

In return for posting a link to a Web site, I am going to receive a
goodie bag containing the following:

-   2 Packs of Love Hearts
-   1 Pack of Chewits
-   1 Pack of Black Jacks
-   1 Pack of Refreshers
-   1 Millions Tube
-   1 Pack of Giant Parma Violets
-   1 Chunky Drumstick Lolly
-   3 Packets of Fizz Wiz
-   1 Marshmallow Flump
-   1 Pack of White Mice or 1 Pack of White Chocolate Buttons
-   2 Snap Crackle Chewbars
-   2 Fruity Pops
-   1 Piece of Bubbaloo cola gum
-   2 Fruit Fizzers

'The Retro Sweets Pile comes to you packaged in a clear bag.'

...which is very important as if the goods were packaged in a brown
bag, people might think your were receiving sex aids through the post.

Prepare yourselves for a bunch of unobtrusive links to mindless,
desperate UK based SEO agencies appearing shortly. Prepare yourself
for a bunch of anecdotes about tooth decay and late onset diabetes.
