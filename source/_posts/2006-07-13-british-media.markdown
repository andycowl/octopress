Occasionally, I have had the odd dig at the parochial, inward looking
nature of the US TV and
[printed](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/06/14/the-imminent-death-of-newspapers/)
media.

However, last week, the UK media commemorated the first anniversary of
the July bombings in London with endless pages of words and pictures
together with and hours of footage, analysis, interviews, documentaries
and coverage of yet another two minute silence.

Since August 1997, a nation that was once renown for a 'stiff upper lip'
and dignity has somehow been transformed into 60 million professional
grievers and bereavement counsellors.

This week, four times as many people lose their
[lives](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/south_asia/2006/mumbai_train_attacks/default.stm)
in Mumbai in a set of horrendous train bombings by terrorists. Curiously
enough, this story is buried on page 13 after important updates on
corrupt politicians, corrupt businessman and corrupt footballers.

I presume all the people affected by this tragedy in India also have
mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters, sons and daughters, so put down
your paper, turn the radio off and spare a thought for them. May all the
victims rest in peace.
