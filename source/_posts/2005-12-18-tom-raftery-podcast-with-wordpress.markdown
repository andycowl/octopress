I just downloaded an interesting, wide ranging
[interview](http://www.podleaders.com/matt-mullenweg-podcast/) (sorry
podcast) by Tom Raftery with Matt Mullenweg and Donncha O'Caoimh, the
two leading developers behind WordPress. Matt and Donncha talk about
their backgrounds, hosted WordPress.com, features in 2.0, blogging,
spam, plugins and future WordPress developments.

Tom also happened to ask a specific question about my concerns for the
WordPress business model and Matt provided some reassurance that there
is a revenue stream through partnerships (hosting companies) so both
guys do have enough money to eat, drink Murphys and wear clothes.
