Just installed [SezWho](http://sezwho.com/) on this blog. At least, it
imported all existing comments (unlike
[Disqus](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/10/31/disqus-powered-comments/)).
I would like to change the red colour to blend in with the theme but
haven't worked out how.

Now just rate each other nicely or you will be sent to bed without any
tea and the plug-in will be removed. Any feedback, just shout or
comment.

Another interesting service but, again, the problem is that it needs to
be installed on the majority of blogs/wikis/forums in the world to be
truly useful. I think marketeers call it 'traction'. Pity the support
email supplied is totally
[broken](http://scobleizer.com/2007/11/15/venture-beat-has-better-blog-comments-sezwho/#comment-1424869)
but still.

What a blessed shame SezWho doesn't currently support Blogger which
means this superlative

couldn't add 5 stars to my embryonic profile.
