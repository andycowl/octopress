Last night's '[Money
Program](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/business/money_programme/default.stm)'
was about the increasing consumer demand for
[broadband](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/5234024.stm) services
and the various options available from the suppliers.

Broadband services from the major players (Carphone Warehouse, BT, NTL
and newcomer Sky) were all reviewed for various households with
different requirements.

British Telecom has an incredibly strong brand with the older
generation. One grandmother on the show simply opted for a BT Video
Phone because she implicitly trusts that the service will work because
'it is from BT'.

Another family opted for 'Free Broadband For Life' from Carphone
Warehouse. The kids were excited - lightning downloads, more MSN'ing,
online gaming. Mum was excited - she could actually use the phone again
for hours on end. Even Dad was excited - he was going to save 36GBP
every single month. Quite why he was still paying 15GBP per month for
dial-up wasn't clear.

In fact, they all thought it was too good to be
[true](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/04/18/too-good-to-be-true/).
And so it proved. They are still waiting for the engineer to arrive
despite Charles Dunstone moving them to the top of the massive waiting
list.

I have had broadband (Telewest) for so long I had to go and look it up -
April 2002.
