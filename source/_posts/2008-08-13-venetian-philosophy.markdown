Holidays are a time blissfully free of the modern distractions of
computers, mobile phones, games consoles, televisions and a time for the
family to spend some quality time together and eventually fall out.

Inevitaby, this leads to varied, interesting, thought provoking
discussions. During the Brightside annual vacation in Venice, the
following thorny questions were posed:

-   If you immersed yourself in a foreign country, how long would it
    take for you to become proficient in the language ?
-   If there was a 15 km stretch of beach resort including hundreds of
    young people, bars and restaurants in England, how many riot police
    would be required ?
-   If soldier ants are so damn clever, how come they didn't land on the
    moon first ?
-   When the bus was forced into that emergency stop, was it the German
    tourist or the Italian bus driver who screamed 'BASTARD' ?
-   What's the Italian for 'Cornetto' ?
-   If mosquitoes could be trained to attack people with the same blood
    group, would the bites be rendered harmless ?
