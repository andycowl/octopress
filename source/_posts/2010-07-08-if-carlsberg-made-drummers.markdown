They would probably produce Bryan Devendorf of The National.

- Plays the drums barefooted.
- Takes the demo tapes and composes the drum sections.
- [Writes][] intelligently.
- Drums immaculately.
- Performs his own, separate soundhcheck.

All things considered, I'm very glad I'll be witnessing The National
live again at the Brixton Academy on Wednesday 1 December.
