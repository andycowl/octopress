They would probably produce Bryan Devendorf of The National.

![Bryan Devendorf][]

-   Plays the drums barefooted.
-   Takes the demo tapes and composes the drum sections.
-   [Writes][] intelligently.
-   Drums immaculately.
-   Performs his own, separate soundhcheck.

All things considered, I'm very glad I'll be witnessing The National
live again at the Brixton Academy on Wednesday 1 December.
