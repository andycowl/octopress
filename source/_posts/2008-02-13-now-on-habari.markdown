I simply couldn't resist the temptation any longer so this blog is now
running on [Habari](http://habariproject.org/en/) because:

-   The Habari Administration screens look like they have been designed
    rather than evolved.
-   The WordPress import utility works brilliantly.\
-   Michael C. [Harris](http://www.twofishcreative.com/michael/blog/)
    created a TinyMCE
    [plugin](http://www.twofishcreative.com/michael/blog/2008/02/04/tinymce-habari-plugin-reaches-0-2-in-record-time)
    for Habari - literally minutes after my initial enquiry.\
-   Most of the required functionality (Google Analytics, Feedburner,
    Akismet, Sitemap) is available as
    [plugins](http://wiki.habariproject.org/en/Available_Plugins) for
    Habari.
-   Michael Harris also helped me configure rewrite rules so my existing
    WordPress permalink structure is retained.
-   A gentleman called [Harry](http://codeb.us/) from London developed
    this attractive Habari [theme](http://codeb.us/redarry-theme).
