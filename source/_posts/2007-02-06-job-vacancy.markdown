Travel Administrator for overpaid and unbelievably stupid IT consultant

    to Copenhagen from London Heathrow

    actually from LHR and not London City airport
-   must be able to secure approvals for travel booked less than 7 days
    from departure
-   must be able to verify a flexible ticket has indeed been issued as
    requested
-   must be able to convince the lady at SAS ticket sales to change a
    fixed, non-refundable, non-changeable ticket to a different flight

next nervous breakdown.

weekday.
