On May 21 2007, this newspaper published an
[article](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/05/21/the-tragic-case-of-madeleine-mccann/)
that was somehow misconstrued by some idiotic readers to imply that the
funds raised to assist with the search for the missing girl, Madeleine
McCann, were being misused by Gerry and Kate McCann to fund baby sitting
services and countless bottles of Rioja (Gran Reserve 1987 vintage) for
British holidaymakers (aka Tapas Bar 7) in sunny Portugal.

In the light of several hundred complaints from outraged readers and the
threat of legal action from the McCann's Press Office (which is
absolutely not funded from the Find Madeleine fund whatsoever), this
newspaper is pleased to offer a full and unequivocal apology to Gerry
and Kate McCann on today's front page.

After clarifying the original story with the unnamed sources, this
esteemed organ will now restate the facts of the matter once and for
all.

Not one penny of the funds raised (currently standing at over 1 million
pounds) have been misused in any way, shape or form by the McCanns.

We know this for a fact because the money in question has, in fact, been
used to make mortgage
[payments](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7068760.stm) on the McCann's 5
bedroom detached property in Leicester, near Rothley.
