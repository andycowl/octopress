[Doug Burns](http://oracledoug.com/serendipity/) recently was kind
enough to
[refer](http://oracledoug.com/serendipity/index.php?/archives/915-My-New-Favourite-Blog.html)
to my little, embryonic blog.

I had been lurking around the Oracle blogs for a while and had
commented on a posting on Doug's blog about his wife's positive
reaction to the recently launched Teleport service (TV and video on
demand)

Now this wasn't purely a trite comment is a desperate attempt to get
someone other than the Technorati bot over to my blog. I am a Telewest
customer and had previously remarked on the launch of the Teleport
service on my own
[blog](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2005/10/06/developments-at-telewest/).

However, it struck me that if I had been at UKOUG and if I had just
happened to be introduced to Doug Burns (an admittedly unlikely but
possible scenario), would I have uttered the same words to his face as
I posted on his blog ?

And, well, to be honest, I am still not sure. I guess it would have
depended on whether he was wearing a kilt or not.
