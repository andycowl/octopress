Extracted the shiny new Dell
[PC](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/03/09/sneak-peek-at-vista/)
from the tall cupboard yesterday. Pretended this PC was for 'homework
only', would solely use Google Docs and wouldn't connect to the
[Interweb](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/03/28/simple-things/).

Lasted two minutes before yielding and plugged in Linksys USB wireless
[card](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Linksys-WUSB54GSUK-MbpsWireless-G-Card-SpeedBooster/dp/B00065GXB4/ref=pd_bbs_sr_2/202-2514637-8721431?ie=UTF8&s=electronics&qid=1174950357&sr=8-2).
Briefly marvelled at the quality of the flat screen, then downloaded
drivers for Windows Vista, followed the instructions on the Linksys
technical support
[site](http://www-uk.linksys.com/servlet/Satellite?c=L_Content_C1&childpagename=UK/Layout&cid=1169671172872&pagename=Linksys/Common/VisitorWrapper&lid=9570243212B02)
and successfully connected to the burgeoning wireless network first
time.

Finally, Norman Junior III has his own PC, so now I will actually be
able to use my own computer whenever I please.

Expect a barrage of varied, humorous, exciting and detailed technical
blog articles and, yes, the
[frequency](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2005/12/20/whats-the-blogging-frequency-kenneth/)
will be doubled, Kenneth.

Or maybe not.
