Occasionally, people take the time to comment on this blog which is
always welcome.

However, the vast majority of comments however are not so thinly veiled
advertisements by spammers. Unfortunately, due to recent
[problems](http://andyc.tumblr.com/post/17830528) with 
[Spam Karma](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/07/10/out-with-the-old-in-with-the-new/),
I have had to revert to [Akismet](http://akismet.com/) to block this
torrent of pharmaceutical, financial, pornographic and 
[vacuum cleaner](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2005/12/19/probably-the-best-comment-spam-in-the-world/) 
spam.

This means I have a few more comments held in moderation for judgement.
The family convene every night with a cup of Horlicks to sit in
judgement on the assorted comments. Norma kindy takes the minutes and
Norman Junior twitters the whole event (live).

The 'Comment Approval Board' recently approved a comment from a heavy
metal fan. We took care to follow Akismet's
[advice](http://blog.akismet.com/2007/11/27/it-really-is-spam/) and
checked the [link](http://heavy-blog.com/) which purported that 'Heavy
Metal is our life'.

Approving this was not an easy choice but hey, this is a broad church
and everyone is welcome.

When I subsequently happened to scan the [SezWho](http://sezwho.com/)
[profile](http://picasaweb.google.com/nbrightside/Blog/photo#5138181312931498338)
of the author (a man with the unusual name of 'HeavyGod'), I found to my
horror, that he (or a program) had left the identical comment on
multiple blogs.
> 'Really good and really interesting post. I expect (and other readers
> maybe :)) new useful posts from you! Good luck and successes in
> blogging!'

The clues were all there. Commenting on a recent post sandwiched between
other valid comments, a gmail address, the double use of 'really', the
smiley, the compliment that I naively fell for. Hook, line and sinker.

I had been tricked. By a heavy metal fan. Oh the eternal shame.
