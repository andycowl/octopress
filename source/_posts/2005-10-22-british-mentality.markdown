I was flying back from Dusseldorf to London on Lufthansa
yesterday. For some reason, the kind lady at the check-in desk,
upgraded me to business class so I got a nice bread roll and cloth
napkin. The gentleman next to me was very disappointed that there were
no English language newspapers available on board. When the steward
asked why he didn't pick one up at the gate, he became even more
irritated, telling him in no uncertain terms that there were no
'English' newspapers at the gate and worse, not a single 'English'
newspaper in the business lounge.

So he finally settled down with a copy of 'The Economist' or so I
thought. Next thing the senior cabin director was summoned. This time
the gentleman, still, obviously disgruntled asked 'Are you trying to
cater for an international audience ?' The lady politely explained the
situation, apologised once again and offered to scour the plane for a
paper. Then he said 'What's the point of me paying extra money to fly
business class if you can't even offer me an English newspaper ?' and
finally let the subject die.

Two things struck me:
-   I bet his company, or more likely, his client are the ones paying
    the premium for business class and not him.
-   I was simply dying to say 'Well next time you fly on British Airways
    at 17.00 on a Friday to any German destination, why don't you see
    how many copies of 'Die Welt' and 'Der Spiegel' are available for
    German passengers ?'
