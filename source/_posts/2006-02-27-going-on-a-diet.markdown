I will stop wasting time evaluating every RSS reader in the universe and
simply revert to 
[NewsGator Online](http://www.newsgator.co.uk/ngs/default.aspx). 
This will help me
to read and enjoy content when I actually have the time and inclination.
This will also stop me being distracted by that insidious 'There is 1
new article' irritant which just leads to skim reading lots of
irrelevant material in a mindless urge to get 'up to date'.

I will endeavour to constrain my list of feeds to those that I actually
read and are of interest. The recent introduction of Technorati
[favo(u)rites](http://technorati.com/faves) proved to me that this
number was indeed less than 50.

And finally, Cyril. And finally, Esther. I will unsubscribe immediately
from Scobleizer's [blog](http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/). I am
starting to feel like a mindless sheep. I know millions read it and
discuss it. I subscribe to it and my eyes see the words but I don't
actually read it. He won't mind. He has a big enough audience. Baa.
