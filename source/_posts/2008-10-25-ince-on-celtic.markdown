Although I will always associate Paul Ince with the phrase 'big time
Charlie', I do think the Blackburn manager talks a lot of sense.

In particular, I think he was correct in his
[assessment](http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/r/rangers/7689580.stm)
of Celtic's display at Old Trafford on Wednesday night in the Champions
League. Apart from a few early promising moments, I think the gulf
between the two sides was embarrassing.

In fact, when I first tuned in to watch the game, initially I thought I
had got the dates mixed up and I was watching United playing Norwich
City in the Carling Cup.
