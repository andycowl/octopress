Airports are pretty dull places. Last Wednesday, I found myself at
Heathrow T2, at some unearthly hour in the morning. I wandered round
Dixons to have a quick look at the latest gadgets and kill some
time. I happened to see a couple of items I was interested in. The
first was Microsoft Office 2003 for Student Edition (3 user
license). I had already seen this on Amazon at 91GBP and Dixon's tax
free price was 110GBP which was, err, twenty pounds more
expensive. So, not exactly a brilliant saving at Dixons Tax Free
shopping there.

Secondly, a cheap MP3 player (Logik 1GB). This was only 63GBP at
Heathrow which was odd because the identical model is available for
only 54GBP in my local Dixons on the high street and has also been
advertised recently in the national press. So, another triumph for so
called Tax Free shopping at Dixons.

Even more odd is that Dixons have a large poster at the entrance to
the store proclaiming 'We beat Amazon/Tesco/Argos prices'. Now in the
light of my very limited price comparison of just two items, that
poster would seem to be misleading at best, downright dishonest at
worst and possibly in breach of trading standards regulations.

The poster implies to potential customers that Dixons are proactively
monitoring prices at three other major competitors and undercutting
their prices so you can buy from Dixons with confidence. I realise
that Dixons are under massive pressure from UK supermarkets (who sell
cheap DVD players alongside Cornflakes) and internet retailers. In
addition, Dixons' profits have also been badly hit by the decision to
stop forcing lucrative, extended warranties onto customers but is this
really the way to win business back.

Out of interest, I sent an email to Dixons for their thoughts....
