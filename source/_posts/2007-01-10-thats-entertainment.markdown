Two paltry efforts by yours truly to brighten up everyone's morning in
the Brightside household.

1. I decided to hoist my boxer shorts as high as humanly possible in
the style of [Borat](http://www.borat.tv/ms_blog/cannes.jpg) (although,
disappointingly, mine are black not lime green). You can only imagine my
wife's surprise and delight when she (finally) emerged from the bathroom
to be greeted by this unexpected and wonderful sight.

2. Fifteen minutes later, following a dramatic and rapid
transformation, I have changed into an immaculate dark suit, freshly
pressed, crisp white shirt and an expensive Italian silk tie. I lurk
outside the lounge door humming the theme music from James Bond. The
volume reaches a explosive cresendo and is climaxed with 'The Man With
The Golden Gun'.

I complete my preparations by carefully removing my weapon from the
black leather sheath and taking off the safety catch. I burst into
action and storm into the lounge announcing myself with the immortal
words 'My name is Bond - James Bond'.

Then I unleash a burst of rapid fire from my gun to eliminate the three
intruders lurking at the bay window followed by a head-shot to eliminate
the heavily built Russian henchman, cunningly hidden under the ironing
board in the playroom.

I athletically dive to the ground and shoot down the expensive crystal
glass candelabra. I throw an impressive triple roll across the carpet to
avoid the falling glass. I stand up to reassure the petrified children
'Don't worry. You are both safe now.' Finally, I demonstrate yet another
feature of my pump-action machine gun. I casually flick a switch and the
telescopic shaft extends, clicks and plumes into a black umbrella.

'Dad. Move. Your stupid umbrella is blocking the telly.'
