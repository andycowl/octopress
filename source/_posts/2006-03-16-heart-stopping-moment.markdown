Just went to delete 'whiteside.wordpress.com'.

Hit 'Yes' I am really, really sure I want to delete this blog for
eternity. Yes. I acknowledge I will never be able to access the blog
again or reuse the name ever. Or, in vi terms, ':q!'.

Received an email from the WordPress Workflow Monitor Agent. Clicked the
link to confirm I really, truly do know what I am doing and do indeed
want to consign the blog to Room 101.

[ Wonder why some ~~idiots~~ people end up posting on the Support Forum
'HELP !!! I've deleted my blog by mistake' ]

Watch in horror as browser fleetingly accesses 'andyc.wordpress.com'
instead and brings me to this dashboard. So, on second thoughts, I think
I will leave things just as they are.
