'[Most Haunted](http://www.livingtv.co.uk/mosthaunted/)' is a fantastic
TV program hosted by Yvette Fielding, where a Liverpudlian psychic
medium, Derek Acorah, visits haunted properties resurrecting the spirits
of dear, dead departed souls.

The program is notable for absolutely superb acting by Acorah who can
fulfill a variety of roles, effortlessly adopting the voice of tortured,
Victorian ladies, in pitch darkness, without the aid of a script.

The supporting actors (Fielding and the camera crew) are also superb.
They are simply wasted on Living TV. A career in Hollywood surely
beckons.

I was fortunate enough to catch a 'Best of Most Haunted' over Christmas.
It was simply the most riveting, compulsive, hilarious viewing.
