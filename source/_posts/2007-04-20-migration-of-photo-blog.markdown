Yahoo! kindly chose to close my Flickr! account because it was
associated with an additional email and not my primary Yahoo Id. I
contacted support in an effort to resurrect my Flickr account but to no
avail.

So, goodbye Flickr and hello Picasa. To get things underway, I proudly
present a couple of poor quality camera phone shots from my recent stays
in anonymous and overpriced hotels in
[Cardiff](http://picasaweb.google.com/nbrightside/Blog/photo#5055520817296205906)
and
[Oxford](http://picasaweb.google.com/nbrightside/Blog/photo#5055520890310649954)
respectively.
