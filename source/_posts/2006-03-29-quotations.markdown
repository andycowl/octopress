Tom Kyte has some favourite
[quotes](http://tkyte.blogspot.com/2006/03/some-inspirational-quotes.html)
so here are some of mine.

> Are you still doing what you did 5 years ago ? Yeah ? Well, don't make
> a career out of it ? (Mark. E. Smith)
> All over Battersea, some hope and some despair (Morrissey)
>
> As she parts her greying hair, voices on the stair (The Chameleons)
>
> Every twenty minutes on the Appalachian Trail, Katz and I walked
> further than the average American walks in a week (Bill Bryson)
>
> Doing so will result in obstreperous behavior, usually devoid of any
> amusement value. (Dynix/ptx manual on the dangers of mixing BSD and

>
> Is there really no beginning to your talents ? (Clive Anderson to
> Jeffrey Archer)
>
> Have you ever thought, just for one moment, that it might be you ?

And finally, for all you philosophers out there who managed to get this
far

> We may seem cold, or  
> We may even be  
> The most depressing people you've ever known  
> At heart, what's left, we sadly know  
> That we are the last truly British people you'll ever know  
> (Morrissey)

Only joking. Sorry about that, philosophers. Here you go.

> Those who forget the past are condemned to relive it (George Santayana)
