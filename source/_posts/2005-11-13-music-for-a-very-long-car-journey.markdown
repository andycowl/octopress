There is nothing more tedious than a blog that starts:

Mood: Restless. Currently listening to: X&Y, Coldplay

However I have just burned a CD in ATRAC3Plus format using Sony
SonicStage which contains 15 albums !

-   The Killers - Hot Fuss
-   Interpol - Antics
-   Snow Patrol - Final Straw
-   British Sea Power - The Decline of British Sea Power
-   The Chameleons - Live at the Academy (2 discs)
-   Morrissey - Beethoven is Deaf
-   Radiohead - The Bends
-   R.E.M - Reveal
-   Ride - Nowhere
-   Idlewild - The Remote Part
-   New Order - Get Ready
-   Interpol - Turn On The Bright Lights
-   Nirvana - Never Mind
-   The Chameleons - Strip
-   The Fall - Psykick Dance Hall (3 discs)

There was even 3MB left free. I don't care that ATRAC is a lossy
format.  I am used to listening to bootlegs on TDK 90's that sound as
though they were recorded in a bunker.
