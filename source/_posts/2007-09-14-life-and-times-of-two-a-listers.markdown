I like Robert [Scoble](http://scobleizer.com/). While I don't always
[agree](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/07/11/why-england-will-win-the-next-world-cup/)
with him and I have a love-hate relationship with his laugh, his blog is
worth reading and he posts some varied and interesting
[videos](http://www.podtech.net/home/category/editorial/tech/scobleshow/)
but one thing is obvious.

The guy has a real passion for technology and writing. On occasions, he
is subjected to vitriolic comments, hurtful criticism and abuse that is
completely unjustified but he calmly takes it all in his stride and
rarely
[retaliates](http://scobleizer.com/2007/08/29/wired-tired-linkbaiting-i-wish/).

Scoble is a family man and has a lovely wife. Indeed, he is a very lucky
man. As I recall, my wife didn't have the forethought and love to buy me
an expensive digital
[camera](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http://www.amazon.co.uk/Canon-EOS-Digital-Camera-24-105mm/dp/B000G2O1OS?ie=UTF8&s=electronics&qid=1189755270&sr=8-2&tag=paradiso&linkCode=ur2&camp=1634&creative=6738)![image](http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=paradiso&l=ur2&o=2)
hours before she went into labour. Inevitably, Scoble will be posting
live [updates](http://scobleizer.com/2007/09/13/babys-on-the-way/) of
his wife's lengthy and arduous labour via
[Twitter](http://twitter.com/). I'm surprised he isn't live streaming
the whole event.

Another 'A' lister recently admitted to hospital was Dave
[Winer](http://www.scripting.com/). Unfortunately, Dave repeatedly broke
rule
[two](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/06/09/7-habits-of-highly-ineffectual-bloggers/),
regaling us all with updates on his state of health.

3 September - The saga begins...

> 'Had to take a break, I got a really bad cold, the flu, not sure what
> -- but it knocked me down. I had a fever, nasty cough, wheezing, and
> it was getting worse so fast that I went to the emergency room at a
> Berkeley hospital, where they gave me something to control the cough
> and help me sleep, and today I feel much better.'

6 September - Our hopes are briefly raised. Don't laugh. This is a
disease !

> 'Yesterday was the first feel-good day after a horrible bout with
> whatever it was that hit me and dragged me under. But Naked Jen, who
> said she had the same disease, warned against believing you're better
> when you start *feeling* better.'

8 September - Our hopes are dashed but at least Dave received my email
of support.

> 'I've gotten email from people who are concerned. Thanks for the
> concern. Yes, I have seen a doctor, even went to the hospital to get
> chest x-rays. I don't have pneumonia. Just a realllly bad cold. A
> monster proportioned cold. It attacks everything but my sense of
> humor.'

9 September - My diagnosis is that this is not merely a heavy cold. This
is a life threatening bout of man-flu.

> 'It's been a really interesting morning, in a sick kind of way (that
> is, I'm still really sick, coughing and wheezing, rasping and
> sneezing).'

10 September - Dave manages to summon the strength to type a blog post
with no mention of his health.

11 September - A nation sighs with relief.

> 'Feeling *much* better today. Health is beginning to return. I owe it
> all to patience, lots of sleeping, drinking fluids, and not trying to
> be healthy before I actually am. Today I'm going to take a 20 minute
> easy walk in the sun.'

Winer by name. Whiner by nature.
