Norman - Your next post will be in the style of Micro-Blogging...

Monday - NSCR. Plaintive request from a customer to truncate a Siebel
intersection table. Siebel's official stance on the use of **any**
direct SQL to modify data in Siebel base tables is well
[documented](http://www.digitalteddy.com/techblog/2007/10/why_direct_sql_is_a_very_stupi.html).
However, for reasons that are too lengthy and tedious to divulge here,
this particular request was approved. Mainly because they deposited
&pound;2500 into my offshore account.

Tuesday - Team Meeting at
[BVP](http://www.oracle.com/global/uk/corporate/locations/birmingham.html).
Interesting to hear what my counterparts on eBusiness Suite do. Ate
[here](http://www.solihull-online.com/tiggis.htm). Not as dire as the
reviews suggested. Few beers in the interests of team morale.

Wednesday - Try (and fail) to avoid being dispatched abroad on my
birthday. Cristiano Ronaldo keeps going till the very last minute and
gets his
[reward](http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/7076590.stm). A
lesson to us all.

Thursday - Early start. Sleep downstairs on the sofa bed. Wake up 3
hours early. Fly to Amsterdam. Mundane Production Health Check for
Siebel 7.7 on SQL Server. Set up various monitoring tools (perfmon, OM
logging and
[Profiler](http://databasediskperf.blogspot.com/2006/06/finding-top-10-long-running-queries.html))
to identify low hanging fruit. There wasn't any. Staying close to
Schipol (good), far away from the city (bad).

Back to
[hotel](http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/amscy-courtyard-amsterdam-airport/).
Tired. Process email while thinking about
[lyrics](http://www.songmeanings.net/lyric.php?lid=123285) to
'[Sappy](http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=5BE1KRj5iiM)' and listening to
'[Low](http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=aiGxDQhKmec&feature=PlayList&p=6CF5A87C2B19F9AB&index=1)'
on a tight loop.
