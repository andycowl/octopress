Inevitably,
[Google](http://www.google.com/googlespreadsheets/tour1.html) enters the
online spreadsheet market to provide competition for
[ThinkFree](../2006/04/26/office-20-thinkfree). No charts (yet) and
limited invite only but it's coming.

As an aside, I don't use Excel much. My kids are much more
[proficient](../../2006/06/01/probably-the-best-world-cup-chart) at
producing pretty, colourful pie charts and histograms than me.

However, I also find it quite staggering that many sensible, intelligent
adults spend their lives in Microsoft Excel. A gentleman once emailed me
a spreadsheet and I hunted high and low across all tabs for any relevant
table data, pretty charts and forumlae.

Finally, I had to admit defeat and called him rather sheepishly. It
turned out the 'data' was simply plain, good, old fashioned text (words)
in various cells (paragraphs).
