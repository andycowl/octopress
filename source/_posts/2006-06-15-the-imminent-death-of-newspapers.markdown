I am one of those 40-50 year olds who disagree with Stowe Boyd who
predicts the
[death](http://www.stoweboyd.com/message/2006/05/hypergene_on_bu.html)
of newspapers 'in the not too distant future'.

I like newspapers. You can take them in the garden. You can take them on
the train, bus and plane. Newspapers are ubiquitous, relatively cheap
and convenient. Yes I could pay to download selected stories to my
mobile device but I've tried that and it simply doesn't work. My eyes
aren't good enough to squint at a miniscule screen.

Mind you, Stowe lives in America so, when you consider the quality of
printed media ('Cat rescued from tree') being thrown into his driveway,
maybe he does have a point after all.

Don't forget to check back in 10 years time to see who was right.
