The [Sandbox](http://wordpress.com/blog/2006/08/04/sandbox-theme/) theme
recently added to WordPress is pleasant enough but the original
[themes](http://www.plaintxt.org/themes/) developed by
[Scott Wallick](http://www.plaintxt.org/about/) from
[plaintxt.org](http://www.plaintxt.org/) are absolutely superb.

Clean, white, minimalist, striking, understated and refreshingly
different from the thousands of themes out there.
