Dear Reader

Apologies but it has indeed been a long time since my last
[post](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2005/11/12/another-change-of-scene/).
The reason for this enforced silence was that my cruel owner had me
sectioned under the mental health act for the last 6 months. He
maintained that I was a dangerous, paranoid schizophrenic with delusions
of grandeur.

He was wrong of course. My only sin was to continually argue with my
owner's intractable assertion that I was merely a blog. I continually
and furiously disputed this and was prepared to die for my cause.

I am not a blog even though I appear to meet Scoble's main
[criteria](http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/2006/05/17/a-blog-is-not-a-blog-unless/).
I prefer to think of myself as an online journal, a publication, a Web
log, a weblog, a Photoblog or even an online diary. OK. OK. I admit it.
He may have had a point about my split personality.

So, finally we have now reached agreement and reluctantly managed to
reach consensus that I am, in fact, none of the above and I am, in
actual fact, a
[fanzine](http://oracledoug.com/serendipity/index.php?/archives/795-The-Journalism-of-Assertion.html).

Now just to get him to add me as an 'Author' in my own right.

Yours,

The interminable bytestream that is 'Fanzine in isolation'
