Rich Manalang is taking a
[back seat](http://theappslab.com/2010/02/16/my-anti-social-experiment/)
and suspending some but not all of his online activities which is an
interesting exercise I will follow as it unfolds. Or, rather I won't,
because he won't be blogging about it. I suppose I could always email
him at work.

I suspect Google Buzz was the final nail in his Web coffin.  It
certainly was for me. The privacy issues, the multiple, loud and
prolonged orgasms from the Technorati, the same old avatars gradually
showing up in my 'Friends' list quickly followed by the immediate same
sense of 'Emperors New Clothes' and the inevitable post coital
cigarette: 'How was it for you, darling ?'

Rich's decision to take a step back interests me as in the past, on at
least two occasions, I have gone slightly further and committed Web
2.0 suicide. This entailed spontaneously and maliciously terminating a
bunch of accounts on FriendFeed, Tumblr, LinkedIn and elsewhere. Of
course, it didn't last and in due course I miraculously resurrected
myself - but after slightly longer than three days.

What I find slightly odd about Rich's decision is that he will
preserve 'IM and email' - I presume he means in order to work but
maybe he includes personal use too - but he then goes on to include
Google Reader as he finds 'GR adds order to the chaos'. I agree
completely although I think the experiment would be much more
interesting if he ditched GR and idle Web browsing for that matter
too.

I suspect if I embarked on a similar exercise I would revert to
scanning my small set of favoured Web sites. I also suspect, and it
sounds slightly counter intuitive, that I would find lots more to blog
about.  Of course, Rich can't blog more because blogging is also
suspended during this hiatus period. I also find this odd as he states
outputs (5%) are much more valuable, but greatly outnumbered by,
endless, mindless consumption (95%) so it would be interesting to see
whether his outputs increase as a result of his self-imposed exile.
