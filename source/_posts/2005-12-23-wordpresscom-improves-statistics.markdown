There are new, improved blog
[statistics](http://wordpress.com/blog/2005/12/23/new-stats-system-live/)
available from WordPress.com with more to come.

No additional Javascript needed. Integrated reports from the dashboard.
Superb.

As Matt said in a recent interview, these guys are active bloggers
themselves so they understand what users want, what is useful, what is
not and they also listen to feedback.
