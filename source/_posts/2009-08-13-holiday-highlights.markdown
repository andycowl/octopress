Memories of the annual summer vacation are now fading, the [digital
photos](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/09/03/a-short-history-of-digital-photography)
have been rationalised and printed, the video footage remains on the
[camcorder](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/09/03/how-a-digital-camcorder-drove-me-to-suicide)
(thankfully) and the entries for '[Holiday
Highlights](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/08/22/holiday-highlights)'
have now been received and short-listed.

Norma - 'So many memories. Catching up with friends and family, the
climate, the lifestyle, The awesome scenery of the Bungle Bungles, the
idyll that is Hamilton Island, sailing to Freemantle, cuddling a Koala,
the endless miles of white sand and blue sky at Cable Beach.'

Norman - 'When Norma spotted the first kangeroo in the wild but couldn't
tell anyone because she was squatting down in the bush, having a pee.'

Norman Junior III - 'When we were having that lovely Aussie sing-song on
the 4x4 truck, we ran out of songs and there was a brief silence until
Dad piped up with 'Maybe it's because I'm a Londoner.'

Norma Jeane - 'Free Internet access and those little drawers where you
can charge cameras, phones and iPods at Singapore airport.'

Auntie Vera - 'When Norma mounted the kerb while driving the beach buggy
on Hamilton Island. And nearly ran that lady over.
