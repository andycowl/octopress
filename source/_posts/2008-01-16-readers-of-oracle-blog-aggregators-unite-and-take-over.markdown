title: readers of Oracle blog aggregators unite (and take over)

'Forgive me Father for I have sinned. It is 25 years, 3 months and 47
days since my last confession.'

According to [Feedburner](http://www.feedburner.com), Tim Hall's Oracle
blog [aggregator](http://www.oracle-base.com/aggregator/index.php) has
723 avid readers.

One of those readers summoned up the courage to send me an email
complaining about my continuous off-topic posts. Apparently, the straw
that broke this particular camel's back was my participation in the evil
'8 things' Oracle
[TagFest](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2008/01/15/oracle-tagfest-the-last-word/).

Forget the fact, my blog is not currently aggregated by
[OraNA](http://orana.info/) which is purely a temporary oversight by
[Eddie](http://awads.net/wp/) and will be rectifed imminently (once my
cheque for $250 clears).

Forget the fact, I didn't tag 8 other unfortunates to propagate the
Black Death. That was only because I have no mates and am very lazy.

I can only apologise. I owe you, Roger Howard, an apology. I never meant
my inane posts to push technical content off the front page within 27.8
seconds.

I never envisaged that this blogging meme might possibly
'[inconvenience](http://www.dizwell.net/prod/archives/58)' you. May the
Lord have mercy on my soul. "Go in peace to love and serve the Lord. Oh,
hang on, I nearly forgot your penance. 67 'Hail Marys' and 43 'Our
Fathers'".
