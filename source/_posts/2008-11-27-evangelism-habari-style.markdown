Dear Prudence

That's excellent news. I am glad to hear you have managed to get PDO
installed and now have Habari up and running on your site.

As for how I happened to stumble across your site, well....

There's an army of committed, passionate Habari enthusiasts who
routinely conduct Twitter, Web and blog searches for every single
mention of the word 'Habari'.

In addition, one of the primary responsibilities of the mysterious
organisation - the [Cabal](http://wiki.habariproject.org/en/PMC) - is to
infiltrate Government intelligence agencies worldwide (GCHQ, NSA,
Mossad, KGB) and access transcripts of all mobile phone conversations
and SMS text messages. Sophisticated AI algorithms (grep with regular
expressions) are then used to mine that data, searching for Habari
related terms.

Then whenever we identify anyone using Habari, we leave a 'Welcome to
Habari. Enjoy the ride' comment on the blog.

If people are having problems, we desperately marshall all available
technical resources try to assist and claw them back from the abyss.

And if we discover individuals who have tried, failed, given up in
disgust and gone back to Drupal, Joomla or WordPress, well we pay them a
personal visit and shoot them :-)

Peace, love, empathy

The Habari Evangelist.
