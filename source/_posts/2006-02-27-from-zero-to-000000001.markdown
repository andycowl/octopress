I am following, with interest, the
[progress](http://www.stoweboyd.com/message/2006/01/starting_from_z.html)
of Stowe Boyd's [/Message](http://www.stoweboyd.com/message/) blog as
it gradually, inexorably climbs up the
[Technorati](http://technorati.com/) rankings.

Excellent subject for a blog. Plenty of interesting, free material on a
daily basis without any need for thought.

So I have decided to follow suit albeit a little late in the day.

> Day 194. Technorati Rank: 235,668 (23 links from 12 sites)

Tune in this time tomorrow to see the impact of my new black beret.

PS. How did I know it was day 194 ?
