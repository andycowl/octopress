Another criteria for the inverse law of
[airports](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/06/12/inverse-law-of-airports/).
The strange thing is, you are most susceptible and sensitive to a
screaming, inconsolable baby when you don't possess any yourself.

However, when you are a (recent) parent, you are too consumed with guilt
and embarrassment to even care what other people think.

Or, if you are an (experienced) parent, travelling abroad on business,
you tend to side with Frank Skinner, who memorably said:

'Oh she's tired. Bless her'.

'Well actually no she isn't, if she was 'tired', she would be asleep not
screaming blue murder'.
