You spend 3 months watching your WordPress statistics bumbling along the
horizontal axis close to zero.

Some traffic dribbles in. The graph accelerates into 10's of hits daily.
You feel better. You will persist with this blogging experiment for a
little longer.

At this rate, it may soon be time to consider a proper blog using
WordPress.org and Adsense to make the millions that eluded me during the
dot com boom.

Then those pesky developers from WordPress.com alter the Y-axis
dynamically, on the fly without even asking so the statistics now start
at 40 and the graph looks just the same.

Life is cruel.
