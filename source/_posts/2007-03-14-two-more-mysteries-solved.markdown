Two questions of earth shattering importance

1. 'Kingsbridge, Devon - where on earth is that - Somerset ?'
2. 'Look, Norman. There's something wrong with this darned phone again.
   Why is everyone continually engaged; my mum, my sister, Phyllis and
   now Doreen ?'

Answers:

1. Kingsbridge is in Devon.
2. There is nothing wrong with the telephone. Your mother, sister and
   close friends have a tendency to spend an inordinate length of time
   on the phone.
