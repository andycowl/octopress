Rejoice ! After 18 months, Rupert and Richard have ended their standoff
and the Sky channels will be
[returning](http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/digitaltv/a134623/sky1-sky-news-back-on-virgin-cable.html)
to Virgin Media.

Now, I wonder if some kind soul could fill me in on the last 18 months
of '[Lost](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/03/02/lost-without-lost)'.
