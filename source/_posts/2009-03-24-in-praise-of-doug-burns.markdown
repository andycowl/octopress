My longest standing and all-time favourite Oracle blogger is 
[Doug Burns](http://oracledoug.com/serendipity/)
of Edinburgh, near Scotland.

In addition to his sharp, analytical Oracle skills, helpful attitude and
easy going manner, Doug does a great deal of unsung, unpaid work for
charity (although, obviously he doesn't like to talk about it) and is a
fully paid up member of Amnesty International.

Doug is also passionate about the the causes of data privacy, security
issues, the freedom of information and continues to fight an unceasing
battle for the rights of the individual against the evil spectre of
Google Corporation.

For example, when Google recently sent those little Smart Cars out onto
the streets of Edinburgh to capture high definition images of the city
for [Streetview](http://googlesightseeing.com/maps?p=&c=&t=h&hl=en&ll=55.945818,-3.205508&z=17&layer=c&cbll=55.945732,-3.205471&cbp=12,268.1410328885411,,1,12.325581395348838),
Doug made his own personal feelings very clear.

Doug Burns - we salute you.
