[InterWeb](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interweb).

I think I first heard the term used, while working for a small Internet
company, by an Aussie. I can't recall whether we were laughing at him or
he was laughing at us.

Anyway, I now use 'InterWeb' at dinner parties, hotels and even in the
work environment. People used to stare quizzically but, sadly, no
longer. The term is now in common usage which somehow just makes it all
the more amusing.
