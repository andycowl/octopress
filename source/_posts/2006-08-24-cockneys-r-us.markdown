I was enjoying a stroll along The Embankment yesterday morning, dressed
in my Pearly King outfit, listening to Chas'n'Dave tunes on my iPod,
munching on cockles and mussels, when I noticed banners hanging from
each lamppost proudly proclaiming 'We are
[Londoners](http://www.london.gov.uk/onelondon/index.jsp)'.

The letter 'D' was shrunk to accommodate the rest of the letters. Just
like a kid writing a Thank You letter to Auntie Joan and suddenly
realising he's going to run out of space.

Inevitably, this brilliant campaign is the brainchild of Ken Livingstone
and sponsored by British Gas so if you pay the congestion charge or are
struggling to meet the recent increases in your gas bill, rest assured
your money is being spent very wisely.

Or, as Doug once memorably
[commented](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2005/12/20/the-killers-at-live-8/#comment-269):
'And your point is ?'

All together now - 'Knees up Maather Braawn'.
