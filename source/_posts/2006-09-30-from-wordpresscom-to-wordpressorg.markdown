Choose domain name which is
[taken](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/09/28/the-fickle-hand-of-fate/).
Choose another domain name.

Sign-up with [Dreamhost](http://dreamhost.com/) despite recent bad
press. All the other hosting providers look similar and all have
supporters and critics and, to be fair, Dreamhost were quickest (and
most helpful) to reply to a simple technical enquiry.

Payment processing takes a long, long time which is a little
disconcerting.

Install WordPress 2.0.4 using One-Click installation. Shortly receive
email stating 'Blog creation failed. Please try again later' which is
worrying.

Repeat installation of WordPress which is successful.

Export existing blog from [WordPress.com](http://wordpress.com/) into
XML.

Import XML into a local installation of WordPress 2.1 alpha (includes
all comments).

Import XML into new blog. Everything imported successfully apart from
the comments.

Install
[TechSailor](http://www.technosailor.com/wordpress-to-wordpress-import/)
plugin. Delete some posts with comments and repeat complete import.
Existing posts are skipped and import includes comments for some posts
but not others.

Delete complete WordPress installation, recreate mySQL database and
empty blog.

Install TechSailor again. Import XML which works fast and without error.
All posts, all comments, all categories are present. In fact, everything
is intact.

Change theme to the stunning
[Barthelme](http://www.plaintxt.org/themes/barthelme/) which was the
main reason for all this effort.

Upgrade Barthelme to the latest version (1.2.2).

Notice that the 'About' page wasn't imported and recreate.

Change permalink format to include name/date as used on WordPress.com.

Install [widget](http://automattic.com/code/widgets/) support and
configure sidebar widgets.

Activate Akismet plug-in (needs WordPress API key).

Install Google [Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/) tracking
code.

Stake my claim on [Technorati](http://technorati.com/).

Respond to amusing
[comment](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/09/28/google-reader-gets-revamp/#comment-913)
accusing me of blatant plagiarism.

Delete WordPress blog. Suddenly realise I didn't put up a closing
redirect entry. Oh well.

Put kettle on.
