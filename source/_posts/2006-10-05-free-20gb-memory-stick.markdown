[DreamHost](http://dreamhost.com/hosting.html) have upgraded the 'basic'
$7.95 per month hosting package from 20GB to a staggering 200GB disk
storage.

As this humble blog currently occupies 0.01%, I have plenty of capacity
for my photos, documents, CV (in txt, doc, PDF, LaTeX formats) and all
my
[homework](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/06/05/novel-homework-excuse/).
In fact, as my hard disk is a paltry 40GB, I have room for absolutely
everything.

And if that wasn't enough, Dreamhost are giving me a further 1GB every
week.
