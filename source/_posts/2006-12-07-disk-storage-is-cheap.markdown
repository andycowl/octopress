I find it weird that I can carry around
[4GB](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Integral-4GB-USB-Flash-Drive/dp/B000BRC906)
of disk storage in my pocket.

I find it staggering that I can buy a disk
[drive](http://www.dabs.com/ProductView.aspx?Quicklinx=3TVD&CategorySelectedId=11026&NavigationKey=11026&ExposedRefinement=0&InMerch=1)
with a credit card that could comfortably store 95% of all the
production Siebel OLTP databases I have encountered.
