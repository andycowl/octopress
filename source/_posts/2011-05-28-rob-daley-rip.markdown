The ticket allocations for the London 2012 Olympics haven't been
announced yet so I don't know whether I'll be watching Tom Daley
competing in the 10m platform diving semi final on 9th August.

If I do, I'll be sparing a thought and probably shedding a quiet tear
for Tom Daley's dad, Rob, who lost his 5 year battle against a brain
tumour yesterday.

Last year, I enjoyed a BBC documentary about Tom Daley where his Dad
interrupted a formal press conference to give his son a big hug,
thoroughly embarassing him in the process. You could just sense the
immense sense of love and pride Rob Daley had in his son.

Sadly, he will never get to see him compete at the London Olympics. 40
years old. Sometimes life just isn't bloody fair.
