For reasons that are too long and tedious to recount here, I have had
cause to rebuild my Lenovo T61 laptop many times over the last month,
using a bewildering range of operating systems, Linux distributions,
live CD's and dual boot configurations.

During this time, [gparted](http://gparted.sourceforge.net/) and an
external USB 500GB disk drive have become very close and reliable
friends. In fact, I have only lost data once and, inevitably, that was
due to my own stupidity.

Here are the invaluable Firefox plugins that I always install first:
-   [DownloadThemAll!](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/201)
    - download manager featuring multi-threaded, lightning fast,
    resumable downloads.
-   [is.gd](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/7369) - URL
    shortener.
-   [Diigo](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2792) - Great
    bookmarking service.
-   [Google Notebook](http://www.google.com/notebook/download) - Useful
    for random thoughts, reminders, lists of people who have crossed
    you, transient bookmarks and, well, notes.
-   [Firebug](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1843) -
    HTML and CSS diagnostics
