The observant reader will have noticed some minor changes to the
sidebar. The thousands of one hit wonders from Google won't.

1.  [Popular](http://alexking.org/projects/wordpress/) posts
    ([widget)](http://justaddwater.dk/2006/05/02/justaddwaterdk-wordpress-plugins/)
2.  [Related](http://www.w-a-s-a-b-i.com/archives/2006/02/02/wordpress-related-entries-20/)
    posts

3.  'Archives' gets a run in the first team, displacing the rarely used
    'Calendar' and 'Categories'.

I prefer using widgets to having to actually edit (and risk breaking)
the PHP code. Widgets always work with any theme.
Also, I thought it was odd that Google
[Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/) hadn't tracked a single
outgoing link since I installed this
[plugin](http://www.semiologic.com/software/google-analytics/). This
turned out to be a bug fixed by the most recent version.

I flirted briefly with installing Google
[Adsense](https://www.google.com/adsense/) but, in the interests of
purity and minimalism, decided against.
