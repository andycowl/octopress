I always was led to believe that Bobby Charlton and George Best didn't
get on. I read it in books and interviews and heard it from various
different sources. Of course, this fact wasn't a total surprise as the
two gentlemen did appear to be completely different personalities with
rather contrasting interests and, err, hobbies.

A month ago, I saw Charlton interviewed by Michael Parkinson where he
recounted his memories of the Munich air crash. Charlton also talked
about the frustration of playing alongside Best:
> 'So I made a run forward 'Pass it George, pass it.' George dribbles
> down the wing and cuts back inside. I move into space. 'Here George -
> pass it here. Now'. George continues on a mazy run past another three
> defenders. I move into the box 'George - come on. For God's sake, pass
> it now - oh what a great goal, George.'

Then Bobby Charlton recalled visiting Best with Dennis Law during his
final days in a London hospital. Best was drugged and drifting in and
out of consciousness and didn't recognise his two friends. Bobby
Charlton had tears in his eyes and his voice was quivering. It really
was an incredibly moving and emotional moment.
So, if anyone tells you Bobby Charlton hated George Best, just ask them
to watch that interview.
