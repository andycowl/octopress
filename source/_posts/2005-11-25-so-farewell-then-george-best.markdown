Not a brilliant week if you are a United fan...

A few years ago, I was drinking in the Chelsea Potter on the Kings
Road and a mate said 'That's George Best sitting over there'. I
replied 'Yeah, right'. I looked across to the bar and saw a plump,
bearded figure sitting on a barstool, clad in a hideous blue
shell-suit, sipping a Coke. I was stupified. After a while, he
finished his drink and left.  I was still gawping at him like a
lovestruck teenager and I swore he smiled at me on his way out.

Thanks for all the memories, George. RIP.
