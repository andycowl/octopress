After my recent
[move](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/09/30/from-wordpresscom-to-wordpressorg/)
from the community of WordPress.com, once again I truly feel like a
'Blog in Isolation'. There are a few
[features](http://wordpress.com/features/) I missed from WordPress.com:

-   [Dashboard](http://wank.wordpress.com/2006/09/28/dashboard-wank/) -
    I can still check the WordPress [blog](http://wordpress.com/), Top
    [Blogs](http://botd.wordpress.com/?lang=en) and Top
    [Posts](http://botd.wordpress.com/top-posts/?lang=en) independently.
-   [Forums](http://wordpress.com/forums/) - While I can still
    participate, I don't really feel like a member of that WordPress
    community any longer.
-   [Comments](http://wordpress.com/blog/2006/08/14/my-comments/) -
    signed up for [coComment](http://www.cocomment.com/) that tracks all
    comments (not just those on WordPress.com)
-   Tag
    [surfer](http://wordpress.com/blog/2006/08/13/related-tag-surfer/) -
    can create Technorati feed(s) to replicate this but this was a nice,
    dynamic feature.
-   New WordPress
    [themes](http://wordpress.com/blog/2006/10/10/new-theme-k2/) - If I
    like them, I simply download and experiment on this blog.
-   Latest WordPress posts - an occasional diversion. No real equivalent
    (unless I login to my placeholder WP account)
-   [Avatars](http://wordpress.com/blog/2006/08/30/new-feature-avatars/)
    - Not bothered but [favicon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favicon)
    is your friend.
