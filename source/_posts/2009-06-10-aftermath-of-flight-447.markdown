I probably shouldn't ask this question and watch a 'CSI New York' box
set to find the answer but still...

Bodies are now being
[recovered](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/8091582.stm) from
the fateful Air France flight 447 that crashed in the Atlantic ocean and
the authorities are requesting DNA samples from relatives in order to
identify the deceased.

So, what exactly does 7 days in sea water do to the human body ?
