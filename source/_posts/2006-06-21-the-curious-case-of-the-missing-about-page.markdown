[Collin](http://www.cornellfinch.com) from that esteemed, well respected
publication '[The Blog Review](http://blogreview.wordpress.com/)' was
kind enough to
[review](http://blogreview.wordpress.com/2006/06/16/andy-cblog-in-isolation/)
this humble blog and raised the thorny question of an 'About' page. The
absence of an '[About](../about)' page is one of Collin's pet hates and
[Lorelle](http://lorelle.wordpress.com/about/) also thinks they are very
[important](http://lorelle.wordpress.com/2005/09/28/who-the-hell-are-you/).

While I agree that background information about the author may be
interesting and contact details may be useful for establishing dialog
that isn't suited for comments, I don't think that the lack of an
'[About](../about)' page is necessarily a habit of an
[ineffectual](../2006/06/09/7-habits-of-highly-ineffectual-bloggers)
blogger.

For example, let's build my new, shiny '[About](../about)' page by
answering Lorelle's probing
[questions](http://lorelle.wordpress.com/2005/09/28/who-the-hell-are-you/):

*Who are you ?*
Norman Brightside (clearly a synonym so what's the point)

*What do you do ?*
I am a technical consultant for Oracle Corporation and try to help
people use Siebel and Oracle (read books) more effectively.

*What are you talking about ?*
Look at my Categories or scan the archives. Funnily enough, customers
often ask me the same question.

*What will you be talking about ?*
Most likely the same subjects as I have talked about in the past.
Subscribe to the feed if you care that much.

*What gives you the right to talk about anything ?*
Absolutely nothing. This is purely my wooden crate in the corner of Hyde
Park.

*What are you doing here ?*
What do you mean - you weren't expecting me until tomorrow and there's
no desk and computer for me.

*Why are you doing it here ?*
Because publishing a book takes time and money.

*Who the hell are you ?*
Now, now. Language, Lorelle.

And a couple of questions of my own:

*Where are you ? London, near England.*
How can I contact you ? Comment. I can see your email address but no-one
else can.
