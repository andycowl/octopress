I am sorry Wayne Rooney broke a toe and will

the World Cup.

I am not sorry for England.

I am not even sorry for Manchester United.

I am sorry for a 20 year old Scouser whose first chance to realise a
lifelong dream has been ended.

Unlike ten other players wearing red shirts on Saturday, he was making
every effort for the entire 93 minutes to score a goal for United
against Chelsea. Like the rest of the United players (Gary Neville
excepted) he could have just gone through the motions, watched the ball
pass by, play out time and applaud the United fans as he trudged off
Stamford Bridge.

But no - even with three minutes left of a meaningless game in a season
of failure that is now finally over, Wayne Rooney was still trying his
heart out and making every physical effort to drive the team forward.
