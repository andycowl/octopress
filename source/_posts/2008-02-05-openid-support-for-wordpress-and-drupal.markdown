Adding support for [OpenID](http://openid.net/) to Wordpress using this
[plugin](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/openid/) is quick and
straightforward.

Similarly, the latest version of Drupal
[includes](http://drupal.org/node/152893) a core module providing full
support for OpenID integration.

So, if you have an OpenID, you can now use it to comment on this blog.
