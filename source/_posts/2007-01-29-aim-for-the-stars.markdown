Meet [Dan Morrison](http://www.ittoolbox.com/profiles/dan_morrison). His
main aim in life is :-

> Currently dedicated to linking **all** IT professionals together in
> one network so they can find each other and communicate.

Don't scoff. Dan already has 93,822 connections (including me) on
[ITtoolbox](http://www.ittoolbox.com/) so he's very nearly half way
there.
Dan - Let me know when you've finished and I'll have that list of email
addresses in exchange for a box of vintage 1980's records.
