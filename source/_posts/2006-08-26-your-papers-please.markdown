Just returned from the annual torture of the seemingly simple task to
renew two parking permits. Yes folks, we have to pay for the privilege
of parking our cars in a nearby road, miles from our house.

To secure the parking permits, you need a wad of paperwork. In fact, you
probably need to produce fewer documents to adopt a Rumanian orphan. If
you have two vehicles registered to one person but used by two different
people, the documentation requirements and level of complexity increases
exponentially.

This year, I didn't do too badly. I only had to make two separate trips
and enjoyed one lengthy, heated discussion. Despite this, my paperwork
was still deficient in two areas but the kind lady let me off with a
thinly veiled warning: 'I'll issue the second permit on this occasion
but next year, please ensure you bring **everything** with you.'
