The 80's pop star - Prince - simultaneously delighted both his fans
and horrified the music industry with his shock inclusion of a
disposable CD with a leading (shurely shome mishtake) UK Sunday
newspaper.

Norman Brightside, an avid Daily Mail reader, was absolutely delighted
with the complimentary inclusion of 'Planet Earth' with his
&pound;1.40 Mail on Sunday.

Zzzzzzzz.
