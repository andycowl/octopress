Ladies and Gentlemen

1.  The [Slashdot effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slashdot_effect)
2.  The [Digg effect](http://www.shaolintiger.com/2006/01/20/i-got-digged-the-digg-effect/)
3.  The lesser, spotted [Kyte effect](http://thinkoracle.blogspot.com/2005/12/thomas-kyte-effect.html)
4.  The incredibly secure [Pete Finnigan effect](http://oracledoug.com/serendipity/index.php?/archives/880-The-Pete-Finnigan-Effect.html)

Please welcome, the latest addition to the effect family, the 
[Doug Burns effect](http://oracledoug.com/serendipity/index.php?/archives/873-Bits-and-Pieces.html),
which has increased traffic to this blog to new, world record highs and,
even as you are reading this, is relentlessly propelling this humble
blog towards 'Top WordPress.com blogs today'.
