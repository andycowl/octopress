In a previous
[article](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2005/11/29/new-regulus-theme-for-wordpresscom/),
I wanted to add a trackback to properly cite an article on Ben
Gillbank's blog about his Regulus theme.

I couldn't find the trackback URL but, as ever, WordPress is doing all
the donkey work for me and now I see my posting does indeed appear as
a comment in Ben's original article.

No manual intervention, head scratching or wasted time. Exactly as it
should be.
