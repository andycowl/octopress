I'm confused.

Arsenal are playing like Chelsea.

Manchester City are playing like Brazil.

Manchester United are playing like Manchester City.

Chelsea are playing like Northwich Victoria.

Tottenham are playing like Wigan Athletic

Derby are playing like Watford.

Chelsea players are haranguing match officials like Manchester United.

Emmanuel Adebayor is playing with the swagger and arrogance of Thierry
Henry.

In fact, I am so confused I am taking a day trip (and prawn sandwiches)
to the Emirates Stadium next Sunday to watch Arsenal versus Sunderland.
