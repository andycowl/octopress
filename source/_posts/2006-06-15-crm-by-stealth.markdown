I was travelling on a train in Stockholm today when a man walked through
the carriage selling something. Unlike London, he wasn't flogging copies
of the 'Big Issue' to feed his dog or demanding money with menaces.

Instead, this gentleman simply proceeded to place small cards on each
vacant seat. He did this very quietly and politely and then returned to
his original position. Despite craning my neck and desperately trying to
look at the cards while simultaneously trying to look completely
disinterested, I couldn't actually discern what was on offer.

This lapse was caused by an innate fear of missing my stop and spending
another 75 minutes trapped, wandering aimlessly in the rabbit warren
that is Stockholm Central Station. However, I managed to determine that
it was either an English language school with beautiful, buxom blonde
teachers or Stockholm's newest lap dancing bar.

To my amazement, after 2 minutes, the gentleman repeated his walk
through the carriage, reclaimed all of the cards which had lain
undisturbed by any passengers. He then disembarked, presumably to repeat
the exercise on another train.
