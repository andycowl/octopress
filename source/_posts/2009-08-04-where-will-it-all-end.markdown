Last year, I found an ancient 56Kb dialup modem lurking in a cupboard. I
fondly remembered the days of dangling the extension cable diagonally
across the bedroom floor (which often tripped unsuspecting visitors up)
and mentally replayed the connection tone.

And now Virgin Media
[announce](http://pressoffice.virginmedia.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=205406&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=1307695&highlight=)
50Mb for &pound;28.
