One reason I am slightly averse to presentations is that I once attended
a 'Presentation Skills' course that unequivocally stated 'There is no
room for humour in presentations'.

I fundamentally disagree with this assertion.

For example, I think this
[presentation](http://tkyte.blogspot.com/2005/11/something-to-aspire-to.html)
is very interesting, thought provoking, refreshing and different. Does
it contain humour ? Not directly but then why are people laughing
throughout ?

It contains repetition, repetition, repetition which helps to enforce
the underlying point (selling his company).

It is brilliantly delivered and undoubtedly very well rehearsed but it
is memorable and different.

So today, I have slides with the following quotations:

> 'I can't manage it. It is Siebel - Anon'
> 'I don't understand it. It is Siebel - Anon'
>
> 'I can't tune it. It is Siebel - Anon'
>
> 'Siebel is just some data in some tables - Me'

This isn't humour although it gets a (nervous) laugh but it is intended
to encapsulate the message of the next two days. So I will repeat these
quotes at various points to reinforce the message.
