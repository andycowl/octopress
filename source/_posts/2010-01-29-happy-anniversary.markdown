This year's Carling Cup Final between Aston Villa and Manchester United
will take place at Wembley on Sunday 28th February 2010.Curiously, this
date marks the exact 34th anniversary, to the very day, of Manchester
City's last trophy.

After United defeated Millwall 3-0 in the 2004 FA Cup Final, all the
United players changed into shirts numbered '36' in a tribute to the
young player, Jimmy Davis, who had recently died in a car
accident.

Today I have written to the club to see whether United could do
something similar to mark the anniversary of Dennis Tueart's
spectacular overhead kick that beat Newcastle in the 1976 League Cup
Final. My proposal is for United to sport shirts sporting a MASSIVE
'34' while Dennis Tueart could be the club mascot for the day, wearing
a pale blue and white retro scarf.
