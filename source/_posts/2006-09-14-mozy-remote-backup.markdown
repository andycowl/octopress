I briefly used
[Box.net](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/04/19/1gb-memory-stick/)
as a virtual 1GB memory stick. Briefly because after the initial
transfer of important files, the onus was on me to identify files I had
changed recently and upload them.

[Mozy](https://mozy.com/?ref=L57WLN) seems better suited to lazy people.
You simply download a lightweight client, identify folders you want
mirrored and Mozy encrypts and mirrors them, quietly in the background.

When you add new files, Mozy mirrors the incremental changes. Mozy
offers 2GB of storage for free.

Also, Mozy includes the phrase 'Reticulating splines' during
initialisation.
