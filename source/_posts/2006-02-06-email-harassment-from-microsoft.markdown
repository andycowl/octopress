The BBC [reports](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4682462.stm) that 1
in 8 people have been 'harassed by email'. But what is amusing about
this story is the screenshot that shows an Inbox displaying emails
originating from
['support@microsoft.com'](mailto:'support@microsoft.com').

Careful. Microsoft is a large, powerful American company. I wouldn't be
surprised if their lawyers are not initiating legal action as we speak.

The story itself reminds me about of the old joke about sexual
harassment in the workplace where the employee goes to complain to Human
Resources about not getting any.
