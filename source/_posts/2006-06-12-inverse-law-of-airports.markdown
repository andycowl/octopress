The larger the airport, the longer it takes to drive there, check in,
clear security, order a sandwich, find a seat in the lounge, secure a
taxi.

In my limited experience, Heathrow Terminal 3 is pretty poor. Some
small, anonymous airfield in Switzerland is the best. You pick up your
own bags from the runway, walk to an empty terminal building and you
even get to stamp your own passport.

BTW - England have just beaten Argentina 1-0 in the World Cup. Owen took
a dive for a penalty converted by Beckham and Nicky Butt was absolutely
outstanding.
