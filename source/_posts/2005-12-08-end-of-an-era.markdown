The Glazer takeover was not the end of an era. Manchester United is a
PLC not a football club.

The departure of Roy Keane was not the end of an era. Players (even
great ones) come and players go.

The death of George Best was not the end of an era. Death and taxes.

However, last night's 2-1 defeat to Benfica in Lisbon just might be.
