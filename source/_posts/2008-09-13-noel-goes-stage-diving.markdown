I have a penchant for some of Oasis' tunes and, although he's a City
fan, I also like Noel Gallagher.

I like his sense of humour, I like his professional Mancunian accent and
his occasional

at United. I also agree with him that Morrissey's lyrics are hilarious
rather than morose.
I also love some of his quotes. Just one recent, brilliant
[example](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/celebritynews/2567284/Noel-Gallagher-calls-Amy-Winehouse-a-destitute-horse.html):
> 'Amy Winehouse is like a destitute horse.'

Having said all that and although I abhor physical violence and drunken
behaviour, this recent clip of Noel doing some impromptu stage diving at
a Toronto concert raised a smile.

If you want to skip the 'Morning Glory' intro, the incident happens at
1:30. It was just a good job for the culprit that Liam didn't manage to
get hold of him !
