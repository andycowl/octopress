London - 5 November 2007

The football world was left reeling after Norman Brightside was fired
last night. The long serving manager of Whiteside Wanderers was
summarily dismissed when the club released a terse statement on their
website.
> '36 points. That's rubbish. You're fired.'

After a pre-season of great promise, big money transfers and high
expectations from fans, Whiteside Wanderers have endured a poor start to
the season and are positioned second from bottom after a string of
inconsistent performances and bad results.

Brightside defended his record: 'Don't look at me. Look at the players.
They just haven't performed. The team has continually been wracked by
injuries (Scholes, Rooney), suspensions (Ronaldo, Carsson) and loss of
form (Berbatov).'

The Chairman offered a slightly different view: 'The manager's lost it.
He has made some bizarre selections (Noble, McShefferey). His stubborn
refusal to even contemplate the purchase of a Liverpool or Manchester
City player was the last straw. I negotiated a deal with Liverpool to
get Gerrard for &pound;56 million but he refused. The man is a stubborn idiot
and is living in a fantasy world.'

Brightside was left fuming at claims he had 'lost the dressing room'.
'That's absolutely absurd. The dressing room is on the right just after
the toilets. I can find it with my eyes shut.'

Brightside was coy about his plans for the future and refused to confirm
or deny rumours of a &pound;7.50 pay-off. The tabloid press are convinced he
will team up with Sammy Lee and take over at managerless Stevenage, a
Subbuteo team languishing in the Ryman Premier League.

'Some think Stevenage would be a retrograde step but there's great
potential there. Besides, Sammy wants to go somewhere where the players
look up to him.'
