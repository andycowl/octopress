A couple of people stumble across this blog searching for the 'History
of Oracle' but ultimately go away
[disappointed](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2006/02/01/a-short-history-of-oracle-blogging/).

For those people, there is a brief but interesting timeline (covering
1977 to 2001) detailing the development of Oracle Corporation in this
freely available screensaver available from
[Club Oracle](http://www.oracle.com/cluboracle/screensavers.html).

The screensaver is the one titled 'Oracle Defining Moments - 25 Years of
Technology Innovation'.
