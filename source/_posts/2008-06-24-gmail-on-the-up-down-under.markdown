Although it's very cool to post on the corporate message board: 'Hey -
why don't we save the company millions of dollars by using Linux, Gmail
and OpenOffice ?', there are obvious barriers (security and Excel
luddites to name but two) to large corporations adopting server based
software.

However, I always thought Google Mail would be an obvious fit for
academic institutions to reduce the costs of software licenses and IT
management. Adoption of such 'software as a service' would make sense as
although some students are 'late risers', the majority could also be
classified as 'early adopters' who are comfortable with the technology.

This recent
[announcement](http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/06/23/15-million-australian-students-dump-outlookexchange-for-gmail/)
that the Department of Education in New South Wales will roll out (a
customised version of ) Google Mail to 1.5 million students is an
interesting development.

The cost of the new system will be $9.5 million as opposed to the $33
million for the previous Exchange/Outlook based solution with students
getting an increased quota of 6GB (previously a miserly 35MB).

Although the initial contract is purely for email services for students
only (no Google Talk), the obvious extension is to include Google
[Docs](http://www.nbrightside.com/blog/2007/06/28/google-finally-sees-sense/)
and Spreadsheets to displace Microsoft Office.
