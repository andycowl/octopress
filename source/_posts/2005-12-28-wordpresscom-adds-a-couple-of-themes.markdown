WordPress made some changes to the available
[themes](http://wordpress.com/blog/2005/12/24/fauna-and-regulus/) just
before Christmas which I have only just noticed.

I particularly like the changes in
[Regulus 2.0](http://www.binarymoon.co.uk/2005/12/regulus-20/) by Ben
Gillbanks as you can now customise the theme a little. You can choose
to have the calendar displayed (Howard will be pleased), change the
'Blogroll' to use link categories, change the header image and the
colour scheme.  Also, the irritating 'Message essage' bug is fixed.
